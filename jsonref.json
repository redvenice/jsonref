They have tremendous loyalty to both parents and learn early on to navigate between the two camps.They hate to hear their parents slagging off each other and generally decide that total discretion is the wisest modus vivendi – rarely telling one parent anything about their time with the other.I remember freaking out when I learnt, through a third party, that my son Sam, then six years old, had slept in his father’s Majorcan bar during his stay with him. But Sam never mentioned it to me, nor seemed particularly put out when I raised the topic.Children are very accepting of each parent’s character and, as they grow up, instinctively understand their respective strengths and weaknesses.There have been countless times when, annoyed as I may have been with my ex, I have known that he would have a better take than me on one of our child’s worries. At moments like this, shared responsibility is a relief.Divorced parenting is never easy but the best thing you can do for your kids is to try to ensure they have an equally strong relationship with both parents. This is far more likely to be achieved if their custody isn’t entrusted to only one – and they aren’t fought over like a property portfolio.Christmas cookies make me crumbleThe Christmas Lakeland catalogue arrived this week, triggering my first bout of seasonal low self-esteem.The pages are filled with products for the kind of festive home that I have never achieved.Are there really people who whip up gingerbread Christmas trees and Nutcracker soldier cookies?

As a country we need to be thinking big and flaunting every asset we have. Pomp and pageantry is one of our star turns, and nobody ever turns down an invitation to Buckingham Palace, nor I bet, would they to Britannia 2.Industrialists love a yacht, and a floating Royal conference room advertising the attractions of doing business with Britain would easily repay the £60 million a new vessel would apparently cost. Especially if it were William, Harry and their attractive families on deck – rather than Air Miles Andy.Oh brother, that was a £200m mistakeIt’s often said that you only need one good idea to make your fortune. The trick is to recognise it.Many years back my younger brother was working as art director on what was then Harpers \u0026amp Queen magazine when the junior beauty editor approached him to ask for his advice.She said she felt stuck in her job and was thinking of leaving to start up a mail-order company selling white sheets and pillow cases.His reply? ‘That’s the nuttiest idea I’ve ever heard. Whatever you do, don’t do that. Hang on in here. I’m sure you’ll get a promotion soon.’The young woman was called Chrissie Rucker. And her idea?

The Spice Girls are reuniting for a tour that is going to net them a couple of million each - but they are having to do it without Posh SpiceVictoria’s too Posh to push the Spice GirlsThe Spice Girls are reuniting for a tour that is going to net them a couple of million each. But they are having to do it without Posh Spice, who has refused to join in. And no wonder. For Victoria Beckham those takings are chicken feed, and why would she want to revisit the past? There comes a point where a Wannabe becomes a Hasbeen.When I interviewed Victoria in 2008 for her first Vogue cover story, she was performing in the last Spice Girls tour.She invited me and my family to come to the show and welcomed us into her dressing room where, as David fixated on his phone, she was done up in full Posh regalia – squeezed into a shiny bronze catsuit, caked in fake tan with a stiff helmet of hair gel and tottering around in platform shoes that make her normal stilettos look like comfy slippers. Ten years later her world has moved on and she is now a sophisticated fashion designer whose every public appearance is an advert for her business.Any hint of a latex catsuit could kill that hard-won brand image stone dead.  The annual Victoria’s Secret show took place in New York last week featuring models of the moment Gigi Hadid (right) and Kendall Jenner (left)Is this really what a feminist looks like?The annual Victoria’s Secret show took place in New York last week featuring models of the moment Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner.The performance is part pin-up calendar, part rock concert, with the highly paid girls strutting their stuff on the catwalk in minuscule strips of lingerie accessorised in exotic bondage style.Quite where this sits with the proclaimed #MeToo values of these hugely successful models is hard to work out. Personally, I’m all for women being able to wear as little or as much as they are comfortable in and have no problem mixing a sequined thong with feminism.But where I do get confused is how the girls expect men to react to them in these overtly sexual costumes. Modern-day feminism is all about escaping from the tyranny and subjugation of the ‘male gaze’, so this seems a funny way to go about it."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/11/08/00EB1B8B00000190-6376709-image-m-6_1541925874818.jpg","title":"Boxing legend Chris Eubank 52 gets job marshal Louisiana","story":"    Boxing legend Chris Eubank has reportedly become a city marshal in Opelousas, Louisiana  \u0027Chris is over the moon with his new roles and takes them very seriously,\u0027 a source told The Sun.\u0027He may have had run-ins with the law but he is a reformed character and hoping to spread peace across America.\u0027He is lecturing on how to defuse messy situations using words, not punches, which is ironic given his background.\u0027          The former world champion, 52, has no formal police training and has a criminal record in the UKThe ex-world super-middleweight, who was declared bankrupt in 2005 over an unpaid £1.3 million tax bill, has been giving lectures on how to \u0027peacefully defuse difficult situations\u0027 in Louisiana.He\u0027s been offering advice on how to avoid conflict with the law - despite the fact he was arrested twice himself.  Chris Eubank pictured \u0027putting his OWN parking ticket on...Share this articleIn 2005, he was charged with \u0027taking a beer lorry without consent\u0027 after threatening to assault the driver.And two years earlier, he was arrested after driving a 4x4 to Downing Street in a protest of the Iraq war.

Until now.For the Prince of Wales has given a mouthwatering insight into what sets his taste buds tingling by revealing that his ‘favourite recipe’ is . . . pheasant crumble pie.And the heir to the throne likes eating game birds so much he has ‘invented’ a possible successor to that dish’s place in his affections — a moussaka made with grouse, instead of the usual lamb, which he calls ‘groussaka’.His craving for such culinary creations will be revealed in next Wednesday’s edition of Country Life magazine that he is guest editing to mark his 70th birthday, which falls on that very same day. In it, Charles tells how he owes his fondness for pheasant crumble pie to a friend, saying: ‘I got this recipe from someone I know.

Pheasant. Crumble. Pie. Surely it’s either a crumble or a pie, but it can’t be both?After poaching, you cool and shred the pheasant meat (breasts only), strain and reduce the stock, then spike it with sherry. After making a roux with flour and butter, you use the stock to make a thick white sauce. Then you mix it all together, top with breadcrumbs, cheese and bacon before baking in the oven. It sounds ine! Not having the Ritz kitchens, a palace or a personal chef at my disposal, I decide to make it myself. After all, what could possibly go wrong?So I order a pheasant from C Lidgate, the prestigious West London butchers beloved of royals and Richard Branson, but don’t let that put you off. It comes from Norfolk although not the Sandringham Estate, but that is close enough for me. I poach it as instructed, then boil the stock to reduce.Neither Mr Williams nor Prince Charles mention the scum that gathers on the surface, as is usual when boiling fowl. Perhaps you just can’t have that word in a royal recipe? I skim my scum surreptitiously.The breadcrumbs are an outrageous extravagance, fried in 170g of butter, almost three-quarters of a pack. Even after drying them, they are still a mound of engorged butter bombs. To intensify the decadence, parmesan cheese and crispy bacon are added, before the dish is baked in the oven.So what does it taste like? Really rather delicious, although it is incredibly rich. Savoury, soothing and surprisingly economical, it is exactly the kind of comfort food one might expect the Prince of Wales to adore. White meat only and lashings of dairy, with a crispy topping and a buttery overload all add up to a decadent supper fit for a king-to-be.It is retro nursery food given a touch of luxury — the kind of food that has fuelled the Monarchy for hundreds of years.PHEASANT CRUMBLE PIEFor two people:1 pheasant                                                  £4.95Bacon                                                            70pVegetables \u0026amp herbs                               £2Pack of butter                                           £2(Plus a splash of £10-a-bottle sherry)                                                              Cost £9.65                                                    Houses for sale, properties for sale - Country Life"},{"url":null,"title":"McDonalds chief eats fast food chain TWICE day claims Britain strike Brexit deal","story":"How High Street sandwiches compare to the vilified Big Mac burger from McDonald\u0027s      Not so Happy Meals!

Cats were known as \u0027Mau\u0027 and were later important in Egyptian society and became a symbol of grace. It is believed the ancient Egyptians cared for domesticated cats as long ago as in 3,700BC.

However, other sources suggest he was married to Queen Khentkaus.It was under his reign that the cult of Ra, the Sun God, started to gain importance.He built the first of a series of temples to Ra at Abu Sir, north of present-day Cairo, on the west bank of the Nile. Userkaf built his pyramid circa 2490 BC in the shadows of Djoser\u0027s Step Pyramid - an archaeological jewel in the Saqqara necropolis built around 2700BC for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser.The pyramid complex of Userkaf consisted of an outer casing of fine limestone, around a core which at some point crumbled into rubble.For this reason, it is known locally as El-Haram el-Maharbish, the \u0027Heap of Stone\u0027.Userkaf\u0027s pyramid forms just part of a larger mortuary complex, which includes an offering chapel and mortuary temple.

We were desperate. If they had said they could sprinkle fairy dust and it will make you pregnant we would have bought it.’      \u0027Looking to transfer before Christmas\u0027: Brooklyn actress,...Thousands of young women battling cancer given fresh...Share this articleThe HFEA has warned this screening can show up non-existent problems and does not benefit women aged over 37. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, the couple told how doctors ‘dangled’ treatments in front of them when they were at their most vulnerable.During one IVF round, Mrs Wint recalled that Oxford Fertility staff told them it’s ‘up to you’, but they ‘might look back and regret it’ if they did not use the embryo glue.On another occasion they received an information sheet which claimed that research showed an endometrial scratch boosted the odds of IVF resulting in a birth by up to 70 per cent. ‘Those are big claims and you’re not going to dismiss that so we bought the add-on,’ she said.        ROBERT WINSTON: Doctors MUST stop cashing in on desperation of infertile couples seeking to have a childBy Robert Winston, one of the UK\u0027s top fertility expertsThe desperation and vulnerability of infertile couples leads them to grasp at straws. There are many causes for infertility and just as there are different causes, so there should be different treatments.Each couple requires the most suitable, cost-effective and safe treatment depending on the cause for their failure to conceive. Increasingly, they are offered the treatment most convenient to the doctor.IVF – the most complex, expensive and demanding of all infertility therapies – is seen as the standard procedure. It is the treatment suggested before the specific cause of the infertility is investigated.          IVF clinical fertility expert Robert Winston, above, writes: \u0027While the desperation of vulnerable patients is a fertile commercial opportunity, it may not improve their chance of a baby\u0027There is no other medical therapy where treatment is offered before proper attempts at diagnosis are made. Such practice is seen as highly unethical and is likely to be found legally negligent.To make matters worse, because each cycle of IVF has such a high failure rate, there are many empty-handed women left distressed after their IVF has failed. They often find themselves confronted by a doctor trying to consider how their IVF treatment might be improved.Without the underlying cause of failure properly established, they are encouraged to buy one of many add-on treatments which mostly have little or no serious evidence for their effectiveness.Nearly all, for different reasons, add substantially to the costs that a couple has already incurred.  \u0027Looking to transfer before Christmas\u0027: Brooklyn actress,...Thousands of young women battling cancer given fresh...Share this articleInitial reports from Israel suggested improved pregnancy rates, for reasons which are still unclear. More recently, Israeli scientists published conclusions suggesting no benefit. Now, 25 years since scratching was introduced, scientists from Utrecht in the Netherlands have initiated a huge randomised trial.So far, the evidence is dubious. Yet, according to a recent publication, up to 83 per cent of patients in New Zealand, Australia and the UK are advised to have the scratch.Embryo glue is also advocated by some clinics to help the embryo stick to the uterus after it is transferred. It involves dipping the embryo into a special fluid which may interact with the womb lining – and some clinics in London only charge £250 for it. The problem is that it probably doesn’t work and there are no definitive randomised trials which show otherwise.There are also a variety of complex treatments offered which are meant to change a patient’s immune system so an embryo is less likely to be rejected after transfer.The treatments add several hundred pounds at least to the cost of IVF. There are expensive tests on ‘killer cells’ in blood taken from the patient’s arm, but it is doubtful whether this gives seriously useful information about what is happening in the uterus.

Its UK operations are run by Cygnet Healthcare, whose best-paid director earned £508,000, a healthy £162,000 rise on the previous yearThe revelations led Mr Hancock to order an urgent inquiry into the use of segregation and long-term seclusion. The Equality and Human Rights Commission warned the NHS could face a formal investigation for human rights abuses of vulnerable people. Now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that firms in this sector include:An American healthcare giant whose boss earned £39.5 million in one year, despite his firm facing allegations of fraud and ‘preying’ on vulnerable people to boost profits in secure unitsAnother huge US firm that handed five executives almost £15 million last year and has been snapping up British operators, including the Priory Group, famous for also treating celebritiesA controversial British company that paid one director more than £1 million over two years despite claims that their staff failed to stop patients self-harming, with one patient later dying, and allegations of a sex assault in a hospitalGroups controlling firms that run a secure unit in Norfolk which are owned by two families who pocketed £2,261,782 in pay and idends over the past yearAnother British firm, backed by private equity and formed only 23 months ago, which runs 55 units and turns over £176 million, with 31.4 per cent profit marginsA charity that is Britain’s biggest provider of specialist psychiatric care that gave its departed chief executive nearly £1 million over the past two years, despite being at the centre of claims that it fed teenagers in solitary confinement through hatches.Angry families complain their children are seen as ‘cash cows’ and are milked by private providers that can charge the NHS more than £14,000 a week and whose own staff help make decisions on sectioning people under mental health laws.‘It’s an outrage given the numerous cases of neglect, abuse and deaths of vulnerable people in their care,’ said Isabelle Garnett, an autism activist whose teenage son suffered badly during two years detained in secure units.This newspaper has revealed families are having teenagers and young adults with autism and learning disabilities taken away and stuck in supposedly short-stay ATUs and secure units for many years.    £1,059,000 given over two years to the highest-paid director at Huntercombe. The chief executive is Valerie Michie, above. Huntercombe is owned by a Guernsey hedge fund and provides 91 beds for people with autism and learning disabilitiesDarren Slater, who has autism and learning disabilities, has been held for 17 years, despite having his own house bought with NHS compensation for a birth mistake. ‘There is a lot of money being made out of all this,’ said his father Brian.Another mother said she was forced to feed sweets to her teenage son with autism through metal bars after seeing him transported between secure units in a cage in a van. ‘I was so angry but so powerless,’ said Julie Newcombe, whose son is now free. She set up Rightful Lives with others to expose human rights abuses. ‘How can the Government waste millions imprisoning children and tell families there is no money for support at home?‘There is a huge conflict of interest within the private sector because heads on beds equals money in the bank, which means profit becomes the ultimate barrier to discharge.’The NHS spent £477.4 million in 2016 on people with autism and learning disabilities just in ATUs, which are meant to assess and treat psychiatric needs, rather than resolve care shortfalls. Instead, people are becoming trapped, often from adolescence, in an abusive, medicated and stressful system that can make conditions worse.                             The NHS spent £477.4 million in 2016 on people with autism and learning disabilities just in ATUs, which are meant to assess and treat psychiatric needs, rather than resolve care shortfalls                        Ministers have promised repeatedly since the 2011 Winterbourne View abuse scandal to move such people out of unsuitable secure units and into community care. Many units rely on carers paid only marginally above minimum wage levels. Yet the number of adults with autism and learning disabilities locked up in ATUs fell only slightly over the past three years, while the number of children more than doubled. Last year, there were 28,880 restraint incidents in England alone.One reliable source confirmed he had seen confidential data showing a health body paying average rates in 2016 of £2,007 per person a day.Over the past decade, the proportion in privately-run beds has soared from one-fifth to more than half, as new players such as Acadia, a Tennessee-based healthcare group, moved into the profitable trade in vulnerable people.Acadia spent £1.3 billion on the Priory Group two years ago. It now has 61 hospitals in Britain – ten holding people with autism and learning disabilities in secure units and three ATUs – among its 586 facilities and 18,000 psychiatric beds worldwide. Chief executive Joey Jacobs was reported to have earned £7.5 million last year alone in salary, bonuses and stock.One mother I spoke to was close to tears over treatment of her child in a Welsh unit run by Priory. ‘I’m fighting for her life,’ said Gillian Mead, whose daughter Lee, 43, was sectioned for the first time in April and claims to have been often restrained. ‘Lee has lost about five stone, and says “I want to come home” all the time. It’s awful.’          £362,000 collected by the highest-paid director at sector newcomers Elysium Healthcare last year. The chief executive is Joy Chamberlain, above. Elysium is backed by BC Partners, a private equity group, through low-tax Luxembourg, and operates in 55 UK locationsLast year, the Priory Group made £62.2 million profit, with most revenues funded by taxpayers. It handed one director £243,000 in remuneration. ‘The number of people with learning disabilities and autism placed in our secure hospitals by NHS England amounts to just two per cent of Priory Group beds and this number is falling,’ said a spokesman. He added that patient safety and family engagement were a priority and that all units were subject to regular official inspections.Universal Health Services is another huge US healthcare firm snapping up British psychiatric services. In June, it bought the Danshell Group, specialising in autism and learning disabilities at its 25 facilities. Universal’s founder is Alan Miller, reportedly the richest chief executive in the hospital industry – in 2016 he collected more than £39 million in pay, bonuses and stock. Yet in 2016, a year-long Buzzfeed investigation in nine US states accused the firm of pressuring staff to fill beds in hospitals for financial gain, even by falsely making patients appear suicidal.The claims were strongly disputed by the firm.Its British operations are run by Cygnet Healthcare, which boasted in recent accounts of earning revenues from 220 NHS purchasing bodies – a rise of 44 in a year – and almost doubling income as profits surged to £40.4 million.The fast-expanding firm gave its highest paid director a £508,000 pay package, a £162,000 increase on the previous year. Yet at one unit, staff injected patients in face-down restraints with medication, against official guidance. A secure unit in Woking was put in special measures after 24 serious incidents in a children’s ward, including sexual assault and staff failures to stop ‘significant’ self-harm including cutting and ligature-tying.          £2,262,000 pay and idends collected last year by two families from groups owning firms running a secure unit in Norfolk, and headed by chief executive Tugay Akman, above. The father of one man with autism there claims his son often sleeps 15 hours a day due to over-sedationA Cygnet spokesman said the Woking unit was now judged ‘good’ with safe care, while the firm was making ‘significant investments’ to ensure people with autism were treated in non-hospital environments if possible.British firms include Huntercombe, which ran the ATU – since closed – in which one young woman was fed so much in seclusion that she died from obesity in 2013. The firm handed its highest-paid director £1,059,000 over the past two years – it is not known if this is chief executive Valerie Michie.Huntercombe runs ten hospitals, of which three units with 91 beds focus on patients with autism and learning disabilities.An inspection earlier this year into one of them, the 40-bed Cedar House in Kent, found services and safety ‘required improvement’. Serious incidents registered included three cases of patients swallowing batteries, two other cases of self-harm and an allegation of sexual assault, plus use of ‘heavily soiled’ bed linen. One man also died in hospital after sticking batteries up his nose.          Tony Hickmott has been locked up for almost 18 years at Cedar House, a 40-bed secure unit near Canterbury owned by Huntercombe                                                    "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/10/00/04E87C1E000005DC-0-image-a-76_1541811197045.jpg","title":"FTSE100 chief execs called Dave Steve outnumber women run Britains businesses","story":"Daves and women were actually level pegging until last week when the housebuilder Persimmon announced its chief executive, Jeff Fairburn was being temporarily replaced by managing director Dave Jenkinson (left).  Right, Tesco boss Dave Lewis      Stephen Hester of RSA Insurance Group and, right, Stephen Carter, boss at Informa          There are just six female chief executives in the 100 firms, compared to seven men called Steve or Stephen and seven Daves or Davids.

It\u0027s crucial now for parliament to vote down this plan, because it is the biggest giveaway of sovereignty in modern times. \u0027Instead, the government and parliament must recognise we should give people a final say on Brexit. Only they can break the deadlock and choose from the practical options for Britain\u0027s future now on the table.\u0027Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer, however, vowed Labour would work with any willing MPs to prevent a no-deal outcome.

On Friday the DUP vowed to torpedo the government if Mrs May bows to EU demands on the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027. Pictured: DUP leader Arlene FosterA senior cabinet minister was quoted in the paper as saying: \u0027This is the moment she has to face down Brussels and make it clear to them that they need to compromise, or we will leave without a deal.\u0027An EU diplomat said earlier on Saturday that they were cautiously hopeful that an EU summit could happen in November to endorse the deal but that the volatile situation in Britain made it very difficult to predict.Other EU diplomats said several issues remained unresolved.Mrs May is expected to meet with her cabinet this week to set out her plans for the orce deal. She was dealt a blow on Friday when junior minister Jo Johnston, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, quit over her plan.To add to the pressure, a leading member of a group of Brexiteer lawmakers in parliament joined with the Brexit spokesman for the small Northern Irish party that props up May\u0027s party in government to warn that they could not vote for the deal as it currently stands. A spokeswoman for Mrs May\u0027s Downing Street office said the talks were going down to the wire. \u0027The prime minister has always said these negotiations are tough and toughest in the final stages.\u0027The prime minister has told colleagues this week we should aim to conclude the withdrawal agreement as soon as possible but we will not do that at any cost.\u0027 On Friday the DUP, whose ten MPs prop up Mrs May\u0027s government, vowed to torpedo the government if she bows to EU demands on the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027.      Jo and his sister Rachel were remainers while older brother Boris campaigned for BrexitThe party\u0027s leader, Arlene Foster, urged Mrs May to reflect on her Brexit stance as she warned the DUP will oppose her current proposals if they go to a parliamentary vote.She said \u0027no unionist\u0027 could back the apparent advocacy of a withdrawal treaty that includes a Northern Ireland specific backstop measure to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.In a letter to the DUP, which was leaked to the media, Mrs May insisted such a backstop would never come into force.Mrs Foster said her party was fundamentally opposed to any orce deal that saw Northern Ireland operate under a different regulatory arrangement to the rest of the UK.Stormont\u0027s former first minister insisted there were \u0027many others\u0027 in the Conservative Party who could also not support the Prime Minister\u0027s proposals.\u0027We would not be able to support this if it came to Parliament in the form that it is in the letter,\u0027 the DUP leader said.  Give the EU £20bn to leave as friends, says Jacob Rees-Mogg writing for Mail on Sunday  Jo Johnson\u0027s resignation is the \u0027Emperor\u0027s New Clothes\u0027 moment in the Brexit process. He has stated clearly what everybody knows: that the negotiations satisfy no one and that we are hurtling towards making the UK a vassal state.Theresa May will understandably be dismayed by his resignation and by new reports that, in any case, there can be no progress this week for her preferred Chequers solution as Brussels will not accept it.However, it is time for the Prime Minister to be true to her mantra that \u0027no deal is better than a bad deal\u0027. It is also time for convinced Brexiteers like me to compromise.So at this late hour in the negotiations, we would like to make a new, generous offer to break the deadlock, to achieve a \u0027No Deal Plus\u0027.It would cost us money but it would finally dispel the \u0027crash out\u0027 Project Fear nightmare scenarios.It is true that with no withdrawal agreement at all, we legally owe the EU nothing – despite misguided claims from the Chancellor that we do.          It is time for the Prime Minister to be true to her mantra that \u0027no deal is better than a bad deal\u0027But we should offer Brussels £20 billion to make our departure as amicable as possible.Under it, we would leave on schedule on March 29.However, for a 21-month transition period until the end of 2020, both sides would maintain a standstill with zero tariffs on either\u0027s goods and no additional barriers.This would be until the end of the EU\u0027s current multi-annual financial framework.In return, the UK would continue to make payments to the EU budget which are just under £10 billion a year, net. In total, that is half what the Government is currently prepared to pay for a deal. We would continue to apply existing EU rules and the Common Commercial Policy until the end of 2020. This would provide both sides with time to prepare for a departure on to World Trade Organisation terms, or for the activation of the comprehensive free trade deal that the EU has offered.The UK would be a third country, which would simplify the negotiations.It would be a generous offer from the UK especially as it would be combined with the protection of the rights of nationals from EU member states legally living in the UK.Justine Greening says Theresa May is ‘handing power to EU’ in Brexit deal | Politics | The GuardianTheresa May\u0027s Brexit plan set to be blocked by Tory backbenchersKeir Starmer: Labour will join Tory MPs to block no‑deal Brexit | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Harvey Weinsteins lawyers say chances freedom boosted accuser changes story","story":"    French actress Léa Seydoux, 33, (pictured with Daniel Craig) played Dr Madeleine Swann in 2015’s 007 film Spectre.

They have tremendous loyalty to both parents and learn early on to navigate between the two camps.They hate to hear their parents slagging off each other and generally decide that total discretion is the wisest modus vivendi – rarely telling one parent anything about their time with the other.I remember freaking out when I learnt, through a third party, that my son Sam, then six years old, had slept in his father’s Majorcan bar during his stay with him. But Sam never mentioned it to me, nor seemed particularly put out when I raised the topic.Children are very accepting of each parent’s character and, as they grow up, instinctively understand their respective strengths and weaknesses.There have been countless times when, annoyed as I may have been with my ex, I have known that he would have a better take than me on one of our child’s worries. At moments like this, shared responsibility is a relief.Divorced parenting is never easy but the best thing you can do for your kids is to try to ensure they have an equally strong relationship with both parents.

Now, at 83, she talks about cruel fables and the medicinal joy of champagneThere’s a moment in old age when some people become a little girl again, and it’s at this point in her life that I meet Dame Paula Rego, the 83-year-old artist who has always been fascinated by fairytales. “There’s a traditional Portuguese folk tale where a very poor couple have run out of food.” This is her favourite. “The children are crying so the wife cuts off her breast and cooks it for supper. The next day she cuts off her other breast. But on the third day she explains to her husband that there’s nothing left to eat, and he says, ‘We’ll have to start on the children.’” She likes it because it’s “ruthless and terrible,” which are also words that have been used to describe her work, along with comical and visceral and grotesque. She sits, slowly. “I’m very, very old. But I’m an idiot. I feel very young. How old do I feel?” She thinks for a second, her eyes slightly glazed. She smiles constantly. “Eight,” she settles on, firmly.Paula Rego, who was born into a privileged family in Portugal during a dictatorship (though she was “being repressed and restrained by my mother, not Salazar”), began exhibiting with the London Group in the 1960s alongside David Hockney. She became the first associate artist at the National Gallery and today is one of our greatest living painters. Her themes are power and possession, childhood, and sexual transgression in The Policeman’s Daughter (1987), a girl polishes her absent father’s jackboot, her fist rammed in deep. She offers me some ginger tea.The light in her Camden Town studio is warm and dramatic, and falls in angles on rails of antique dresses, a stuffed octopus and a mannequin of a naked child, begging. These are props that have appeared in her paintings over the past 50 years, details in a career that has reflected a life equal parts charmed and painful. And, this is not a comfortable interview. Not because of what Rego says – she is welcoming and delightful – but because of what seems to have been lost, and recently, too.Interviewing somebody who has become very old very quickly feels both important – gather what you can before it’s too late – and exploitative, and afterwards I take the long way back to work to shake off my discomfort. Folded into her chair, she searches for the correct answers, but when they appear they’re well-worn, photocopies.Their relationship has never been easy. His sister Victoria says the children were, “very much the subplot” to Rego’s life. She kept her son at arm’s length, and “regularly excluded me because I was a man and wouldn’t get it. So to finally have her open up to me,” he says, “made me feel loved.”In 2007, during a particularly bad depression, she did a series of pictures which she locked in a drawer. They were of Lila, standing in for Rego, holding tightly on to “things that do not help”. Though they were cathartic to draw she was ashamed of them, and refused to show them for 10 years, but today her depression is as much a part of her story as the anecdote about how she met her late husband, the artist Victor Willing.She was studying at the Slade under Lucian Freud (her parents banned her from going to Chelsea School of Art when they heard about another student getting pregnant) when Vic took her into a room at a party and told her to remove her knickers. Many abortions later, when, aged 20, she decided to have a baby, he finally left his wife. Remembering Vic, she says: “Grief is always there, it doesn’t get easier. I thought about falling in love again many times, but that’s nobody’s business.”Abortion, or the promise of it, is another of Rego’s motifs. The aim of her 1998 Abortion series was to campaign for a change in Portuguese law – when they were exhibited, the gallery was full of women whispering.There is another fairytale Rego likes to tell, about a woman given a magic cake that will make her pregnant. Except, scared it is poisoned, she passes it to her husband, who gives birth to a daughter. “I like the idea of the man having the baby and his gut bursting,” Rego says. “Serves him right.”The horror of her work, unfashionable for so long due to its painterly naturalism, seems appropriate now, as truths about the female experience are being peeled back, and a return to figurative painting has seen artists use the body to discuss, among other things, the sexist politics of art.“Paula Rego’s art has come in and out of focus several times since the early 90s,” says art critic Laura Cumming. “Familiarity may have blotted out her achievements for a while. She was sometimes thought to be a kind of honorary godmother to the YBAs, but in fact her dark and knotted scenarios have almost nothing in common with their eye-popping shockery.”In her work women are strong but compliant, and they are ostriches, and they are children, scavenging for food, opening their dress to be shot. “Painting pictures is the part of you that’s a man,” Rego told her son. “It has the push, the thrust. Having babies and playing at house is… play acting. While doing a picture you are being yourself.”Every morning, Lila picks Rego up from her Hampstead home. “I live by the Heath, unfortunately,” she sniffs. “I don’t like nature. I like hotels. Trees are ever so difficult to draw – much more so than a hand.” She sips her tea. “Then we put on opera and draw until lunchtime, when I have a rest.” There is a bed built on a curtained platform near the door, overlooking the naked child and stuffed donkey. Once, visiting the studio, Charles Saatchi saw a model Rego had commissioned her son-in-law to make for her painting of Pinocchio, thus discovering Ron Mueck – the artist’s work appeared in the Sensation exhibition the following year.For all the tensions, Rego’s is a family business – on weekends, sometimes her grandchildren will sit for her. “I drew Lola as the Virgin Mary. She was 14, the age Mary was when she had Jesus – very young, isn’t it? No, they don’t know I’m a ‘great artist’. I’m Grandma.”After her rest, Lila will change the music to fado, and she will work, or try to. “But,” she groans, “I have no story right now. I’m a bit dead down there – nothing’s coming. I’m no good. It’s not always easy.” What makes it easier? “Lots of champagne.” At home, every night, she watches a film, having recently given up EastEnders. “Even a bad movie is better than no movie. I save my glass of champagne to drink while watching the film. Then I go to bed and hope not to have too many nightmares.” In 1965, she said her work was about, “giving fear a face.” As a child she was scared of everything as an adult she is scared of most things. “The devil, particularly. I saw him when I was… eight. Every Saturday at Fascist Youth they’d say: ‘Never look into a fire, you will see the face of the devil.’ And one night I heard footsteps, the door opened, and death came in. I ran into my parents’ room, but death came with me. So I remained afraid. Today, I still have bad dreams, but think less about death.” She pauses, smiling. “It’s not very nice to live inside my mind. I’d like not to have these dreams every night. I bought a dreamcatcher, but it does nothing to help. The only thing that does, is the work.” Does she ever think about retiring? “No. What would I do? Some drawing I suppose.”She walks to a chair the photographer has positioned in a vast triangle of light and closes her eyes while he focuses the lens. “Stay just like that,” he says, “perfect.” Willing, who started working with his mother when her Lisbon museum was under threat, stands to help her walk. He says old age has affected her work, but not stalled it. “She’s turning that into pictures, too. The fragility of her line, boldness of colour, directness of the image are reflections of her age, her state of mind. But while her pictures remain powerful, for me personally, I see the giant who makes them losing her strength and becoming scared.” Four clicks later the photographer tells Rego she can open her eyes, and we wait, but her eyes stay closed. There is an uneasy pause. Lila clears her throat. The photographer says it again, louder, and then again, and Rego starts awake. “Were you having a lovely dream Paula?” he smiles. “Yes?” she blinks, unsure.The Cruel Stories of Paula Rego runs until 14 January 2019 at Musée de l’Orangerie, Paris"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e61807e6d159cb0f5fb89e39795326d4287da03/17_1102_1747_1048/master/1747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2161c25b23a9b18a1ee7ac1bf7078ec3","title":"japanese kabuki prints in pictures","story":"Kabuki is a form of traditional Japanese theatre that was hugely popular from the 1600s to the 1800s.

Tim Clark, head of the British Museum’s Japanese section, has just acquired 359 of these prints that will go on display at the museum’s Mitsubishi Corporation Japanese galleries next year. “The prints served as a memento for fans of how a particular actor interpreted a particular role,” he says. “Each design was sold at an affordable price – proverbially, ‘for a bit more than a double helping of noodles’.” For Clark, they’re an amazing glimpse into the past. “They still transmit the energy and beauty of performances from 200 years ago.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/592ce5f31a54c7a965e1e0039ac2142f618484ae/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79207d143c4042539eee03cfe62b258d","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The migrant caravan in Mexico, wildfires in California, another fatal suspected stabbing in London, protests in Gaza and the US midterms 2018 – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baa6cfd00ebe7fcf1cc017af3864dffdc5c6e064/0_128_5405_3244/master/5405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af258bb09ab0d45fe73519e37f9ebca6","title":"jobs lost retailers high street decline","story":"New figures reveal surge in the number of businesses going into administration or closing stores as costs rise and shoppers move onlineUp to 85,000 retail jobs disappeared from Britain’s high streets in the first nine months of this year after a surge in the number of businesses going bust and closing stores.The figures raise further fears about the future of Britain’s high streets, where the number of premises lying empty soared by more than 4,400 in the first six months of 2018, according to retail analysis firm Local Data Company.Retailers are under pressure as shoppers buy more goods online, and the cost of running high-street premises is being hit by rises in business rates and the legal minimum wage. The cost of building new warehouse, transport and IT infrastructure to support home deliveries is also biting, just as consumers rein in spending amid uncertainty over Brexit and minimal real wage growth.According to the Office for National Statistics, 80,000 retail jobs were lost in the first half of this year, with losses now believed to be up to 85,000. Rachel Lund head of insights at the British Retail Consortium said: “We are seeing more competition and higher costs on the high street, coupled with a long-term decline in footfall as consumers shop online. This is making conditions tough for retailers, so it is no surprise that job numbers have fallen alongside a rise in CVAs and insolvencies.” The government should take immediate action to halt the rising cost of business rates.”With rates due to rise again in April, she said ministers “should plan for a wholesale reform of our broken business rate system”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4707b03c9ec553b6fcebacac40cd8bd7335b0b27/0_196_5184_3111/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d876cc578daffd38e4ff2e2f39fbab7","title":"84 per cent of grooming gangs are asians we dont know if that figure is right","story":"Bickering over a disputed report shows how little we know about the perpetratorsFew debates about academic methodology result in a researcher being labelled a “posh socialist ‘activdemic’” or another being told that her work is akin to a BNP leaflet. But this is no ordinary academic debate. It’s about Asian “grooming gangs” and a report on the issue published last year by the anti-extremism thinktank the Quilliam Foundation.Thanks to a series of high-profile court cases, the question of Asian and, specifically, Muslim grooming gangs has become an incendiary issue. Quilliam and its chairman, Maajid Nawaz, ide opinion. For some, they are a scourge on political correctness, bravely shining a light on dark corners of Muslim communities. For others, they give succour to bigots.The report faced fierce criticism from academic researchers. Ella Cockbain, a lecturer in security and crime science, is an expert on child sexual exploitation. She said it “is a case study in bad science: riddled with errors, inconsistencies, a glaring lack of transparency, sweeping claims and gross generalisations unfounded its own ‘data’”.The latest controversy began with a celebrity. Lily Allen tweeted that the report had been “outed as being utterly useless”. Cockbain backed her up, calling it “utter rubbish”. Nawaz denounced both as “Disgusting #RegressiveLeft neo-colonial hypocrites”. And so it went on.Beyond the inflammatory rhetoric, what are the facts? Surprisingly few. Certainly, the media have highlighted many cases involving Asian men grooming girls, often white, for sexual exploitation. Media coverage is, however, a poor gauge of facts.Nazir Afzal is the Crown Prosecution Service’s former lead on child sexual abuse and the prosecutor most responsible for bringing down grooming gangs. The media, he observes, pounce on cases involving Asians, but often ignore those involving white perpetrators.“Grooming gang” is not a legal category. Group-based child sexual exploitation (CSE) falls under a range of offences, from rape to conspiracy to incite prostitution. In only some cases, often when non-whites are involved, is ethnicity recorded. All this makes it difficult to ascertain the facts and behoves us to be cautious.Critics have pointed out, however, that even a casual media search produces far more white perpetrators of group CSE who seem to have been ignored by Adil and Rafiq. And 58 cases over a period of 12 years seems exceptionally low. As the Quilliam report itself notes, a Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) study found 57 cases of Type 1 offending (in Quilliam’s eyes, the equivalent of grooming gangs) in 2012 alone. Rafiq told me he was unsure about the reasons for the disparity but that it may be a difference between grooming cases and court convictions.In 2012, Cockbain called the CEOP figures “striking”. Today, she is more cautious. “It is enormously difficult to separate out group and lone offences from large-scale national datasets,” she argues. Without a proper definition of what “distinguishes ‘grooming gang’ activity from other forms of child sexual abuse, it simply isn’t possible to measure the scale or characteristics of offenders”. Quilliam researchers disagree, but have produced no methodology to assuage the concerns.Equally contentious is the question of why Asians may offend. The Quilliam report blames the “culture” of Muslim communities. Those who deny this are being “politically correct”.No one could accuse Afzal of political correctness. He has pushed through prosecutions of Asian offenders, often in the face of considerable resistance. The issue, he argues, is less about culture or religion than opportunity and circumstance. In many small towns, Asians control the night-time economy – working in takeaways or driving minicabs. Just as church schools or football clubs provided opportunities for certain types of men to commit sexual offences, so do such night economies.The cases of grooming gangs, the role of Asians, and of Muslims, and the failure of the authorities to take the issue seriously, raise important and complex questions. The manner in which the issue has been debated, however, has been abysmal.There is an assumption of bad faith. Cockbain has implied that Quilliam’s argument is driven by a desire for funding. One of her detractors hinted darkly (and without providing any justification) that her motivation is “other than academic”.There is guilt by association. The fact that the far right has made use of the Quilliam report is seen by some as tainting it. A Quilliam source suggested that Cockbain’s criticisms were damned by the fact that “jihadists gleefully egg her on”.There is nothing racist about asking whether Asians or Muslims may be disproportionately represented in any form of crime. That doesn’t mean that any investigation or claim should be uncritically accepted. There is equally nothing racist about white researchers calling out the work of non-whites as shoddy.These are terrible crimes. There needs to be a proper public debate. The victims, indeed all of us, deserve better than this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d227ad6319e5d898469c45c8a0dbb8f68e37b9/0_128_3760_2256/master/3760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=457bdc5a15672502ad505ba0593a3eaa","title":"the lowdown on british columbia this canadian province is not to be missed","story":"With cosmopolitan cities nudging wide-open wilderness, spectacular wildlife and a superb culinary scene, British Columbia offers a host of amazing adventuresChefs around the world adore BC for its incredible produce, from sweet spot prawns, celebrated in a festival each year at Vancouver’s Fisherman’s Wharf, to the juicy Okanagan cherries and peaches, which locals devour by the crate.Start planning your trip by poring over online menus at stellar Vancouver restaurants such as chef Andrea Carlson’s Burdock \u0026amp Co Gastown go-to, French-influenced L’Abattoir or the upmarket west coast take at Botanist.

Check out kitsch memorabilia, clothing with Chinese motifs, and Hong Kong-made backpacks In the narrow, lantern-filled streets of Central and Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) – under looming mirrored skyscrapers and a hot tropical sun – Hong Kong becomes a city dedicated to eating and shopping. Visitors on a consumption high lurch from buzzing dim sum restaurants to bustling markets, gorging on truffle wontons and debating exactly how often they’d use a 10-part porcelain tea set back home. Of the hundreds of Cantonese restaurants, aromatic medicine shops and colourful boutiques stocked with local goods that line the city’s streets, the following examples in particular capture the essence of Hong Kong with aplomb.Ho Lee Fook Directly translating as “good fortune in your mouth” in English, the name of this colourful Cantonese restaurant sounds a lot like the exclamation diners make after tasting the tender roast wagyu short ribs with soy glaze, the Taiwanese chicken or the threadfin fish with Jamaican-Chinese jerk rub. The Hong Kong theme is strong throughout – think a giant shimmering bronze dragon covering one wall, while the steps leading down to the restaurant are lined with hundreds of golden toy cats raising a single paw in salute. It’s no reservations, so avoid prime time – or factor in a few strong cocktails at the bar while you wait.Jimmy’s KitchenIf only walls could talk. Jimmy’s Kitchen has been around since 1928 and has been serving western food to celebrities, politicians and particularly homesick expats for nearly a century. Today, this icon from the colonial era is packed every night with locals who come to immerse themselves in the nostalgic decor and delightfully old-fashioned attitude to food. Popular with megastars like Cary Grant and John Wayne back in the day, its menu has barely been updated since the 1950s – think steak and kidney pie and baked pork knuckle. And it is hard to imagine anywhere else in Asia where you can wallow in the past and order a steak diane, a baked alaska and white Russian for dinner.Goods of Desire With quirky bed linen, novelty stationery and posters big enough to jazz up entire rooms, Goods of Desire has been the go-to store for cool furniture and lifestyle items with a Hong Kong sense of humour since the days of the British. Launched by two architects aiming to repackage Hong Kong heritage brands into kitsch furniture, fun fashion, and quirky art for the younger generation, it has also been deliberately provocative over the years, with a number of slogans aimed at the city’s notorious Triad gangs.

The practice has made its way to the high street after celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Victoria Beckham were photographed in the same outfits as their offspring.Primark experienced a surge in sales of its matching adult and mini-me clothes after Beyoncé shared an image of herself wearing the same Gucci dress as her six-year-old daughter Blue Ivy. While the singer’s choice cost about £3,000, Primark’s options are a more modest £30 one of its most popular items is an all-generations denim jacket.

At Jean Paul Gaultier’s couture presentation this year, the model Coco Rocha appeared with her two-year-old, Ioni, wearing an identical ice-blue creation, while at Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana’s recent Milan show, models appeared hand-in-hand with children in matching pyjama-style ensembles.As to why family members would want to dress the same, Carolyn Mair, author of The Psychology of Fashion, said it generated a sense of belonging. “It makes a positive statement about the family to observers, as it’s doubtful that a family or couple who were not in a good place emotionally would dress the same,” she said. “Wanting to show that we have shared meaning with another can be uniting. When we dress the same we can begin to think and behave the same.”While matchy-matchy dressing may seem to contradict iniduality, which is celebrated more than ever, Mair said the two forms of expression share a common thread. “Both show strength, but in different ways.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa856ae46da48f0e9a0904d037bbc59c573b6b8e/0_131_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fe25f1cb8672e8cfa6af05b7f86f903","title":"cypriot farmers halloumi shortage milk global demand china","story":"Shortage of sheep and goats in Cyprus coupled with growing taste for grilled cheese in China ‘threatens global supplies’It’s on restaurant menus from London to New York and has become a barbecue favourite far and wide.But, on the Mediterranean island where it has been made since medieval times, halloumi’s unprecedented global popularity has also begun to cause concern. Fears are being voiced that local dairy farmers soon won’t be able to keep up with demand.Last week, the Cypriot government signed a protocol allowing the export of dairy products to China, where the middle classes have reputedly developed a taste for the rubbery cheese. And, far from being jubilant at the prospect of a new booming market, producers were worried.“It’s difficult enough servicing demand in the UK, Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Australia,” says Alexis Pantziaros speaking from his dairy farm outside Larnaka. “If the Chinese learn about it too, it will become impossible to keep up.”He is far from being alone. As Australia prepares to host the world’s first halloumi festival in Melbourne next weekend, and the cheese flies off supermarket shelves across Europe, others in the industry including distributors and sellers are wondering if halloumi’s spectacular success has gone too far.“Not all of us have sheep and goats, and to meet standards you need them to make it,” says Andreas Andreou director of the industry department at Cyprus’s chamber of commerce. “It’s only logical that if we go on like this there won’t be enough to go round.”Pantziaros goes further. “There just isn’t enough milk,” says the farmer, conceding that he has been forced to import sheep from Italy and Denmark. “In summer, when temperatures get up to 42C, the animals produce very little. It’s very difficult to get them pregnant. In such heat they don’t even want to eat!”Already there have been jitters. This summer, news of supermarket shortages in the UK spurred a social-media storm with the mayhem compelling one producer to send “emergency supplies” by road to avoid delays inevitably encumbered by shipping – despite subsequent denials that stocks had run out.Outside Cyprus, Britain remains the second biggest consumer of the cheese, whose barbecue friendliness has made it a favourite among vegetarians as well as meat-eaters.As grillable as it is fryable, halloumi, once a humble staple of the Cypriot diet, has morphed from being a salad topping – its initial use when first exported abroad – into burgers, fries and sandwich fillers because of its unmeltable ability to withstand being cooked over coals and remain intact.McDonald’s, Nando’s and Burger King are among the chains that have added it to their menus.Stelios Angelodemou, who had the idea to bring halloumi lovers together with the Melbourne festival, predicts that soon every restaurant will be selling halloumi.“When it comes to cheese, halloumi is a star,” the Cypriot community leader told the Melbourne Greek-newspaper Neos Kosmos.“It’s a great cheese, so tasty, and the only cheese you can place on top of a flame that won’t burn or melt that makes it special.”But what makes halloumi special also makes it dangerously attractive. Impostors abound. In Germany and the UK, dairy farmers have tried to produce their own version of the cheese using only cow’s milk.Such violations have forced the Cyprus government – which is again trying to register halloumi as a protected designation of origin product with the European Commission – to hire a watchdog of international scouts.“Halloumi is a very important national product for our island, historically, culturally and economically,” Nelly Koulia, director of trade at the ministry of commerce told the Observer. “It can only be produced in Cyprus by authorised users. Every time we are informed of an infringement through our watch service we take immediate action in collaboration with the Law Office of the Republic that can range from cease and desist letters to outright legal suits.”Last year, scientists at Edinburgh University said they would be helping Cypriot breeders to increase production of goat’s and sheep’s milk for halloumi. “All the signs are that this season is going to get off to a good start,” said Giorgos Petrou, another dairy farmer on the island. “When winter comes, our animals produce a lot more milk. We want to make halloumi lovers everywhere happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ac6379764ff3c727572157a0c052338de6fa3f5/0_292_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52573c475963b570ac237032ff0c0167","title":"how we lost our love milk alt","story":"Soya, almond, oat... Whether for health issues, animal welfare or the future of the planet, ‘alt-milks’ have never been more popular. Are we approaching dairy’s final days?A couple of weeks ago, some eye-catching billboards began appearing around central and east London. Entire tunnels of the underground were plastered with the adverts the sides of large buildings were covered. On one panel there was a carton (or, in some instances, three) of Oatly, an oat drink made by a cult Swedish company that favours stark graphics, a bluey-grey colour scheme, and which is a market leader – in a not uncompetitive field – in the tongue-in-cheek promotional messages known as “wackaging”. The adjacent panel, in large, wobbly type, read: “It’s like milk, but made for humans.”Around the same time, during commercial breaks on Channel 4’s 4oD, there appeared a 15-second clip of a man in a field of oats, playing a tinny 1980s synthesiser and howling: “Wow, no cow!” That guy is Toni Petersson, the 50-year-old CEO of Oatly, and the song, you would not be entirely surprised to learn, is his own composition. “Listen, it’s absolutely terrible, right?” says Petersson, over the phone from Eugene, Oregon. “My creative directors wanted to make some commercials that I was part of. One of them included a song that they wrote, which was even worse. I had no idea I thought it was going to be shown one time only.”Petersson, who previously worked in nightclubs and Costa Rican real estate, became Oatly CEO in 2012. So is he fearful of – or even hoping for – a similar battle in the UK now? “There might be some legal consequences, I don’t know,” he replies. “But am I concerned about it? No, I’m not. It’s just true!” Petersson laughs. “We actually have really, really good lawyers they really enjoy this too. I mean, who could argue with the fact: ‘It’s like milk, but made for humans?’ How can that be wrong?”Then there are people who have never much liked drinking milk, or who don’t buy the health claims that resolutely cling to it. Or maybe they just want to try something different. Oat drinks, which tend to taste quite neutral but still creamy, can often be a gateway for those thinking of converting. Oatly, in particular, dominates the market of specialist coffee shops, especially in Europe and the US. This summer, the New Yorker reported that New York was experiencing a critical shortage of Oatly, which began supplying a handful of coffee shops in the city in 2016 but expanded rapidly to more than 1,000 outlets nationwide. A litre of Oatly was selling for $20, five times the regular price.I suggest to Petersson that this might have been another publicity stunt: creating scarcity and fanning interest. “Oh, I wish it was,” he says. “I wish we were that clever.”Beyond oats, the options are almost overwhelming. Rude Health, Britain’s leading organic, dairy alternative brand, began selling drinks in 2013: it started with oat, brown rice and – almost as an afterthought – almond. This turned out to be a sound move Rude Health’s Almond Drink is its bestselling item in any category and it is estimated that two-thirds of the alt-milk sold in Britain is almond (one of the main drivers, apparently, was Gwyneth Paltrow, who extols its virtues in her recipes and on her wellbeing site Goop). Rude Health now makes 10 drinks, including exotic offerings such as hazelnut and calcao, and tiger nut, which is not actually a nut, but a tuber.Meanwhile, Innocent – the birthplace of “wackaging” (infantilised, overfamiliar packaging), and since 2013, owned by Coca-Cola – moved into dairy-free drinks earlier this year (its slogan: “You ain’t seen nuttin’ yet”). It has a range of four – almond, oat, hazelnut and coconut – and makes much of the fact that its almond and oat drinks only contain the named ingredient plus spring water and salt.Likewise, whereas once you might, if you were lucky, have found soya in a vegan-friendly cafe, now alt-milk has gone mainstream. Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee chain, has not failed to take note of the trends coming out of the smaller, third-wave coffee shops, where idiosyncratic requests are a point of pride for both customer and barista. It is rapidly supplementing its plant-based menu and now offers coconut, oat, almond and soya “milk”. It’s hard to measure the impact of Instagram – specifically “latte porn” – but everyone agrees it has been influential in spreading the word, especially with a younger crowd.Traditional, regular milk, probably derived from a cow, faces quite a battle then. But this is nothing new. Mark Kurlansky, who has previously written books on cod and salt, calls milk “the most argued-over food in human history”. There have been – and remain – impassioned debates over, among others, the benefits of breastfeeding, which animals we should and should not milk, the safety of “raw” milk, the health benefits of pasteurised. Many of these have been taking place for many thousands of years.“If you think about it, it’s not surprising people argue over it,” Kurlansky tells me. “What is it? It’s bodily fluid that mothers produce for their young. I’d have loved to have been there the first time there was this baby and either the mother had died or the mother wasn’t able to produce milk and they are all standing around saying, ‘What are we going to do? We’ve got to get milk for the baby.’ And somebody says, ‘What about that goat over there?’ I mean, what an extraordinary moment!”Bryans has seen Oatly’s new advertising campaign and, unsurprisingly, she’s not impressed. “What is fascinating, to me, is that plant-based drinks market themselves on dairy values,” she says. “If your product is really strong as a product in its own right, why do you need to market yourself on the basis of the virtues of another product that already exists? In terms of the idea about ‘milk, but made for humans’, I have a PhD in nutrition and people have been consuming milk and dairy products for millennia. They’ve been consuming them for a variety of reasons: for nutrition, for their versatility, for the taste, for the benefits they give.”Kurlansky, too, doesn’t entirely buy Oatly’s line. “Yeah, but who says humans are supposed to drink oats?” he says. “Now,” she adds, “you turn around the carton of that plant-based beverage and what you tend to have is a very small percentage of the plant, and then you have colourings, preservatives, additives, and usually fortification of vitamins and minerals that already exist naturally in milk.”For these reasons, Bryans thinks that alt-milks (which typically cost between £2 and £3.50 per litre) will be exactly what Oatly’s Petersson insists they are not: a fad. “You grow up with milk in your childhood, it’s your friend, when you’re expecting your own child, all through your adult life and into old age,” she says. “Alternative products are the trendy friend you go clubbing with but you break up with them really often. So you might flirt with one kind of plant-based drink, then another kind, but milk is the one that sticks with you throughout your life.”Part of the reason for this shift, unquestionably, is that many of us have lost faith that drinking milk is doing us good. Milk does contain calcium and vitamin D, but whether this leads to stronger bones, as our parents assured us, is controversial and contested by some recent studies. It’s packed with protein, which is essential for the growth and repair of the body, but in the UK, most people already consume more protein than they need.“There’s all these myths about milk being healthy,” says Kurlansky. “A lot of it isn’t true and a lot of people have been drinking milk, and not particularly liking it, because they thought that they should. And so now they realise they don’t have to and they are glad not to.”When I meet Nick and Camilla Barnard, the founders of Rude Health, at their HQ in west London, I expect them to talk down milk. Instead, strangely, they have something close to sympathy for it. And actually, they really like it – at least in its raw, unpasteurised form. Nick Barnard even reminisces fondly of winning the World Porridge-Making Championships in 2013, using raw Guernsey milk and cream from a dairy in Somerset that he had to “smuggle” into Scotland, because they are outlawed there.“Milk is an extraordinary, incredibly complex substance, but we’ve reduced it to red, blue or green,” says Camilla Barnard. “And the supermarkets fight over how low in price it can be. We’ve just pasteurised it, we’ve homogenised it, we’ve made it as cheap as possible – bang it out there. And then, surprise, surprise, we’ve gone off it. We lost all the value in it, which is really sad.”The Barnards believe alt-milks are thriving because they offer something different. “We just felt consumers were ill-served by choice,” says Nick Barnard. “So we came in with a pizzazz, we came in saying, ‘This tastes great! You can bake with it! You can make smoothies! You can make horchata!’ So all of a sudden, it was just more joyful. It’s not misery: ‘I can’t have milk.’ If you like almond, then have almond if you like gold top, and you’re not lactose intolerant, then have that. Celebrate ersity.”He agrees with the dairy lobby that it doesn’t make sense to directly compare milk and plant-based drinks. “At the end of the day, almonds and water have the nutritional value of almonds and water. The value of raw milk is that it’s a food” – that is, nourishing and sustaining on a deeper level. “Our work is to not encourage anxiety: ‘You must have this dairy-free, because dairy is going kill you!’ Or: ‘Cows are going to destroy the world.’ No! What you need to do is to say: ‘What suits me?’ And then: ‘Does it make me feel good?’”David and Wilma Finlay are dairy farmers with a medium-sized holding in Dumfries and Galloway, not far from the English border. They run the Ethical Dairy and are trying a new approach to cow’s milk. They have “110-ish” cows that are hybrids of three breeds designed to create a more robust, productive and long-living animal. “Our cows look like liquorice allsorts – they are all kinds of colours and shapes and sizes,” explains David Finlay. “There’s a lot of bonuses that come from crossing, but they don’t look so pretty.”For much of the past 25 years, the Finlays have been turning the milk from their cows into ice-cream, but they recently began to concentrate on making artisan, raw-milk cheese. But that’s not what is really radical about what they are doing. A couple of years ago, the Finlays started to wonder if they could make their farm work both as a business and an ethical enterprise that puts animal welfare at the heart of the operation. At the centre of the experiment was the idea to allow calves to stay with their mothers for five to six months after they are born. The cows are still milked during this period, but only once a day.Some background might be helpful. In most commercial dairies, calves are taken away from their mothers soon after birth organic farms are required to keep them together for a minimum of 24 hours. On the most intensive dairies, cows will be milked three times a day. In these industrial facilities many cows don’t survive to the age of five.The Finlays’ experiment began in October 2016 and David admits the first year did not go well. The farm was “haemorrhaging” money and the cows were discombobulated. “We were all stressed about when were they going to see the calves again,” he explains. “Every time we came into the parlour: were the calves going to be there? They didn’t know what the rules were any more. The rules had changed.”Finlay was ready to give up but his staff talked him round. He’s pleased they did: year two has just come to an end, the milk yield is back up and the cows are thriving. “OK, we’re still not profitable,” he says, “but we’re on our way to a profitable system.” One of the benefits of a less intensive system is there is much less pressure on the cows, so they in theory live longer. There’s evidence of this already on the Finlays’ farm, which converted to organic around 20 years ago: their oldest milking cow is nearly 18, and the average is around nine. Also, in recent years the Finlays have reduced the farm’s greenhouse-gas emissions by more than half, one of the least defensible aspects of dairy farming.Moreover, the public seems to like what the Ethical Dairy is doing. The Finlays recently launched a crowd-funding campaign to raise £50,000 with an aim to “revolutionise the dairy industry”: their hope was to share what they’ve learned and make ethical farming open source. They achieved their target with days to spare. “We listened to our customers and said, ‘OK, we’re going to give it a go, will you come with us?’” says David Finlay. “Because no one else in the industry is going to help, no one in government is going to help us. And it really is quite amazing how that has reverberated.”Is there a model here for the future of dairy farming? Would customers – even the younger generation – return to milk if they had a guarantee that everything had been done to make its production as ethical, sustainable and environmentally considerate as possible? That all efforts have been taken to make the end product as delicious as it can be? It’s difficult to predict if this could work on any scale: a few farms in the UK have a similar system to the Ethical Dairy, but it is by far the largest. And there is another problem: price. It’s often pointed out that milk now costs less than a bottle of water. Decades of industrialisation and commodification means that it’s hard to imagine supermarkets suddenly telling us that a pint of milk is now actually £2.Even David Finlay does not think that price rises are the answer. “It’s a very difficult one. People say, ‘Well, we’d be happy to pay 10p a litre more – that’s not a big issue for us.’ But you think, if the farmer was getting 10p a litre more, I know what would happen. My neighbour who has got 1,500 dairy cows, he’d put up a shed tomorrow with 500 more cows in it. Whereas your 100-cow guy couldn’t afford to put up a new diary premises for more cows. OK, he would benefit but almost immediately there would be too much milk in the market and the price would come down. So the price is only one factor in the whole food cycle.”More likely, in the future, we will see a more extreme version of what we have now. “With milk, as with almost all food, two separate markets are developing: rich, urban people and everybody else,” says Kurlansky. “It was actually a Welsh farmer who said to me, ‘The future of high-quality milk is in cities.’”Suddenly what you splash on your cereal in the morning or dash in your coffee has become very complicated. Regular milk is too commodified alt-milk is not nutritious enough raw milk, to use an often-quoted line, is like “playing Russian roulette” with your health. But, as with many aspects of modern life, the outlook is not relentlessly gloomy. Never have there been more options to choose from. If you want to find a dairy committed to ethical practices, they are out there. If you want to use M*lk, made from a “nut” (but really water flavoured with an edible tuber), that exists too. And if you’re happy to ignore the incongruity of pouring another animal’s milk in your tea, then the shops will still stock your blue, green and red for a while yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3980137dbe671e8c3bccfa8d7de9605f4a1518b9/0_10_600_360/master/600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4380419b552fe0553cb6a5c421a20aa5","title":"puglian primitivo beautiful big flavours at lovely small prices","story":"Enjoy the sweet power of these rich reds from southern ItalyFollow David on Twitter @Daveydaibach This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The capacity to fight back, to score late goals and to win games that have seemed lost is undoubtedly a useful one, but it does raise major questions about how Mourinho should approach Sunday’s Manchester derby.Wednesday’s victory at Juventus was the third time in the last six games that United have found a winner in the final five minutes, but it was also the fifth time in those six matches that they had conceded the opening goal of the game. It is as though they need the release of going behind to commit to attack – and this unbalanced squad is far more set up to attack than to defend. At Chelsea, and to a lesser extent against Everton, United suffered when, having secured a lead, they then tried to defend it.That Mourinho finds himself in this situation in his third season at a club is, frankly, preposterous. How, after more than 100 games of Joséfication, can he have a squad still so little in his image, one that does not relish the harness but demands to be set free to run wild and enjoy itself? Football’s soul has become bedraggled recently, pounded on all sides by bags of gold, but it retains a keenly ironic streak.Yet it may be that his squad’s anarchic nature does Mourinho a favour on Sunday. All his instincts will be to kill the game against City, to defend and provoke and block and spoil. This was the path on which he embarked after being overlooked for the Barcelona job in 2008: to be the anti-Barça. If they played with the ball, he would play without it. If they pressed high, he would employ a low block. If they set themselves up as the bearers of light, he, the fallen Lucifer, formed by the kingdom but rejected from it, would embrace the darkness.But that might not be the best way to approach this game, not just because of United’s characteristics but because of City. The 2010 Champions League semi-final second leg is an obvious exception – although Internazionale did lose that game while winning the tie – but Mourinho’s best results against Guardiola sides have tended to come when he has been forced to attack.In the second leg of the Copa del Rey quarter-final in 2011-12, for instance, Mourinho’s Real Madrid found themselves 4-1 down to Guardiola’s Barcelona. With the game essentially gone, they lost their inhibitions, scored twice and found themselves in the final minutes, implausibly, chasing an away-goals victory. In that second half, the popular theory goes, Madrid lost their fear of Barça. They went on to win the league.Closer to home, there was April’s derby at the Etihad, when United overturned a 2-0 deficit to win 3-2. City may have conceded only four times in the league this season, but the goals‑against column is no longer a way of measuring how good a team are defensively. Last season City conceded only 27 goals in the league but they still looked shaky whenever they came up against a side with the technical ability and nerve to play through their press – notably Liverpool and United.Anybody can keep clean sheets if the opposition cannot get the ball: the real test of a defence comes when they actually have to defend. It may be that City are getting better at doing that. At Liverpool last month, Guardiola set his side up in what was in effect a 4-4-2 formation, with David Silva as a second striker, and the two wide men, Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling, charged with protecting the full-backs. Even then, Kyle Walker was restrained in his forward sallies, tucking in at times as a third central defender as Benjamin Mendy pushed on.Would he bother with a similar policy against United? This is where selections become a game of chicken. If United sit deep, they would no doubt be delighted if City are conservative (although that 4-4-2 can be adjusted to the more familiar 4-3-3 easily enough). But what if United, already nine points behind their neighbours, go for broke?What if Mourinho eschews his dogmatic reactivity to become truly pragmatic and does not what ideology dictates but what is most likely to bring a win and attacks, even if that also risks heavy defeat?A sense there is nothing left to lose has perhaps stimulated Mourinho as much as his players. His hand-to-the-ear gesture in Turin may have been ludicrously immature for a man of 55, but it was classic Mourinho, as was his joke afterwards about getting the FA to translate Italian insults directed at him. A spark of fun and mischief seems to have been reignited in him and that perhaps might give him the courage to do as his own side, his opponent, circumstance and precedent would seem to suggest he should do, and attack.What if, amending the familiar Sunday league instruction to pretend it’s 0-0, he tells his players to go out and play as if they are already 2-0 down? What do City do then? How readily can they slip into that more cautious style they adopted at Anfield? City will likely have the majority of the possession but this game may not have the attack-vs‑defence nature of a typical Guardiola‑Mourinho encounter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1402fe241817fc83673d201c82a1f1e8e3c116b7/0_148_2828_1697/master/2828.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d6b13ca1a6f77a108efd4f4f6c9c19d","title":"liverpool v fulham premier league live","story":"35 min Mane’s cutback from the left of the box deflects into the path of Shaqiri, who screws a shot just wide from the edge of the box.34 min Sessegnon moves smartly away from van Dijk before smashing high over the bar from a tight angle.

After nice play from Sessegnon and Cairney, Schurrle’s low shot from 20 yards is spilled by the ing Alisson, who is lucky that it lands at the feet of van Dijk rather than Mitrovic.29 min Rico is going to be booked for timewasting in a minute. He’s taking an age over every goalkick.28 min Mane makes space on the edge of the area and curls miles over the bar.24 min: What a chance for Fulham! Rico’s long goalkick was headed on by Mitrovic to Sessegnon, who bumbled past Gomez and through on goal. He struck a firm low shot from the edge of the area which beat Alisson and curled this far wide of the far post. He’ll feel he should have scored.22 min: Another chance for Liverpool! Shaqiri lifts a cute pass over the top for Salah, who whistles a half-volley towards goal from a tight angle with his right foot. Rico shows excellent reactions, moving smartly to his right to beat the shot away.21 min “And I’ve got Firmino as captain,” weeps Matt Dony. “Between the two of us, I think we’ve pretty much guaranteed another flat attacking performance. I hate Fantasy Football. But I keep crawling back to it, like the weak-willed loser I am.”Don’t be so harsh on yourself. You’re not willed, etc.20 min Fabinho drives an angled pass over the top for Alexander-Arnold, who tries an imaginative lobbed header on the run which lands on the roof of the net. Rico had it covered. Yet again Alexander-Arnold got the wrong side of Sessegnon.18 min Fulham are working very hard defensively. It feels like a goal is going to come sooner rather than later, though.16 min: Rico makes a vital save from Salah! The build up between Firmino and Salah was gorgeous, a double one-two at speed just outside the area. Salah then slithered past Odoi before stabbing a close-range shot that was smothered by the keeper.14 min Liverpool have a ball on from left to right all the time, with Shaqiri and especially Alexander-Arnold constantly in space.13 min Firmino sweeps the ball across the field to Shaqiri, who moves forward and slams a fine low shot just wide from 25 yards. Rico had it covered - he might have got a touch in fact - but it was beautfully hit.12 min Fulham look mildly dangerous on the break. They haven’t come just to defend. Liverpool are dominating the game but could do with moving the ball a bit faster.10 min Fulham win their first corner, to be taken by Schurrle. His outswinger is lumped away by Robertson at the near post.9 min It’s so quiet at Anfield. 6 min Shaqiri delays before finding Alexander-Arnold, who flashes a rising cross over everyone. Liverpool are looking dangerous.4 min: Mane misses a great chance. Alexander-Arnold’s bouncing cross was miscontrolled by Firmino but fell nicely for Mane, who struck it well wide from 12 yards. Prat’s my Fantasy League captain an’ all.3 min It’s been a slow start on the field and a quiet one off it. I suppose early kick-offs don’t help in either regard. Remember that period from (I think) 1996-98 when some Sky games kicked off at 11.15am? That was a challenge for the alcohol-loving supporter.2 min It looks like both teams are playing 4-2-3-1 - Liverpool with Salah up front, Fulham with Cairney behind Mitrovic.1 min Fulham, in white, kick off from left to right. Liverpool are in red.After an immaculate minute’s silence to mark Armistice Day, the players assume their positions. “A very fine morning to you,” says Armchair Ian Copestake. “My support of Liverpool is fear-based: the fear in particular of losing to the bottom side and losing ground on the impossibles above us while having a shedload of narratives plunge down upon us from tomorrow. That aside I’m optimistic.”It’s weird, isn’t it? Liverpool haven’t even lost a league game yet it already feels like their title challenge is hanging by a thread because of City’s form.“Performance?” sniffs Tim Woods. “Bah. As a Liverpool fan, I’d happily take 27 utterly, mind-numbingly tedious 1-0 wins if it handed us the title. I just want this long, agonising, self-entitled 29 year (and counting) wait to be over.”“When you have a poor result and a disappointing performance, you want to see a reaction. I saw Fulham play against City and City had to work really, really hard. It looks like they have at least four centre-halves on the pitch, however they line up, so it won’t be easy for us. We’re ready for that. Let’s go for it.“Henderson and Keita are ready but somebody from the Premier League told me we can only line up with 11 players and I thought we should at least accept this rule.”“We are bottom of the table and we need some kind of reaction. I won’t tell you our formation but we want to be more solid while still playing our football. It’s not a great situation for us and we need to improve our performance. We have many plans – A, B, C, D – but we believe this is the best one to start the game.” ‘Remember when’ is the lowest form of conversationPre-match reading and thatMorning. It’s quite wrong to say football is a results business. It’s far more demanding and cut-throat than that. There is more focus on performances and style than ever before - as well as the same expectaton when it comes to results. The only way to keep everyone happy is to win the league with 100 points and some of the most stylish football ever seen in Britain, and even then they’ll moan about Project Longbow and sportswashing.Even the neutrals have become entitled. Why aren’t you, Liverpool, entertaining me, Armchair Bob, like you did last season? On results alone, Liverpool have had a great start to the season, yet there is a slightly strange mood around the team. They could be top of the Premier League tonight, for flip’s sake. But they haven’t played the same spectacular football as last season due to the absence of their star man, Maurice Jo.We don’t yet know whether he’ll be available against the bottom club Fulham today. When he does return, some poor sods are going to take a serious hiding. And when that happens, everyone in this results, performance and perception business will be happy.Kick off is at 12pm.

Florists, midwives, bakers and others throw some light on the challenges of going nocturnalWhen I was younger, I was always that kid half-asleep in school because I’d been awake the night before unable to sleep. It makes sense that now I pretty much start work when everyone is bedding in for the evening. I think it’s when my creativity kicks in, when I want to socialise. When I wake up I don’t want people to look me in the face – but when night comes that doesn’t matter, because I’ve made a new one: the makeup is on, I’ve made a hat and done my nails. I can go and face the world.I’m part of the furniture at Savage – the gay disco I run at an East End strip club on a Saturday night. It means I can run in last minute from another gig, throw my bags down and get to work. I’m usually working the door, which means standing on the street until 4am come rain or shine. I never factored that into my drag career – the number of coats I’d need to buy to make sure I look fabulous when it’s -5C.A drink or two, well, or seven, helps me make it through the night. Alcohol is a lube that makes working the night run smoothly. That said, I do a regular sweep of the club as it gets busier and have a quiet word with anyone who’s looking too wasted. “Have a bottle of water, babe,” I’ll tell them, while pointing in the direction of the toilets so they can sort themselves out.Our venue is a strip club through the week, so there’ll be guys who turn up and don’t know there’s a gay disco in. We tell unknowing punters that there’s a private party and point them down the road.I clock off at 4am, so I get to enjoy the final hour of the party. Even if I’m exhausted, I’ll stay for a dance and to take in what we’ve created. The bouncers all finish at 5am sharp, but that’s also kicking out time. We spit 150 people out on to the street, and they can be vulnerable. I don’t mind staying a little longer, making sure everyone is hydrated and makes it home OK. I’ll never forget that time that I was beaten up on a night out.By the time the night is over, I can’t wait to be outside – especially in the summer when dawn is breaking. I jump on my bike and cycle along the deserted canals in all my regalia. I love the feeling of taking my heels and lashes off at the end of the night. You learn early on that drag is uncomfortable – whether that’s staying awake all night working, or itchy wigs and scratchy face. It’s gritty and sweaty, and it ends up smudged all over your pillow. But you also learn to be poised, and to work through it. To dance it off, or just hide in the toilet while you regain your composure. I used to feel out of place in nightclubs, like a misfit. In drag I’m the outrageous colour at the party, the caretaker of the club.I started out at the market when I was four years old. Both my dad and my uncle Mick were in the business, so I’d go and help. By 14 I’d left school. My dad explained to the headmaster I’d be better off working. And he was right. Even now I don’t feel like I go to work, I go on holiday every day and I enjoy it. When you work nights you have no life, so the market becomes it. You don’t do it for the money. You’ve got no time to spend what you earn anyway. I’m at work when everyone else is down at the pub.The first thing I do when I wake up, around 1am, is have a black coffee. You never get used to getting up so early. Then I head to the market. We unload, get the orders sorted, put out the flowers nice and orderly so they look effective to the eye.Our first customers come in about 3am – florists, event organisers, hotel porters. There’s less bartering than there used to be, although we are a market, so you can always try it. But you don’t necessarily have to go cheap for people to buy from you, it’s about being on their wavelength and approachable. It’s like if there’s a nice barman at a pub who you get on with, you become a local.I live on between two and four hours sleep a day, I’ve been that way since I was a kid. I’m fortunate. My dad is the same, we just don’t need it. My working day is over by midday, so there was always time to spend with the family. That’s more important to me – I’ll get all the sleep I want when I’m dead.When you work at the market, you help each other out. If I run out of a particular flower or something I’ll go and get some from someone else for a reasonable price so I can still make a profit. It works because I do the same for them. By 11am we’re finished, so then it’s into the van for an hour to deliver orders. Traffic and the congestion charge means not everyone can make it down to Vauxhall. Then I’m off to the golf course.People thought we were mad, opening a bakery in Yorkshire, in the height of Thatcher’s Britain, when we first arrived in Otley in 1983. Independent businesses were closing down at a rate of knots. God bless Paul Hollywood, but back then the craft of proper baking wasn’t as popular as it is now. My partner Steve and I fitted the place ourselves. We were working on a shoestring, which meant we’d sell through the day and bake through the night. The secret? Well, 35 years later he’s still making me laugh.When you’re younger, you can do the nights pretty easily. We went to a friend’s 21st birthday party and stayed well into the early hours of the morning before heading back to crack on with the baking – I’ll never forget the sight of Steve falling asleep on the step by the ovens with the loaves still inside. It was quite romantic in those days, being holed up in the kitchen – and occasionally dancing. We built a business together while we built a life. Now we’ve got a team, so our shift patterns vary and it’s a little more professional. But it’s all hands on deck come 8pm on a Friday.I adore working through the early hours, it’s almost magical. Inside the bakery it’s hot and a hive of activity – music blaring from the radio as we fill the shelves with treats which bring the shop to life. But step outside into the darkness for a moment and it’s serene and silent. In the winter, taking in the icy air and the moonlight can reinvigorate you better than coffee ever can. We’ll always keep the door open if it’s snowing.In the summer, the birds are there to keep you company as the light starts to trickle over the Chevin. We’ll pop outside together – whoever is working – to look at the sky, as picturesque and tranquil as they seem in Turner’s paintings. The aroma of fresh-baked bread mixed with the morning air makes for a heady cocktail.There’s always a lull – it hits you at about three in the morning – but we turn the music up a little louder, have a singalong, and then carry on. If I can, though, I’ll head out to do some deliveries in the early hours of Saturday morning. It means I get to drive through the beautiful countryside before anyone else. Of course, if I’m in the van, I’ve got to stick to a schedule. But at the top of the Chevin I’ve been known to pull into a pub car park and take in dawn in all its splendour for a moment. You feel like you own the earth – and it’s wonderful. Not for too long, though, the bread needs to be delivered. And the bakery needs to be open again by 7am.After 30 years as a midwife, I’ve pretty much seen it all. One day you’re part of the happiest night of somebody’s life, the next you’re there to support them through tragedy. Ups and downs are part of the course, as is working 247.In a unit like ours, the lights are on day or night, you sometimes don’t even notice the difference. I suppose there are less managers, matrons and office staff around, but our job stays exactly the same. It means our tight-knit night team is totally patient-focused. We’re a sociable unit – we try to eat together when we can. If we’re being good, we might have a salad night, and occasionally we’ll order pizzas. Otherwise everyone brings different bits in and, when we can, we share. It’s awful for the waistline, but great for the soul. Nights can be long and hard, so spending time together is good for morale.The secret to making it through the night is sleeping between shifts. There’s nothing worse than being exhausted but needing to be awake and alert at three in the morning. You can’t falter: you’re responsible for the lives of women and their babies. I’m lucky, I’m a good sleeper at whatever time. I used to get out of bed for the kids. But mine are grown up now, so I can indulge myself. Although at night if I wake up for a wee, I can go back to sleep. In the daytime that can be a little harder.Sometimes it’s difficult to sleep if something upsetting has happened the night before. The warm fuzzy feeling you get from delivering a healthy baby is comforting, but there are scary nights, when something happens to a baby. You learn to switch off, but however long you do the job it can still get to you. Babies are robust creatures. It’s amazing what they can cope with, even if they need a little bit of help. They’re tougher than you might imagine.I never set out to be a midwife, but I’ve loved my time in the job. Helping bring life into the world, especially when outside the ward everyone is sleeping, gives you a buzz. And the excitement is that for 12 hours at a time anyone could walk in through the door, ready to start that journey. Even tiredness can be staved off when a baby is being born.You can get a call at anytime from the transplant coordinator. From then you have an hour to be at the hospital and ready to go. That is why I live close by. I do not have the luxury of time to travel or prepare when the phone rings. I’ll have already worked a full day in the operating theatre, so if you’re on call at night – as I am twice a week – I get to sleep after I finish a day shift as soon as I can. Sometimes I would not be able to get home. If something comes up at the end of the day I might be working close to 24 hours at a time. Everything is already prepared. We’ll get our kit together during the day and sort out the trolley.Two teams get called in at night, and I can be on either. One retrieves the liver for transplantation from deceased donors, the other will do the implantation operation when the organ arrives. It’s not a heart-warming operation to undertake, collecting an organ. But we know that it’s going to give someone else another shot at life. Generally we’ll take an ambulance and drive through the city, flashing lights on if necessary. But if other teams are busy we could end up travelling to other cities, or even abroad.People in the health service work incredibly hard, especially at night, but at times you cannot help but feel exhausted. You’ve got to stay awake and stay alert, so we try to nap whenever it’s possible. We look out for each other, work together and support each other. When you’re working a night, a patient may well never see you before you operate on them. I’ll see people recovering across the hospital who I’ve cared for who’ll never even know who I am. Sometimes a partner or a loved one will point us out and say: “Him! That’s the guy!”When I finally start to head home, I’m exhausted. I’ll sit in the ambulance and stare out the window watching the city pass by as I try to wind down. It’s a comfort to think people from all corners of the world are working through the night in our NHS. Teams of people in wards, determined to do all they can to save lives.When I come to work at 5.30pm, I spend an hour “reading in” – that’s radio-talk for taking in the stories from across the globe. Then we start putting the show together: we’re live until 5am, so even with pre-prepared parts, we have up to three hours to fill when we go live at 1am. As a journalist, it can be tough – the offices are basically empty at night. But that’s also a thrill and, being the BBC, people know who we are and trust us. It gives us extraordinary access into people’s lives.Take the night of the Manchester attack – I spoke to people who couldn’t find their friends, to eye witnesses and experts. We had to work out what to say – we can’t just spread rumours. At 3am the fire, police and ambulance departments all released information to say 19 were dead. That was a horrible moment. There’s a pause, and then you carry on. There’s a secret gear in the gearbox you tap into when you’re doing breaking news through the night. Nothing quite hits you at the time, it can’t if you’re going to do your job. But, of course, once the news stopped rolling and the adrenaline subsided, I just wanted to cry.I struggle to keep myself awake sometimes. I’ve never fallen asleep at the desk, but I’ve come close. Walking around the deserted office helps, as does sugar. Lots of sugar. I have been known to scour the empty desks for leftover packets of Haribo. We all have different theories on how best to make it through: mine is eating your last meal at 10pm – a giant bowl of pasta. You just don’t want to eat after that. Coffee is good, but at that time it tastes disgusting. That’s the hard thing about working nights, everything feels gross. By 3am you just feel grubby.We finish around half-five in the morning. I drive home in silence, and get into bed fully dressed. It doesn’t take long to switch off. By about 7.45am, my husband will send in one of the kids to wake me up. I have half an hour to drink a coffee, clean my teeth and get ready for the school run, still in last night’s clothes and make-up. I get them to school, come home, and then I don’t touch TV or anything. I’ll get into my PJs and go back to bed.Having someone live overnight is important. For all the podcasts and pre-records, there’s something irreplaceable about a real-life person coming out of a box in your house or your car. Our listeners depend on us. We know who’s listening: milkmen, posties, factory workers, lorry drivers. Some are struggling to sleep in the midst of depression. When I became a mum at 24, I was the first of my friends to have a child. Radio kept me sane on those lonely nights up feeding. We’re all leading more insular lives. If you’re isolated, on your own, or can’t leave the house for whatever reason, you can turn us on. We’re there for you – to keep you company while you’re awake, safe in the knowledge that whatever happens we’ll still be there.When I started out as a tea boy in the industry, we didn’t work as many nights. But as the country has begun to operate on a 24-hour basis, we’re drafted in to work on tight schedules after dark, to make sure what we do causes minimal disruption. I’m now the supervisor for resurfacing works: setting up jobs, checking quality to make sure specifications are as required. If it’s fixing the surface we’ll re-lay it, if it’s new we build from the foundations up. As a minimum we’ll have a low loader bringing in machinery, a paver, a roller and a JCB. Then there’s a sweeper, the muck-away trucks and a spray tanker. It makes for quite a convoy – but we need it all to keep the roads and runways safe.I’ve got four young kids and working nights means I get to spend a lot of time with them. I might miss them in the morning, but after school I’m around the house. I wouldn’t be if I was working days contesting with rush-hour traffic.If I’ve got to bed by 5am, I’ll be awake again by 11ish. I’ll check some emails, see what’s planned for later, and then head to the gym or sort out the house. A lot of my work is now at Heathrow, so I’ll be on site by about 10pm to get our team briefed for the night ahead. Once the final plane has left the runway we come out of the shadows and get to work. Whatever time we get started – and there are often delays – we have to be clear by the time the first flight is due to land at 4.45am.You get to see behind the scenes when you’re on nights: airports are a hive of activity once the runways are shut. It’s the same on the motorways. I work the M40 because it’s not far from our house. Sure, it’s a little quieter, but the world keeps on going with drivers heading to and fro from dusk until dawn. It’s hard to put my finger on it, but there’s definitely a different ambience when you work through the night. We enjoy what we do and everyone’s more focused. Maybe it’s because there are fewer distractions and there’s little wriggle room in our timings. Or it might just be the promise of getting into bed when it’s all done.If you’re working 12-hour shifts, four nights on and four nights off, you need to look after your mind and your body. When I arrive at Brown’s Hotel to start at 8pm it’s the busiest time for me: guests want tables that night at restaurants that get booked up weeks in advance and to be on the list at London’s most exclusive clubs. We provide a 24-hour concierge service, and we get requests you couldn’t even imagine. Our job is to always say yes – as long as it’s legal – even if something seems impossible.By 1am things tend to be a little quieter. At home before a shift I’ll make a meal and split it in half. Once the evening rush fades away I’ll eat my first meal. I’ll eat the other half before we get busy again, usually just before 5am. Diet is important – I eat healthily, lots of protein. I don’t drink coffee, so it’s nutrition that keeps me awake and focused through the night.After dark, it can be a challenge to provide everything our guests might wish for. But you build a network of contacts in the city and in concierge teams across the world. A couple of weeks back a member of a Middle Eastern royal family wanted Krispy Kreme donuts at 5am – long before any shop was open. The other day we were tasked with arranging a helicopter in a call that came in after midnight to pick up our guests at 7am. Then there was the time we were asked to bring a guest’s wildcat into the UK without separating it from its owner. We were faced with the legal requirement of it having to be kept in a “zoo environment” so we went ahead and had one built on his private estate.There’s no secret trick to the job. If you’re nice to people, to everyone you meet, everything becomes so much easier. My contact book is a manual, a guide to the city at night.I grew up on a council estate in Islington. The culture here was something of a shock at first. But serving in the army prepared me well for the job: never say no, present yourself immaculately, and high standards even in challenging circumstances are a must. To join the Golden Keys Society – an international network of concierges – you quite literally need to serve your time to earn your stripes.And then we finish at 8am – and it’s rush hour in the capital. It’s quite a nice feeling, getting into bed when everyone is going to work. You can tell who else has worked the night – everyone has their head down. You experiment in search of the easiest way home. It’s not just the fastest, but the quietest – where will you get a seat? I’m always tweaking the route. Anyone getting off the train with you at the end of the line has done a night shift as well. There’s a solidarity there amongst the group of zombies.Every call starts the same: “Hello, Samaritans, can I help?” From there anything can happen. You have to clear your mind, be in a positive headspace when you’re on shift. I’ve got a ritual for it now. My friend, who I volunteer with, picks me up in her car around 10pm – we have a happy playlist which we sing along to on the way in. At half-10 when we take over, we’ve already made a pot of tea, and sorted a tray of biscuits. Then we turn the phones on. From that point on it doesn’t stop. I was surprised at first at how busy we are. There’s so many people in so much despair, but I’m just glad they’re trying to reach out and talk to us.Callers talk about loneliness, depression, suicide, grief. It could be anything really. We don’t give advice, we just encourage people to open up – and then we listen. I don’t think most people realise how much that helps. Everyone is anonymous, sometimes they’ll tell me their name, but often they won’t. Either way I’ll never know who they are, or speak with them again. That can be the hardest part, especially after a really emotional conversation. It’s the best thing for it, though. I always just assume the best happened, you can’t let yourself think about the alternative. But it’s sometimes hard not to wonder what happened to them next.What strikes me sometimes is just how together someone’s life might sound on the surface: a caller might talk about their family, their friends, their job and their security – but in their mind there’s no light and nothing to live for. Anyone they might otherwise turn to is asleep – when you’re alone with nowhere to turn you can just keep on falling. That’s why we’re there every hour of every day.Doing the phones at night can make you feel quite isolated. There’s no hustle and bustle, nobody driving past the windows or chatting outside. When a call ends, I check in on my shift partner and we’ll have a cuppa.At the end we drive home in silence. We give ourselves space to wind down. You’ve been dealing with other people’s lives for hours – just minutes ago it almost felt like daytime. Now it’s pitch black and you’re all alone. When I get into bed I cuddle my partner. It can take a while – even when it’s so late – to actually fall asleep.I never called the Samaritans before I became a volunteer, but I know friends who did. Since starting, I’ve called in myself when I’ve been struggling. Having experienced the same feelings as callers is almost a superpower when you’re a Samaritan. People can hear in my voice that I really do understand them, and it reminds me that it’s normal to feel overwhelmed. In a weird way it’s like I’ve got relationships with people all over the country, but I’ll never know them and they’ll never know me. It also changes you. I ask people how they are at university, or when I’m on shift at Tesco. You learn the importance of checking people are OK.

Centre Point, that brutalist tower block when you come out of Tottenham Court Road tube, you know, near Primark. You know. The one homelessness campaigners occupied when it stood empty in 1974, rough sleepers sheltering under the ground floor, leading to the charity borrowing its name and it becoming a concrete monument to the plight of the homeless. You know. Centre Point, where, in 2015, flats were put on the market for £1.8m, rising to £55m for the penthouse, with its views through the Centre Point sign and down on London’s smog below, a horizon continually being razed to dust and rebuilt in glass.Developers reported the first apartments had been sold at the asking price, including one that went for £5m to the parents of a Chinese student due to start at UCL this term. And I feel for her. I do. I can picture her, lonely, sitting in the empty residents’ bar or spa after lectures, as half the apartments remain unsold. I can imagine the silence, the double-glazed, deafening silence of a largely uninhabited tower block opposite the theatre showing Bat Out of Hell – it would have the dense soft texture of a hotel towelling robe. But rather than lowering the price to attract other buyers, developers have chosen to take the unsold flats off the market and keep them empty, claiming the offers they’ve received are “detached from reality”. As in 1974, Centre Point stands almost empty again, joining hundreds of other unsold luxury apartment blocks, “ghost towers”, dark windowed at night.It can make you feel quite dizzy, can’t it, this relentless cycle of greed and emptiness. I’m reminded of the fairground scene in Problem Child 2, where the waltzer starts spinning out of control, and one child pukes on another, causing them to puke on a third, and so on until the parents are puking and the bully is puking and the grass is swimming with porridge-like sick and people are slipping in the stuff and the music gets faster and faster until everything is brown and nothing is dry, and the world is revealed to be simply a receptacle for vomit.2015. That was a funny time – they say if you remember it you weren’t really there, or at least, unmedicated. It was the year a £15bn housing project in Battersea advertised plans to build a “sky pool” that would adjoin two luxury apartment blocks, a 25m swimming pool with a transparent floor, 10 storeys above the borough where almost two in five children were growing up in poverty, a literal glass ceiling. It was the year housing officers discovered 26 people living in a three-bedroom home in east London, in “one of the most extreme examples of illegal overcrowding” they’d ever seen, and the year the mysterious owner of what had become London’s most expensive private house (Witanhurst, £300m, includes an underground village) was revealed to be Russia’s 28th richest man, spending £2m a week on the basement dig. 2015, that was when the waltzer was at its fastest.“Housing,” the meeting must have gone, in a members’ club somewhere in the dying embers of the 20th century, well before Centre Point’s developers rolled out the phrase “detached from reality” with all the irony of an unplugged iron, “housing – that’s the one where we build houses in order to home the UK’s huddled masses, right? Hmm, isn’t that a bit… done? Right? So what I’m thinking – is there any way to zhuzh it up a bit? Add a bit of spice? What if, instead of homes blah blah, etc, we provided a series of living metaphors for our broken priorities through the medium of large scale art installations with steam rooms in the basement? Yes? Yes! Things are going to go extremely well, high five!” The high five because it was a simpler time.We are now in the “standing in fairground vomit” stage of London’s housing experiment, when not only have the poor people been screwed over, their options narrowed to a very fine expensive spike, one that seems to be pointing ever more urgently in the direction of “Exit”, but the rich people are unhappy, too, their grand plans having deflated to the sound of an orchestral fart. What now? What the living hell now? In February it was reported that London councils had granted property developers planning permission to build more than 26,000 new luxury flats priced at more than £1m each, half at least destined surely to stand empty. One day this city of grand ambition and breathtaking culture will be a ghost town.

But then the tradition was hijacked by upmarket retailers, and you came to expect a craft gin miniature, artisan cheese or mindfulness tips. This year, though, traditionalists are fighting back.Craft store Hobbycraft reports bumper sales of calendar-making kit, while Scandinavian retailer Flying Tiger Copenhagen is enjoying a run on its pakkekalenders – the Danish take on Advent, which involves wrapping and displaying 24 inidual presents.“It is cost-effective if you make the Advent calendar yourself,” says Katherine Paterson, customer development director at Hobbycraft. “That’s one reason, but it’s not the main reason: personalisation is the driving force behind this trend.”There is little sales data available on the size of the UK craft market, but it is estimated that a broad church of hobbyists, which includes knitters, embroiderers and model-makers, spend close to £3bn a year on projects.DIY Advent calendars are an extension of a Christmas cottage industry that includes cards, crackers and even personalised tree baubles this year. More than 12,000 people have attended workshops in Hobbycraft’s stores this winter as they prepare to tackle projects ranging from crackers to a papier-mâché stag’s head.“People get into crafting because it is a good antidote to tech,” says Paterson. “It’s like the whole hygge thing. People are making time to do something they enjoy, like holding a wreath-making evening with friends as a social thing.”Over the past decade the notion of what constitutes an Advent calendar has changed dramatically. The most previous generations could hope for was cheap chocolate. Upmarket brands such as Selfridges and Space NK opened the floodgates at the start of this decade by creating luxury iterations that cost more than the average person’s entire Christmas shopping budget.Calendar inflation means that this year you can spend anywhere between £1 – on a Cadbury Dairy Milk-filled calendar in Tesco – and £349 for a porcelain Villeroy \u0026amp Boch advent calendar tree in Harrods. Other variants are aimed at the UK’s growing number of vegans and even at pets.“We have already seen a surge in sales, which indicates that these predictions were correct.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36f91d5af5d9e8c8202c04146e084b6b0455a061/0_95_5123_3075/master/5123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f93a710afdce67d81cbdbfdeaa5a67e8","title":"parents screen time children technology limit education","story":"Setting aside time to ensure children are ready for school should be a priority, says ministerParents need to drag themselves away from their smartphones and tablets and ensure that their young children are ready to learn at school, according to the education secretary.Damian Hinds said that, while a lot of attention had been placed on limiting the screentime of children, adults also needed to make sure they were not glued to their phones and were prioritising “one-to-one time without gadgets”.“As a parent, I’m also conscious that, while we think about screen time limits for children, we find it harder to limit it for ourselves – but that one-to-one time without gadgets getting in the way is so valuable,’ he said.“The pressures of work and the modern world mean putting phones away is far from easy, but it’s an important area to talk about, particularly as we consider ways to support parents with children’s learning at home. This doesn’t mean technology is the villain of the piece – indeed, if used well it can actively support learning. Technology is something we must harness to use in our mission to improve communication skills, not something that gets in the way.”Recent research suggests that parents need “off-hours” from their devices just as much as their children. Advice drawn up by academics at the University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health suggests that children learn smartphone habits from their parents, making it important to unplug in favour of screen-free playtime. The findings are revealed amid reports that nannies are being asked to sign contracts limiting social media during work hours. Hinds will hold a summit this week with businesses, media and technology groups to find ways of encouraging parents to help with early learning at home. The aim is to help them improve their child’s basic communication skills, such as reading and singing. Ministers have already been working with the National Literacy Trust and Save the Children to develop a set of recommended activities for families, from playing with numbers to songs and poems.“As the vast majority of children’s time is spent at home, we need to think about how we support parents with learning in the home environment,” Hinds said.“This could be seen as the last taboo in education, and certainly no one wants to be lecturing parents. But it is a persistent scandal that too many children are starting school unable to communicate effectively, and we know that what happens at home makes a big difference in that.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32fba9e421c5466c37c579d7d46df7659a5a60ae/100_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0788bc584facf0ac6624b25c78e3fadd","title":"netflix scotland outlaw king tourism","story":"Bruising portrait of the leader may add to a visitor surge that is already under wayAt Linlithgow Palace, the birthplace of Scotland’s tragic Mary, Queen of Scots, the volunteer guides and workers are preparing for a tourist surge.This 15th-century palace, a bulwark of the Stuart dynasty, is astonishingly well preserved and already draws visitors who walk among its stone halls and ramparts and admire its little loch. But Frances Murray, tour guide and shop manager, knows there are more on the way. Why? Because last week Netflix launched Outlaw King, a production about the life of Robert the Bruce, filmed in part at Linlithgow. And, following the huge success of the Outlander TV drama series, filmed in several Scottish locations, the country knows a thing or two about the TV effect.“The uplift places such as this get from television shows like Outlander is amazing, and we’re expecting the same from Outlaw King,” said Murray yesterday. “Sometimes, though, we get tourists from overseas who ask to see specific rooms where some of the scenes were shot, and we have to explain that they don’t actually exist. But this is such a beautiful and interesting building that they soon get wrapped up in it.”The West Lothian palace was only one of several Scottish locations for the new film, which stars Chris Pine as the warrior overlord. The others read like the index of a tourist brochure: Borthwick Castle, Dunfermline Abbey, Glasgow Cathedral and Doune Castle near Stirling. And the beautiful landscapes of Skye are already upstaging the principal actors.VisitScotland, the national tourist agency, has produced two glossy and substantial brochures that chronicle some recent world-class productions. On the cover of one of them a moody Daniel Craig as James Bond in Skyfall stands beside his silver Aston Martin with the mists of Glen Coe gathering behind him. In 2015 an online poll conducted by USA Today voted Scotland the world’s best cinematic destination. The country’s filmic credits include well-known movies such as Braveheart, The Da Vinci Code, The 39 Steps and Whisky Galore. But it also makes atmospheric cameo appearances in movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, where the ethereal beauty of Harris was deployed by Stanley Kubrick to realise his imagined Jupiter.Next year another major historical drama built around this nation’s vivid and bloody history will be released in British cinemas. This time it will be Mary, Queen of Scots herself who will get the Hollywood treatment in a film starring Saoirse Ronan and David Tennant.Tourism, along with whisky and salmon, forms the cornerstone of the Scottish economy. In a recent interview Malcolm Roughead, chief executive of VisitScotland, said: “Tourism is integral to sustaining communities across Scotland by generating income, creating jobs and stimulating social change – and it generates around £11bn of economic activity.” He also reckoned that one new job is created in Scotland for every £60,000 spent by visitors.Fiona Hyslop, culture and tourism minister in the Scottish government, yesterday spoke of her delight that the world’s top film and television producers are now making Scotland one of their first destinations. “Producers now know that when they choose Scotland, as well as magnificent scenery and locations they’re now getting highly-skilled and professional technical crews to go with them,” she said.Crucially, too, the long wait for a world-class national film studio could soon be over. At last week’s Bafta Scotland awards first minister Nicola Sturgeon referred to the need for a national film studio, saying: “Watch this space.”Yet some would say that with its remarkable scenery and stunning vistas, Scotland already possesses the best natural film studio in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33f44941b6950583dcd6b7bf33559a6492251f4a/0_200_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dcc3e37d346dd23e742a67fd00801ba","title":"taking on the eu podcast","story":"The former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis staked his political career on getting a deal with the European Union – and lost.

There are some trade-offs.”May’s hopes of getting the cabinet to sign off her Brexit deal proposals at a crunch meeting this week appeared to be hanging in the balance amid warnings that even if ministers are “bounced” into giving it their backing at cabinet, MPs could still block it.She also faces a growing rebellion from the remainer wing of her party with rumours that four more pro-Europe ministers are on the brink of resigning after the departure of transport minister Jo Johnson, who quit on Friday calling for a second referendum.The prime minister’s woes were intensified by reports that the European Union had rejected her proposal for an “independent mechanism” that could allow the UK to quit a temporary customs arrangement if Brexit talks collapsed.Hinds ruled out a key Brexiter demand for a unilateral exit mechanism from the Irish backstop, saying it was “very, very unlikely” that the proposal would get agreement from the EU and telling colleagues that any alternative plan had to be “realistic”.He said: “They need to think about what the alternatives are as well. It is no good just not liking inidual aspects. If you’re going to take that view, you have got to have in mind a realistic, viable, deliverable alternative. I think people are going to be getting behind this deal and saying ‘yeah, let’s get on with it’.”It comes after Steve Baker, the deputy of the European Research Group (ERG) of hard-Brexit Tory MPs, and Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman, said they would oppose any agreement they thought threatened the union and could lead to a trade border down the Irish Sea.“We share the prime minister’s ambition for an EU free trade agreement, but not at any price, and certainly not at the price of our union,” they wrote. “If the government makes the historic mistake of prioritising placating the EU over establishing an independent and whole UK, then, regrettably, we must vote against the deal.”May also faces pressure from Tory europhiles. The former cabinet minister Justine Greening called on her Tory MPs to block her plan. “The parliamentary deadlock has been clear for some time. It’s crucial now for parliament to vote down this plan, because it is the biggest giveaway of sovereignty in modern times,” she said.The arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg called on the prime minister to change tack, throwing his weight behind a plan to leave with no deal next March but pay £18bn and follow EU rules so the UK could negotiate as a “third country” with Brussels.“It is time for convinced Brexiters like me to compromise. So, at this late hour in the negotiations, we would like to make a new, generous offer to break the deadlock, to achieve a ‘no deal plus’. It would cost us money but it would finally dispel the ‘crash out’ Project Fear nightmare scenarios.”A government source said: “The end part of negotiations were always going to be tough. There are a number of issues that need to be worked through on the Northern Ireland backstop and these are the most difficult.“They include ensuring that, if it is ever needed, it is not permanent and there is a mechanism to ensure the UK could not be held in the arrangement indefinitely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/493935a8b45237441243aba26d369929200e5d95/0_1331_3280_1966/master/3280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=861dc10cd54ee05812b37d4ec22f2aa8","title":"dozens of cat mummies found in 6000 year old tombs in egypt","story":"An ancient unopened tomb and rare mummified scarab beetles were also unearthed at the site south of CairoDozens of cat mummies and a rare collection of mummified scarab beetles have been discovered in seven sarcophagi, some dating back more than 6,000 years, at a site on the edge of the pyramid complex in Saqqara, south of Cairo.Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Enany said the discovery was made by an Egyptian archaeological mission during excavation work started in April.Three of the tombs had been used for cats, he said, while one of four other sarcophagi discovered at the site was unopened. The tomb dates from the Fifth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom and is unusual because the facade and door are intact, meaning its contents may still be untouched, said Mohamed Youssef, director of the Saqqara area. He said experts plan to explore it in the coming weeks.Mostafa Waziri, head of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the mission had also unearthed the first mummies of scarabs to be found in the area.Two such mummies were found inside a rectangular limestone sarcophagus with a vaulted lid decorated with three scarabs painted in black, he said.Another collection of scarab mummies was found inside a smaller sarcophagus.“A couple of days ago, when we discovered those coffins, they were sealed coffins with drawings of scarabs. I never heard about them before.”Among the dozens of cat mummies unearthed were 100 wooden, gilded statues of cats and one in bronze dedicated to the cat goddess Bastet.Cats held a special place in ancient Egypt and were mummified as religious offerings.A collection of wooden, gilded statues of a lion, a cow and a falcon was also unearthed at the Saqqara site.The antiquities department also found painted wooden cobra and crocodile sarcophagi, a collection of gilded statues depicting animal features, as well as objects including amulets, canopic jars, writing tools and papyri baskets.Agence France-Presse and Reuters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcfbb5e6f4f613097e61d3c079cc5e168bf8fa10/77_143_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b7f2c4e9e97d3372343db50998d9d6d","title":"sports quiz week manchester city united f1 wayne rooney","story":"Who scored?

Tony Bellew lost his 34th and final fight here on Saturday night, stopped in the eighth round by one of the finest champions in boxing, Oleksandr Usyk.Curiously, it was probably Bellew’s most complete boxing performance in his 11 years as a professional, and it needed to be against Usyk, who arrived as the first undisputed cruiserweight champion since Evander Holyfield 30 years ago but the only one to hold these four belts. He left as the avenger of the last big Ukrainian to visit these shores, Wladimir Klitschko, and he might well be back. He would be more than welcome.“He’s a great big champion and I lost to a fine man,” the 35-year-old Bellew said in centre ring, to sustained applause. Usyk threw barely a blow in the first six minutes, while Bellew – the fittest of his 11-year career at just under the 14st 4lb limit – edged the first on workrate and landed heavy headshots in the second.The champion, egged on by his impatient challenger, came out of his southpaw shell in the third but paid for it with heavy Bellew counters over the top of his right lead. The Liverpudlian, a decent amateur himself, outboxed the Olympic gold medallist, to the astonishment of many ringside observers including Tommy Hearns.Bellew got the row he wanted in the fourth, stopping a stiff right then swinging back hard, sometimes wildly, and had Usyk under pressure near the bell, relaxed enough to showboat by resting on the ropes.There was both method and danger in Bellew’s game of cat-and-mouse but he oozed confidence, moving smartly and peppering the champion with body shots. As he added feints and double jabs to his attack, he looked far from the outclassed underdog, while Usyk, his matted hair cut short across his prominent brow, had the appearance of an archetypal eastern European Bond villain.Usyk was warming to his task as they got to the halfway stage, his jab now landing more frequently, but there was still no sign of his trademark assault and Bellew stole an otherwise close sixth with a late flurry.Usyk, needing to take more risks, kept rumbling forward with intent, but was wary of Bellew’s countering right, even when he trapped him in a neutral corner, and again he let the points slip.Bellew was blinking through the sweat at the start of the eighth and his energy level appeared to slip as he waited for one big shot, but found himself on the end of some major artillery, the last of which was a left hook he will only ever see on a replay. He dropped to the canvas like a stunned bull, and his longtime trainer and friend, David Coldwell, stepped in to comfort his man, a worthy loser who never gave anything less than his best.When smaller fighters approach or pass 30, they are caught between diminishing resources and lingering pride. For the 31-year-old former world champion Anthony Crolla, the prize for a unanimous points win over Daud Yordan (also 31) is a mandated challenge against the peerless and seemingly ageless Vasyl Lomachenko, who defends his WBA title next month against José Pedraza. So, for now at least, a rematch with the equally durable 35-year-old Scot Ricky Burns gets shuffled down Crolla’s list of priorities.Crolla’s 34th win was gruelling from start to finish, the Indonesian finishing strongly after early dominance by the home fighter. Three scores of 116-112 did not reflect the visitor’s effort or pedigree.Confirming there is no room for sentiment in the boxing business, Burns, the former three-weight world champion, earlier cut and stopped his compatriot and friend, 29-year-old Scott Cardle, in the third round of a non-title 10-rounder that could yet propel him back into title contention.The finishing right bounced off Cardle’s left shoulder, caught him flush and dumped him heavily. Bleeding and bruised around the left eye, Cardle, a late substitute for the injured Joe Cordina, looked in a sorry state when he rose on unsteady legs.Burns, who lost in this ring on points to Crolla just over a year ago in his 50th contest, continues to surprise with his resilience after 17 years as a pro. Whether he gets a fourth world title shot, though, is a tough call."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/668b25fc7a1c1ee0a0813c7daab028a754759481/375_17_3125_1875/master/3125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37e45220bf042e4d07dcde27ec319900","title":"sri lanka england cricket akila dananjaya suspect bowling action","story":"Sri Lanka’s off-spinner Akila Dananjaya was reported for a suspect bowling action during the first Test against England.The match officials’ report which was handed over to the Sri Lanka team management cited concerns about the 25-year-old’s action, which will be scrutinised further under the ICC process laid down for international cricket.Dananjaya is required to undergo testing within 14 days but he is permitted to continue bowling in international cricket until the results of the testing are known.The chances of Dananjaya being selected for the Kandy Test had already been reduced since he endured a wretched game in Galle, where he took two for 183 in the match while scoring only eight runs in his two innings.Definitely out of the remainder of the series is Sri Lanka’s captain Dinesh Chandimal because of a groin injury. Charith Asalanka, who scored an unbeaten half-century against England in a warm-up match, has been called up as a replacement.England, who arrived in Kandy in time to mark Armistice Day in the gardens of their hotel, have taken the unusual step of trimming their party in the middle of the tour. Ollie Pope, the 20-year-old batsman from Surrey, will leave Sri Lanka on Wednesday, the first day of the second Test match and head for Dubai. There he will join the Lions tour in the UAE and he will be available for the unofficial Test match against Pakistan A, which starts on 18 November, which is followed by five ODIs and two T20s.With Jonny Bairstow returning to fitness and Joe Denly also available the chances of Pope being required for the Test matches have dwindled to practically zero. So his imminent departure clearly makes sense. He will gain far more benefit from playing cricket in the UAE than batting in the nets and carrying drinks in Sri Lanka.“It is important that Ollie is playing and the selection panel felt that to aid his development the best course of action is for him to go and play for the Lions in a competitive series against Pakistan A,” said the head coach, Trevor Bayliss.“Ollie needs some game time before the West Indies Test tour early next year and will get more out of playing competitively for the Lions than spending the next three weeks on the sidelines. He will get the opportunity of playing up to eight matches across all formats in the UAE.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff2611bcdb7c31e6b2a5167b7c0c142a52d95c9c/0_320_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=980da4497cfaaaf410563383aeab556b","title":"nish kumar on my radar","story":"Born in Wandsworth, south London, in 1985, Nish Kumar got involved in comedy at Durham University, where he studied English and history. He embarked on his first solo tour, Who Is Nish Kumar?, in 2012, has appeared on numerous TV comedy shows, including Mock the Week and Taskmaster, and since 2017 has hosted BBC2’s The Mash Report. Kumar’s new show, It’s in Your Nature to Destroy Yourselves, tours the UK next year, from 25 Jan to 31 March.The album I’m listening to a lot is Room 25 by an American rapper called Noname. A couple of years ago she released Telefone, which a bunch of friends of mine who are, frankly, cooler recommended to me and I really loved it, so I was very excited about the follow-up. She’s got unbelievable vocal agility, and her themes embrace the complexity of the conversations we’re having now about race and gender and class, but it’s also a very personal, intimate and confessional album. It’s an extraordinary piece of work.I’m very excited about Widows. I loved 12 Years a Slave and Shame, but this is a complete departure for Steve McQueen. It looks like he has made a straight-up heist film – and the cast list is insane. I absolutely love a heist-gone-wrong movie. I love Heat and that kind of thing, and he seems to have hit that kind of tone. Viola Davis is just one of those actors who is never bad in anything. She could be in an awful film but you’d never come away from it saying she was bad.I’ve become a real evangelist for this mini-series. It was written by David Simon, directed by Paul Haggis, and it stars Oscar Isaac, Winona Ryder, Alfred Molina and Catherine Keener. When you say it, it sounds awful: a six-hour mini-series about housing in Yonkers in upstate New York, but it’s some of the most riveting television I have ever seen. I’m a touring standup comedian so a lot of the time I’m looking for box sets that I can put on my computer to pass the time on train journeys. I have far too much free time for an adult. The One Who Wrote Destiny by Nikesh ShuklaNikesh is a cultural godfather to many. A few years ago he assembled a bunch of us to write essays about first- and second-generation immigrant experience, in an anthology called The Good Immigrant. He’s a pillar of the community and now he has written this novel that is really wonderful, about three generations of the same family. It hops in and out of different time periods and has a really strong sense of character. Some sections are very personal and intimate, others are funnier and looser. It’s a really lovely book.I saw this at the National Theatre, and next year it goes on a big UK tour. It’s set in several barber shops around the world, and is an exploration of black masculinity. It’s one of the most innovatively put together things I’ve ever seen in the theatre. It’s interspersed with music from the region you’re about to head into, and it’s just really joyous. There’s a monologue towards the end about immigration and fathers that I found overwhelmingly moving. It’s got a beautiful ending."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/214d5f093b407bb5a0d76407b1b4594d2d6473d5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2c282e35bc78683111ea48dac28c9c7","title":"pinter three four review tamsin greig lee evans pinter theatre london","story":"Harold Pinter theatre, LondonGreig shows nothing is now beyond her range while Evans’s physical comedy is a delight as this short-drama season highlights Pinter’s fascination with marital solitudeJamie Lloyd’s six-month season of Pinter’s one-act plays is proving instructive and pleasurable. The opening programme reminded us of Pinter’s preoccupation with the roots of power. This new pairing demonstrates his fascination with marital solitude and capacity to write great parts for actors. Tamsin Greig, in Pinter Three, reveals an emotional range that suggests nothing in the classic or modern rep is now beyond her.Greig appears first in Landscape, from 1969 – Pinter’s study of a married couple, Beth and Duff, who seem to exist in separate worlds. Greig, speaking into a stand mic, employs a soft Irish lilt that intensifies Beth’s lyrical remembrance of past passion. Keith Allen as Duff, in Lloyd’s inventive production, hits a note of violent exasperation as he desperately tries to communicate with his detached wife.Greig is even more extraordinary as Deborah in A Kind of Alaska (1982), based on an Oliver Sacks case study. She combines the vocal register of a teenage girl with the terror of a woman returning to consciousness – and an unrecognisable world – after a 29-year sleep. But Lloyd’s production makes clear that the real tragedy lies in the irreparable gulf between the doctor who has lovingly tended her (Allen) and his estranged wife (a bleakly discomfited Meera Syal).Both these pieces leave one wrung through. Lee Evans brings idiosyncratic eccentricity, however, to some of the shorter pieces. In Monologue (1973), he plays a loner trapped in the present but feeding off an imagined past, brilliantly deploying perpetually sidelong glances and a body whose limbs seem to exist in a permanent state of civil war. Evans teams up with Tom Edden to hilarious effect in a famous revue sketch, Trouble in the Works (1959) as he itemises, with mounting despair, the workers’ revolt against the bronze draw-off cock “with or without handwheel”. Pinter Three is terrific.Many of the same themes recur in Pinter Four, comprising Moonlight (1993) and Night School (1960), but the effect is patchier. This is partly because Lyndsey Turner’s production of the former is a bit clunky. Moonlight captures well the sad strangeness of the marriage between a dying, scatological civil servant and his semi-detached wife, well played by Robert Glenister and Brid Brennan. But you never feel, as you should, that their estranged sons and ethereal daughter inhabit their own distinct, inviolable worlds.Night School, written for television, fares much better in Ed Stambollouian’s production. This is early funny-mysterious Pinter about a woman (a sprightly Jessica Barden) who effortlessly leads a dual life as schoolteacher and nightclub hostess. Pinter’s dialogue is sharply comic: Al Weaver, as the heroine’s besotted admirer, gazes at her, rapturously announcing: “Your eyes, they’re northern eyes. They’re full of soot.” A virtually unrecognisable Janie Dee gives a vivid study of one of Weaver’s aunts – a bustling spinster whose every look and stride seems to carry a hint of reproach.It is good to be reminded of Pinter’s gift for comedy. But the abiding impression of the two evenings is of Pinter’s periodic view of the marital state as, in Beckett’s words, “alone together, so much shared”.

The more senior members of the family have had their noses put seriously out of joint by some of the junior players in the clan. Leading the charge is the frighteningly precocious new A-Class. It sets a dizzyingly impressive benchmark for comfort and technology, not just in the more agile and dynamic compact classes but also for those larger, more docile range toppers.This baby Benz, first introduced more than 20 years ago, has always been a clever little swot, sucking up laboratory-fresh technologies and revelling in the breakthroughs before anyone else has even had a sniff of them. This latest version, however, has done all this with such wholesale gusto that it is, pound for pound, the safest, smartest, most advanced, most convenient and arguably one of the most desirable of all the Mercs. If you are thinking of splashing out a fortune on a luxury barge, you should first consider downsizing – and shifting up – to this A-Class. After all, it’s got everything, just in miniature.As the junior Benz has matured over the past two decades, it has grown into its looks. Or maybe we have become accustomed to the aesthetics of small and posh. Either way, it manages to be both modest and flashy.Step inside and you feel the game shift dramatically. The cabin is crisp, cool and chic. At the centre of the dash are three air vents that look like tiny turbines. Swooping out from both sides are LED ambient lighting strips (you can choose from a spectrum of 64 colours) and there’s an ocean of smooth leather and dimpled plastics to relish.In front of the driver, like a futuristic master computer, sits a huge dual digital display. I’ve never seen anything like it in such a compact car. It’s there to make use of the all-new MBUX (which stands for Mercedes-Benz User Experience) touchscreen infotainment system. This takes in-car connectivity into a new arena. It’s operated via the touchscreen, a finger touchpad on the centre console, touch-control buttons on the steering wheel, or voice control. This latter feature is activated with the words “Hey, Mercedes…” as in “Hey, Mercedes, could you direct me to the nearest McDonald’s?” or “Hey, Mercedes, how about some music?”Safety standards and driver aids are second to none. For the first time the A-Class is able to drive semi-autonomously in certain situations. Take your hands off the steering wheel on the motorway and you’ll find the car uses its radar to track the white lines and keep you centred. It will also keep you a safe distance behind the car in front, automatically adjusting its speed on bends, at junctions and on roundabouts. In cities it will apply the brakes if needed. It will also recognise an imminent rear-end collision. There won’t be much you can do to get out the way but it will squeeze the brakes thus minimising the risk of injuries by reducing the forward jolt caused by the impact.The satnav features augmented reality, which is also a completely revolutionary feature. A video image of your surroundings, taken with a front-facing camera, is supplemented by helpful navigation information. Arrows or house numbers, for example, are superimposed on to the screen making it easier for you to search for a certain house number, or to find the correct side road for turning off.Two new downsized four-cylinder engines, jointly developed with Daimler alliance partner Renault, are the entry-level options: a 114bhp 1.5-litre diesel powering the A180d, with CO2 emissions of just under 110gkm and a 161bhp 1.3-litre turbocharged petrol motor. Both come with front-wheel drive and seven-speed dual-clutch gearboxes, although manual will soon be available.Drive an A-Class and you’ll soon find yourself totally hooked…Rolling up the windows does little to protect you from the toxic air which many of us inhale when we sit in traffic jams. It’s has been shown that the air inside the car can be even more polluted than outside and research shows that exposure to pollution inside vehicles is the equivalent of passively smoking 180 cigarettes each year for the average driver or passenger who sits in traffic for just an hour a day.Marc Ottolini CEO of Airlabs, the manufacturer of airbubbl, said: “Whether you are a car commuter, a parent on the school run or someone who drives for a living, unfortunately you currently spend a great deal of time inside your car breathing in dangerous gases and pollutants on a daily basis. And for those with respiratory issues the problem is even more pronounced. We all recognise and are worried by the risks of active and passive smoking, but just being in a vehicle can be just as bad for your health. We want people to understand these risks and help them make the car a healthier environment.”The portable airbubbl features powerful patented airflow design and can be controlled via a mobile app that feeds back statistics on the amount of air that has been cleaned. It fastens behind the front car seat’s headrest and plugs into the car’s cigarette lighter. It sucks in polluted air that’s inside the car, traps nitrogen dioxide and other gases on a unique, patented, carbon filter and removes particulates.It costs £299.99 and is available from airbubbl and on Amazon.Email Martin at martin.love@observer or follow him on Twitter @MartinLove166"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/027774668281b0d4310ac7f1e2b4602a9b55295a/0_138_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ad565ca06cdfd36df2aefd07aa2c1df","title":"send a tip on independent tour guides for a chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tells us about engaging, amusing and knowledgeable tour guides the world over whose services you have enjoyedA good guide or local contact can make a crucial difference to your enjoyment of a trip, bringing a destination to life with their passion, storytelling and wit.

Oh, hello, Today in Focus, the ’s new flagship daily podcast! Launched just a few days after the Radio 4 Today programme’s new flagship daily podcast, Beyond Today, Today in Focus is trying to do a similar thing to Beyond Today. Meaning: it’s trying to be a British version of the New York Times’s flagship daily podcast, The Daily.Confused? It’s not so hard to understand. The Daily, which has been broadcasting since January 2017, offers an in-depth, insiders’ view of the NYT stories that are leading the news. Hosted by Michael Barbaro, an NYT political journalist, each podcast covers one story, with a small news roundup at the end. Episodes last around 20 minutes and there’s a buzzy, backroom feel: Barbaro talks to the journalist who is covering the story, often while they are actually covering it. The Daily has been a huge success, with over 5 million monthly listeners. Beyond Today (which I reviewed last week) and Today in Focus are attempts to make a British version of this.Luckily – for me, anyway – Today in Focus is very good. (Better than Beyond Today, though it seems a bit mean to judge on just a few episodes.) Anushka Asthana, the ’s former joint political editor, is the main presenter. Asthana has plenty of broadcast experience, having worked on Sky News, and her presenting is an excellent mix of relaxed and enquiring. So far, the stories covered have been on point: a report on new Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro the inevitable US midterms, with Gary Younge a look at the campaign for a second referendum on Brexit Britain’s role in the Yemen crisis what’s wrong with universal credit.I like the podcast’s easy flipping between national and international, and its ability to lay out the lead-up to a crisis, as well as the crisis itself. The explanations of Brazil, Yemen, and universal credit were compelling and made me understand why these situations have gone so badly wrong. I don’t mind the short opinion piece at the end (Georgina Lawton on who gets to identify as black, and naturalist Bernie Krause on changing natural soundscapes, were both excellent). The soundscaping is subtle and sophisticated, which is rare in UK news podcasts. As a news junkie, I’d quite like an extra “what else is going on in the news” feature. But that’s just a quibble. I have subscribed, and Today in Focus has replaced The Daily in my affections.Evan Davis is back presenting a news programme on Radio 4. His Newsnight experiment is over and he has taken over from Eddie Mair as host of PM. Well, hooray to that. Davis – like Mair – is good on TV, but better on radio, warm and funny. He’s also much better in a late afternoon slot than either early morning or late night, and I enjoyed his “these are the questions we would have asked the government minister about council cuts, had one come on the show” section on Tuesday (very PM!). Davis will have to up his empathy a little to get the amazing real-life interviews that Mair did, but he has had a great start.Just room for a spot of Mark Kermode. The busiest man in film (and this paper’s lead film critic) has released another show, a podcast, to join his excellent BBC Four TV series, Secrets of Cinema his live BFI show, MK3D and his long-living, multi-award-winning 5 Live podcast, Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review. (Will this show have to end once Simon Mayo is snapped up by a non-BBC radio station?)The three episodes of Kermode on Film out so far showcase what we can expect: the first features a lively review section with younger film buff Jack Howard, plus a few clips from MK3D second, a straightforward recording of MK3D with Hayley Squires, Mike Leigh and Hugh Grant third, a walk around Belfast with David Holmes, plus another recording of Kermode’s live interview with Desiree Akhavan. I’d like a little more care with the sound production and editing (you can barely hear Kermode in the first show) and a few more podcast-only bits (Hell’s Video Store is fun), but he is great value, as ever.Making ObamaiTunesIf you’re missing the 44th president, then immerse yourself in this six-parter from WBEZ. Released this year, Making Obama covers his early career in Chicago (WBEZ is a Chicago station), from 1985 to 2004. Though he’s now almost mythologised, due to the contrast with thug Thump, what’s interesting is how imperfect Obama was, how often he pitched things wrongly. “We had a fundraiser for him in this apartment,” says one contributor. “And, I must say, he was terrible.” Oral testimonies and some nice sound touches make this podcast series skip along.Thirst Aid KitPlayerFMThis podcast does make me laugh. Hosted by BuzzFeed’s Bim Adewunmi (British) and Nichole Perkins (American), it’s about unabashed, guilt-free lust (“thirst”). The show uses pop culture to examine female desire, so our hosts get to chat about who they fancy and then wonder why they do so. How do women’s histories, politics and economics affect who makes us hot? (Both women are straight, cis and black.) Redacted, their short fan-fiction stories in which the listener is invited to imagine what happens next, are sweet and hilarious. Recommended.Hands UpbbcI stumbled across this on Radio 4 last week, and it stopped me in my tracks. Six plays written by black male American playwrights, aged between 30 and 40, Hands Up started as part of a New York theatre festival, the New Black Fest. The plays are a direct response to the events in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, when 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead by a white police officer. They are linked by comments from young black men interviewed in New York City, Chicago and St Louis.

We gave them to Saudi Arabia, to the United States, Germans, French and British, all of them. They have listened to all the conversations in them. They know,” Erdoğan said.The CIA director, Gina Haspel, heard an audio recording of Khashoggi’s death when she visited Istanbul, two sources told Reuters last month. A senior Saudi envoy was also played a recording, a source familiar with the matter said. Erdoğan did not give details of the contents of the tapes on Saturday but two sources with knowledge of the issue have told Reuters that Turkey has several audio recordings.They include the killing itself and conversations pre-dating the operation that Turkey subsequently uncovered, the sources said. These had led Ankara to conclude from an early stage that the killing was premeditated, despite Saudi Arabia’s initial denials of any knowledge or involvement.Saudi Arabia’s prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb has since said Khashoggi’s killing was planned in advance, although another Saudi official said Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the specific operation.

When Italy finally emerged from its crushing triple-dip recession in 2015, Brescia, an important European industrial hub some 50 miles east of Milan, enjoyed uninterrupted growth.But business leaders argue that the budget contains little to spur growth and investment, and will instead lead to an economy based on “handouts”.Pasini said it would also diminish a programme introduced by the previous centre-left government known as Industry 4.0, which is credited with enabling companies to expand and compete in global markets: it provided tax incentives for innovation, training and the purchase of new machinery.Giordano Riello, the founder of three electronics companies in the Veneto region, who has benefited from the programme, said the coalition government lacked long-term economic vision.“What we need is investment in infrastructure, factories and materials … not giveaways to make people happy for only a brief time,” he said. “I’m really afraid to invest in my country right now as there is no future vision. All we have is populism, and you don’t develop with populism.”There are warnings that measures including the so-called dignity decree, introduced in July by the M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, to curtail temporary job contracts and penalise companies that shift production abroad, could have the opposite effect.“The labour market decree makes it much harder to hire temporary workers, yet such contracts are a crucial part of employment,” said Francesco Giavazzi, an economics professor at Milan’s Bocconi University. “As for taxing companies for delocalisation – modern firms try to optimise the value chain by building firms around the world. If you don’t allow them to do that, they will move everything abroad.” The move to lower the retirement age was aimed at making more jobs available to young people, but companies might instead use it as an excuse to reduce labour costs, Giavazzi added.Licia Mattioli, chief executive of the jewellery company Mattioli and a vice-president at Confindustria, the confederation of Italian industry, said the slowing economy was a result of uncertainty as well as anxiety over the costs of servicing the country’s debts.She also criticised the budget for lacking a clear investment strategy, especially for much-needed infrastructure projects. The coalition partners, for instance, are currently locked in battle over TAV, a high-speed rail project linking Italy and France that M5S opposes and the League supports. Mattioli is worried about it being cancelled: “Not only will it mean €9bn worth of investment for our country, but it gives us a high-speed link to Europe.”The looming budget standoff also poses an acute dilemma for the European commission,  of EU law, which rejected Italy’s draft spending plans in a historic moment last month. For long-serving EU officials, the power to reject the budget of the third-largest economy of the eurozone makes a lot of sense – until it actually has to be used.The commission is seen to be in a lose-lose situation: if it rejects the budget again, officials fear it will provide ammunition for the League’s anti-EU crusade being led by the deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini. But allowing the plans to pass would send a message that the EU’s common-currency rules do not matter.The decision to let France and Germany off the hook in 2003 for breaking the eurozone’s fiscal pact is judged to have been a hugely damaging mistake that poisoned relations between large and small eurozone members. So far, the other 18 members of the eurozone have backed the commission against Italy, but that has done nothing to ease the wrangling.In front of the cameras, EU ministers and officials have taken a softly-softly approach, but behind the scenes there is anger about Rome’s spending plans. One senior European source said the fight with the EU was political, and accused Italy’s government of misleading its public by suggesting economic bounty was around the corner.Italy’s budget “is not only a mistake, it is a lie”, the source said. “What Salvini wants to prove is that he is not sticking to the rules.” The source believes the Italian government is seeking to emulate the economic policy of the US, but that it lacks America’s structural economic strengths, such as high productivity and high employment rates.The EU’s Rome-watchers take little comfort from the fact that Italy’s rising bond yields may prove a more effective sanction than decisions by Brussels technocrats. “You can get away with a crisis until the moment the markets say enough is enough,” said a senior EU official.As crunch time approaches, Pasini is urging Italian leaders to take heed of business concerns. “Firstly, Europe is essential for Italy and its industry. I hope our politicians understand this and that we don’t reach a point where the country becomes isolated,” he said. “Secondly, we hope they modify some of this budget.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9934d1ade56d015dd81df94c1389e788efad06c/0_129_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bda139652084421743f2a8ee76bbbed","title":"irom sharmila love story worlds longest hunger strike","story":"Journalists from around the world watched expectantly. Irom Sharmila peered at the smear of honey in her hand. Her face was twisted in anguish. She wept. Then, with a glance at the sky, she scooped a finger of honey on to her tongue.And that was how it ended. On a cloudy morning in August 2016, in Imphal, the capital of the northeastern Indian state of Manipur, the world’s longest hunger strike was over. Sharmila had eaten for the first time in nearly 16 years.A martyr had come back to life.A slight, pale woman with unruly dark hair, Sharmila had last voluntarily eaten on 4 November 2000. That afternoon she had settled by a pond, in a meadow of banyan and bamboo, with two packets of pastries, “filling my stomach to my heart’s content”, she says.The state around was seething. Manipur, a violent, ided former kingdom on the border with Myanmar, is riven by ethnic and anti-Indian insurgencies. It is one of a handful of Indian states subject to a colonial-era law known as the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, or Afspa, which grants virtual immunity from prosecution to Indian military stationed there.The results are predictable. “It has created a new category of Indian citizens who are killable people, rape-able women,” says Babloo Loitongbam, a human rights activist and lawyer. “We have concrete records of at least 1,528 extrajudicial executions of civilians over the space of 33 years. And this is just the tip of the iceberg.”Over the 5,574 days she fasted to demand the law be abolished – force-fed through a nasal tube and imprisoned in an Indian government hospital – Sharmila became the face of the struggle against Afspa. She was lavished with international prizes, awarded thousands of dollars and declared a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. Her poster adorned homes across the state. “We thought if things went well she could be the first Nobel laureate from Manipur,” Loitongbam says.Yet now, Sharmila, 46, has become an outcast in her home state. The same activists who praised her as a goddess now call her a prostitute, she says. She has accused them of “acting like the Taliban”.“She has created a big joke out of herself, which not only destroyed her as a persona, but destroyed our movement, and it has taken us a long time to recover,” Loitongbam says.With a lick of honey that day in Imphal, she chose to give up sainthood. She was sick of being worshipped. She no longer believed in fasting. Maybe worst of all – in the eyes of many supporters – Sharmila had fallen in love.On 2 November 2000, a makeshift bomb exploded close to an army convoy passing a bus stop in Malom, in Imphal’s west district. The soldiers claimed the bomb was followed by gunshots and they returned fire. None of the troops was hit – a judge would later decide there was no evidence anyone had shot at them – but when the firing ceased, 10 Manipuri civilians were dead.Sharmila, then 28, was working as an intern with Loitongbam’s human rights group. She helped to document cases of alleged abuse by Indian soldiers, interviewing women who had survived gang rapes, and the parents and children of slain civilians.Her family had been poor and she had struggled to finish high school. But she had what she calls a “gift from God”: an overwhelming sense of duty that compelled her to find a way to fight injustice. She learned of the so-called Malom massacre the day after the shootings, when images of the victims’ bloody bodies were printed on the front of newspapers.“Seeing that, I felt the futility and uselessness of holding another rally, just shouting,” she says. “That was how I decided. I thought people would follow me like Gandhi’s independence struggle. I just felt I wouldn’t die.”On 5 November, Sharmila sat under a shelter near the site of the killings with a placard, announcing she was fasting until Afspa was repealed. A crowd quickly formed around her.“Before sunset, people were sitting with me,” she recalls. “But a little later, they all, one after another, excused themselves and left me behind.”The announcement that one of his interns had stopped eating came as a shock to Loitongbam, a lawyer trained at one of India’s top universities in Delhi. “Honestly, my first suggestion to her was, no, don’t do this,” he recalls. “It’s too big an issue for you to handle. Repealing Afspa is very big. Let’s choose something more strategic.“But she said no, I’ve got my mother’s blessing – and she jumped into it.”Even at that stage, Sharmila says, misgivings were creeping into her mind. She recalls observing the crowd in Malom in the first days of the fast. “It was like a street show or a circus,” she says. “They gathered on the road in the thousands – gossiping, laughing, criticising.“I felt like the people were due to awaken,” she adds. “I would just tolerate until then.”The first time Sharmila was force-fed was around 10 November 2000, about six days after her last voluntary meal, and soon after she had been arrested and charged with the crime of attempting suicide.At first she tried to resist the feeding tube. “But I convinced myself it was futile,” she says. “My position was like a bird who had shattered her wings.” Though the prison manual required force-feeding through the mouth, she persuaded the doctor to use a nasal tube instead. If she was force-fed through her nose, she reasoned, she was holding to her promise not to eat until Afspa was repealed.And so, several times a day for the next 16 years, Sharmila was kept alive by a mash of nutrients and water pumped through a a three-feet tube between her nose and stomach.Manipuris were initially baffled, Loitongbam says. “Honestly, at first it was a joke. People asked, how can this girl from the middle of nowhere be doing this? Me, my organisation, her family members worked hard to establish her.”Indian authorities could detain Sharmila for one year at a time: the length of the penalty for attempting suicide. When the year was up,she would be released, start fasting again, and promptly be rearrested and returned to isolation in her ward at Imphal’s Jawaharlal Nehru hospital.Outside, Manipur continued to boil. On 10 July 2004, a young woman named Thangjam Manorama was dragged from her home by Indian soldiers. “Mother, mother, please stop them,” her family say she screamed as she was taken away.A judicial inquiry later found that Manorama was tortured and her body dumped near a police station with 16 bullet wounds. Nobody was charged the soldiers invoked Afspa.Outrage after the murder paralysed Manipur for months and turned Sharmila into a hero. “The fact she had continued fasting for four years hit the psyche of the people,” Loitongbam says. “From 2004 onwards, she was a leader. She became the symbol – for better or worse – of the Manipur resistance.”In her guarded ward, Sharmila occupied herself with passing the endless time alone. She wrote poetry. She rose in the middle of the night to walk in circles in the corridors. She held yoga positions for hours.She fought the maddening dryness of her mouth – having also eschewed water – by sucking cotton balls to keep saliva flowing.“I really loved life,” she says. “Just because of that love, those long years of endurance were possible.”She awaited the day Manipuris would be inspired by her strike to organise, shed their isions and force the government to repeal the military special powers act. Then she could get on with a normal existence.“This kind of living with nasal feeding, just observing day and night and getting all that blind fame – I just knew this was not life,” she says.Yet as her aura grew, Sharmila felt like this goal was becoming more distant. “People just started praising my glory without listening to what I wanted from them,” she says.“That prolonged sense of responsibility and commitment was left to me alone. It needed to be a collective cause, a mass cause.“I was isolated and idolised, living on a pedestal, without voice, without feeling,” she says.At the peak of her powers, Sharmila was being sought out by Nobel laureates and diplomats. She was called the Iron Lady of Manipur. She was miserable.Early in 2007, a British-Indian named Desmond Coutinho arrived in the country. His mother had just died from cancer, and the west Londoner was questioning his life. “I was always half-training to do something but never got anywhere,” he says.So a friend suggested Coutinho, now 55, follow in the footsteps of generations of listless westerners and go to India to find himself.“He said, for the first time in your life, Dessie, you won’t feel out of place, because you won’t be the shortest person there and you’ll be the same colour as everyone else.”He eventually settled in the south Indian city of Bangalore, where one morning, he saw a newspaper story about a hunger striker in Manipur.“I remember seeing this tiny woman on the bed,” Coutinho says. “I thought of the way my mother died. He says: “The story sounded horrific, and at the end she said she liked reading books, but she wasn’t always given some.”So Coutinho started sending her letters, along with two books. About three months later, Sharmila replied. “It was a bit of a stroppy letter,” he recalls. Sharmila was keener to interrogate the crimes of imperial Britain than to flirt. “She wrote, ‘It’s all well and good to admire me, Mr Coutinho, but why is it right to send your mercenaries throughout the world?’”He recalls: “I replied saying, whoa – I personally do not send any mercenaries anywhere.”Over the next months they kept exchanging letters, and Coutinho kept sending her books. She liked PG Wodehouse. She disliked a book of essays about postmodernist economics. (“I toned down my choices,” Coutinho says.) Her favourite was a biography of Ingrid Betancourt, the French-Colombian activist held hostage by guerrillas for six years.Coutinho was smitten by Sharmila, and sizing up the hurdle before him: how to signal to a woman he had never met – a woman engaged in the world’s longest hunger strike – that he was keen to start a relationship.Sharmila finally made the move. “She wrote a very sweet letter, saying please forgive me if I’ve misunderstood, and if I’m wrong, please don’t hurt me,” he says. “I went to one of the local stores and looked for the biggest Valentine’s card I could find. Something over the top, so there could be no misunderstanding.”Sharmila reminded him she was not free. Did he want this commitment? A relationship with a prisoner, isolated in a hospital ward?“So I said in return, I will no longer be free,” he says. “I will not write to anyone but you.”“To me, the problem started when Coutinho walked into her life,” says Loitongbam. “Manipuri society is traditional, and there is a certain way courtship should take place.”Coutinho’s arrival in Manipur in 2011 shook up the anti-Afspa movement. The group of activist mothers who had surrounded Sharmila strenuously objected to the partnership. So did members of her own family.For Sharmila, the reactions fuelled a sense of resentment towards the campaigners around her. “Even though I was on a hunger strike, I still cherished family life, living with a life partner. My inner being was dreaming of these things.”She continued her annual cycle of release, starvation and arrest, but her doubts were growing, and she prayed for guidance. “Always I was complaining to God: ‘Are you not finished experimenting with me? Is it not enough yet?’” she says.In July 2016 she shocked the country and her supporters by abruptly announcing an end date to her fast. “Nothing had changed in people’s mindsets after 16 years,” she says. “I really wanted to change myself, the environment, the tactics, everything.”Instead, Sharmila said, she would marry Coutinho and continue her struggle by running for Manipur’s parliament.To Loitongbam, the plan was hopelessly naive. Democracy in India can be grubby most citizens still vote along caste or religious lines, and votes are brazenly traded for money or gifts. It is no place for saints.“I told her, Sharmila, you are like uranium, you have enormous spiritual power,” he says. “But just as you need technology to convert his uranium into atomic energy, you need a whole infrastructure behind you. Without it you cannot convert spiritual energy into political power. But she just didn’t listen.”The activist mothers around Sharmila were incensed by her decision. “In their imaginations I had already been sacrificed,” Sharmila says.“They said I wanted to leave to get married, get a husband that I was a whore.”One Manipuri militant group issued a statement warning Sharmila “some former revolutionary leaders were assassinated” after deviating from a radical path.Nobody offered to take her in: she spent her first weeks of freedom in the same hospital ward she had been imprisoned inside for more than a decade and a half.The election, held in March 2017, was a disaster. Sharmila ran against the state’s most prominent politician. She won 90 votes. Two days after the result was announced, she boarded a flight out of Manipur.Today, Sharmila lives in an apartment on the outskirts of Bangalore. She and Coutinho recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary. They went to the Taj Mahal. A picture of the pair is framed in their home, near a shelf of awards that Sharmila has accumulated, and a rare statue of a starving Buddha.Eating again is a pleasure, she says. Everything is tastier since the fast. “That first drop of honey was bitter, so caustic,” she recalls. “The taste spread throughout my whole body.”Hours later, beyond the glare of the cameras, she tried to drink an ounce of coconut juice – and immediately threw it up. It took her months to hold down a full meal.Sharmila has never returned to Manipur. She is unsure if she would be welcome. I ask if she is finally at peace. “I think so,” she says. “No more bondage, controlling by others all the time. That sense of freedom, my own view, reaching out to the farthest point.”“What else could we have done?” Loitongbam says ruefully. “The only service we could do was to build her image higher and push for the repeal of Afspa.“Our mistake was that we eulogised her so much,” he concludes. “She didn’t want to be a god. She wanted to be a human.”October 2000 Joins Human Rights Alert as an intern.November 2000 Begins a hunger strike to protest against the Malom massacre, in which 10 civilians were shot dead by a paramilitary unit while waiting at a bus stop.2007 Awarded the South Korean Gwangju prize for human rights.2009 Awarded the first Mayilamma award for her “non-violent struggle in Manipur”.2010 Wins a lifetime achievement award from the Asian Human Rights Commission, followed by the Rabindranath Tagore peace prize from the Indian Institute of Planning and Management.2013 Amnesty International declares her a prisoner of conscience.August 2016 Ends her 16-year fast and announces she will stand in Manipur’s state elections.

Its organisers include the National Radical Camp (ONR), a marginal group with roots in an anti-Semitic pre-World War II movement.In a bid to avoid a similar debacle on the centenary, the rightwing Law and Justice (PiS) government and allied President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday announced the state military parade, insisting that it had legal priority.But the far-right groups refused to back down after a court overruled a separate ban imposed by the Warsaw mayor citing the risk of violence and hate speech.The PiS government spent Friday in a tug of war over the scheduling of the two events. The sides confirmed late Friday that they would coincide.The US, Canadian and Ukrainian embassies issued warnings about the possibility of violence in connection with the march, while many Poles have expressed dismay.“When the Polish government has to negotiate with far-right groups on the centenary it shows the weakness of the state,” Wojciech, a 67-year-old Warsaw cabbie who declined to provide his surname, said. “It’s very sad and disappointing.”Underscoring Poland’s growing isolation in the European Union since the PiS took office in 2015, no senior delegations from fellow EU states are due to attend the centenary, which coincides with the Armistice centenary.The government has put Poland on a collision course with the EU by introducing a string of controversial judicial reforms that Brussels has warned pose a threat to judicial independence, the rule of law and ultimately to democracy.EU President Donald Tusk, a former liberal Polish prime minister, was the bloc’s only senior representative in Warsaw on Sunday and his visit comes amid speculation that he may return to run for president in 2020.“Forgive us Poland ... we love you,” Tusk said, urging national unity early Sunday, remarking that Poles “sometimes argue too much” about their country as he laid flowers at the statue of independence leader Marshal Jozef Pilsudski in Warsaw.Speaking on Saturday, Tusk likened the PiS to “contemporary Bolsheviks” who must be “defeated”.He also repeated a warning that the PiS could unwittingly unleash a “Polexit” from the EU despite its strong popularity among Poles and the many assurances of PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski that his party has no such designs.Widely regarded as Poland’s de facto powerbroker, Kaczynski has played a key role behind the scenes in shaping domestic and foreign policy. He and Tusk are arch-rivals.Poles will pause nationwide at the stroke of noon on Sunday to sing the national anthem. It will be a rare show of unity in the EU and Nato country of 38 million people that has become increasingly polarised under the PiS.While robust economic growth along with the government’s generous social welfare measures and conservative stance have garnered it support mainly in rural areas, judicial reforms have sparked outrage among urban centrists and liberals.But Norman Davies, an Oxford historian and a renowned authority on Poland, insists that despite the recent turmoil “Poles have never had it so good”.Before November 1918, Poland did not exist at all for 123 years, carved up between the Prussian, Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fedbadad2f4cb0e61f2322420ea0d09670381d6/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c0efd9e9c6b5064772e89209238fd3d","title":"the secret lives of trees what to expect in autumn","story":"It’s the season to get lost in beautiful shades of reds, yellows and oranges – but do you know the science behind these vibrant displays, or the role fungi play in the season?“The trees are in their autumn beauty,” wrote the Irish poet William Butler Yeats. “The woodland paths are dry.” Immersed in rich colour and deliciously crunchy underfoot, a woodland walk in autumn is surely one of the most pleasurable and relaxing activities offered by the British countryside.Yet, those excursions are not always quite as straightforward as they appear. For one thing, British trees are rather complicated in their leaf-shedding habits and really vary according to location – autumn takes a while to arrive across the whole country.In the Scottish Highlands, for instance, the woods of the glens are already steeped in golden yellow as early as mid-September. Their canopies are also susceptible to immediate demolition should an early Atlantic storm pass through.In Derbyshire, many woods can often be cleared of vegetation by late October – yet, at the same date in Norfolk, which is more than 300 metres lower in altitude, there are oakwoods looking as emerald green as they did in midsummer. Come November, many trees seem to have barely cast a leaf.Another interesting thing about that leisurely autumn stroll is the environmental intensity that underpins it. Poet John Keats may have famously called it the “season of mists and mellow fruitfulness”, but it is anything but. What really drives those glorious colours in the trees is the stress of hard work.The element of almost all plants responsible for making summer so green is chlorophyll. But as well as being the miracle worker that turns sunlight to sugar during photosynthesis, chlorophyll is also a precious protein. Before they shed their leaves at the end of season, deciduous trees devote themselves to breaking it down and storing it away for another year.Sugar also plays a part in one of autumn’s most dramatic changes. It reacts with proteins in leaf cells to produce an antioxidant called anthocyanin. It is this red-pigmented agent that supplies the slow-burning glow of British woods. Ironically, the more stressed the trees are, the richer those reds seem to be. Autumn foliage is often more intense, for example, after sharp frosts.Of course, there’s more to the season’s full palate of colour. When you think of the lemon and burnt-biscuit fingers, say, of horse chestnuts, or the dull copper carpet that covers the floor of a December oakwood, those browns and yellows are what happens when a tree’s foliage loses all its chlorophyll.But what really makes autumn such a spectacle is that all these extraordinary colours occur together: so you might get the crimson of London planes colliding with the emerald of holly and ivy, or the scarlet berries of hawthorn and dog rose at the same time as the infinite earth tones of toadstools.Mushrooms may be the most modest player in this infinity of colour, but they supply the other great engine of autumnal change. It is the season when we get to see the extraordinary fruiting bodies, the so-called “toadstools” of fungi. It seems more than coincidence that these bizarre organisms are substantially made from the same stuff as insects – chitin – because, like insects, they have a gift for unexpected appearance. Suddenly they bulb up among tree roots, or emerge out of the heartwood like some chest-bursting creature from Ridley Scott’s Alien.These are the parts that digest the organism’s vegetable diet and then traffic it through the woodland floor. They also play a part in the development and maintenance of the canopy, because fungi in woods forge essential partnerships, whereby the roots of the trees interconnect with what are called mycorrhizal fungi. This link between trees and fungi enables them to share vital nutrients.In a single kilo of woodland soil there can be six miles of hyphae. Beneath an inidual wood, there will be many millions of miles of these fungal networks, and they are at the heart of the extraordinary demolition procedure that is at autumn.Without fungi, the world would be buried in this vegetable junk and life would stagnate for the lack of carbon dioxide.So next time you stroll along a woodland path in autumn with trees changing colour, remember that it’s these incredible underlying, unseen essentials that make everything around us possible."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684184.1541167032!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no more buck passing or dithering dublin needs a new boss","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIllustration: Fuchsia MacAreeThere’s a classic trope in horror films where the protagonist sets aside the norms of rational behaviour and goes down into an unlit cellar, or gets into a car with an obviously unhinged stranger, while the audience can see the terrible event about to unfold and are willing the victim to retreat.It’s a feeling that will be familiar to any long-time observer of Dublin local authority proceedings. Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Government to back roles in third level institutions at cost of \u0026euro6 millionCentenary of first World War ending a \u0026lsquostark reminder\u0026rsquo of importance of co-operation \u0026ndash VaradkarPedestrian pronounced dead at scene of incident in Ballinasloe on Saturday eveningVeteran activist says migrants in panic and fear over where they will stand post-BrexitEvent to mark 50th anniversary of civil rights movement hears key issues unchangedFile to be prepared for Director of Public Prosecutions while investigation continuesMinister for Agriculture Michael Creed pays tribute to work of organisationWoman in her 70s thrown to the ground and her husband grabbed by the throatTom Kettle and Willie Redmond among 26 barristers who died in WW1D\u0026rsquoArcy says high cost of insurance due to large court payouts is \u0026lsquohuge societal issue\u0026rsquoGreen Party legislation would help 500 Bord na M\u0026oacutena workers set to lose jobs in midlandsMartin Doyle will be remembered by the British government with a paving stoneNew book detailing lives in the midst of Dublin\u0026rsquos housing crisis in releasedDetectives recover cannabis resin, cannabis herb, cocaine and ecstasy in Passage WestFlammable liquid was poured through letterbox of front door of house in East BelfastDispute between the NI Police Ombudsman and Durham Constabulary has deepenedAfricans \u0026lsquothe most disadvantaged\u0026rsquo group in the Irish labour market, according to ESRIGalway events will commemorate 1,400 men from county who died in WWIJulie O\u0026rsquoReilly becomes 19th woman caught up in CervicalCheck controversy to dieMay\u0026rsquos letter \u0026lsquoraises alarm bells\u0026rsquo for those who value the integrity of the union, says Foster"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3693956.1541938737!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"president recognises our common humanity as he marks armistice","story":"Two thirds of UCD students and staff who served in the first World War had backgrounds in medicine, and took up medical rather than combat roles. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins lays a wreath in Glasnevin Cemetery during the Armistice commemoration today. Photograph: Aidan CrawleyPresident Elect Michael D Higgins has led the State commemoration at Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin to mark the centenary of the ending in 1918 of the First World War.Relatives of some of the tens of thousands of Irish soldiers who fought and died in the war, joined members of the Government, members of the diplomatic corps from 47 countries and military veterans . The President said they had assembled to remember the 14 million who died in the great conflagration that lasted 1,564 days, represented the collision of empires and was one of two wars that “disfigured a century”.Earlier Minister for Culture and Heritage Josepha Madigan led a ceremony in which Victoria Cross commemorative plaques were unveiled, honouring five Irish soldiers who fought in the war, from Antrim, Down, Dublin, Wicklow and Sligo.The Victoria Cross is the most prestigious British military honour, awarded for gallantry “in the presence of the enemy”.During the two part ceremony war poems were read by French ambassador Stéphane Crouzet, British ambassador Robin Barnett, US Chargé d’Affaires Reece Smyth and German ambassador Deike Potzel. In his address Mr Higgins said “ours is not a celebration of militarism, nor a valorisation of martial spirit, but a simple recognition of our common humanity, as we recall the destruction of the promise and potential of a generation in the First World War” and the lasting damage inflicted on the millions wounded and maimed.They remembered the 200,000 men from across all Ireland “and we call to mind in a special way the tens of thousands who never returned home who remain forever in the soil of Belgium, France, Greece and Turkey”, he said.Citing reasons for participating, he said they were not driven by a single political aspiration, but some fought for the rights of small nations, some in defence of the United Kingdom and the Union, some for adventure, while others were compelled by economic necessity in a country still feeling the aftershocks of the Lockout of 1913. But they were united by a shared experience of war.Afterwards in Ireland for many years, “there was an uncertainty, even a reticence, to recognise the human reality of the First World War, and those who fought and died in it. “In our public history, the reticence was reflected by a form of official amnesia that left a blank space in our public memory,” he said.But now citizens across the island had begun to discover a greater insight in the experience of relatives and neighbours. “With this excavation of the past we have a far greater understanding of the motivation of those who enlisted in the war effort, and a better appreciation of the experience of the war, not only for those in uniform, but for civilians.” Mr Higgins said Ireland remembered the war dead in a spirit of solidarity and compassion, but in a world still sadly subject to war and the rumours of war.He quoted Martin Luther King as he said it was a world that still seemed “gone mad on war”, a world “in which, more than at any other time, so many people are subject to atrocities, to famine, to starvation and to displacement and exile”.Despite the 21st century capacity to abolish poverty and alleviate suffering “we are still devoting so much of our creativity, not to the preservation or achievement of peace, but to the prosecution of and preparation for war”. He said “some nations now seek to embark upon a new arms race, increasing not only their own stockpiles, but exporting weapons of death and destruction to fuel the fires of war in other lands, in Yemen, in Syria, and in the Democratic Republic of Congo”. Mr Higgins said that solidarity amongst peoples and nations is “not only a moral necessity, but that it is fragile and that it must be asserted again and again as our shared aspiration”. Peace could only be established and sustained peace will only ever be established, and sustained “when it is based upon the principles of justice, dignity and mutual respect”.He called for a “resolve to build, together, a more just and equal world, free from the terrors of war”. President Higgins laid a laurel wreath on behalf of the People of Ireland.Ambassadors from across the world laid wreaths, followed by Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces Vice- Admiral Mark Mellett.Poppy wreaths are laid by a number of military representative groups including the Royal British Legion, Republic of Ireland branch.A minute’s silence was observed to mark the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month (11 am on November 11th, 1918) when the Armistice was formally declared and the war ended.A sole piper played the lament and then the Last post was played and the national flag was raised to full mast, before the Reveille was played and then the national anthem.Ms Madigan said commemorations that are inclusive and seek to strengthen peace and reconciliation show maturity and understanding on the shared history of the island of Ireland, .Ms Madigan quoted DUP MP Geoffrey Donaldson,chairman of Northern Ireland centenary committee, who said ‘this is our shared history’ and remembering the men and women from both traditions who fought and fell in the war should not be a point of isiveness.Following the interactions and discussions and commemorations of the past few years relationships had been built“No one’s unionism or nationalism is diminished as a result,” she quoted.Ms Madigan unveiled the commemorative Victoria Cross plaque for Private Martin Moffatt of the Leinster Regiment.The Victoria Cross is the highest British military honour for bravery “in the presence of the enemy”.Second Lieutenant Edmund de Wind, Royal Irish Rifles, Private Claude Nunney, Canadian ExpeditionaryForce , CSM Martin Doyle, Royal Munster Fusiliers, Private James Crichton New Zealand Expeditionary Force were also honoured with Victoria Cross commemorative plaques at the first World War memorial in the cemetery.Meanwhile Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is among more than 70 heads of state and government are expected to attend the Armistice Day Commemoration at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris .The anniversary of the Armistice which ended the first World War serves as a “stark reminder” of the importance of European and international co-operation, Mr Varadkar has said.Speaking about the ceremony, Mr Varadkar will say he is “honoured” to represent the Republic.“I am honoured to represent Ireland at this commemorative event, which marks the end of hostilities in what was one of the greatest tragedies in world history,” he said.“I will stand in memory of the more than 200,000 Irishmen who fought in the conflict and the many Irishwomen who witnessed the horrors of war and worked courageously to save lives.“Tens of thousands of Irishmen, many of them only in their teens, were killed. Those who did survive returned to a changed Ireland, unable to share their horrific experiences.”Mr Varadkar said that throughout this decade of centenaries, the stories of fallen Irish soldiers have been shared. “We have rightly honoured the enormous sacrifice made by those who went to the front,” he said.“In the words of Thomas Kettle, we honour those who died not for flag, nor king, nor emperor – but for a dream, born in a herdsman’s shed, and for the secret scripture of the poor.“The anniversary of the Armistice serves as a stark reminder of the importance of European and international co-operation.“As we face new challenges in the 21st century, we need to work together to achieve peace, stability and prosperity across the world.“Through our committed and active membership of the EU and the UN, Ireland will continue to play a leading role in these efforts.”There will also be ceremonies in Enniskillen, the Co Fermanagh town which was the first on the island to proclaim the Armistice in 1918. St Michael’s Catholic Church in Enniskillen is to take an active part in events there on Sunday.Parish priest Msgr Peter O’Reilly will attend a ceremony at 6am at Enniskillen Castle, where special lamps will be presented to each church.He will also take part in a prayer service at the war memorial in Belmore Street just before the 11am Service of Remembrance in St Macartin’s (Church of Ireland) Cathedral."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3693888.1541882757!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tsunami of the vulnerable worried over brexit impact mcaliskey","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Bernadette McAliskey, migrant rights campaigner and a speaker at the We Shall Overcome seminar,  at Liberty Hall, Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Brexit is causing panic and fear in Northern Ireland, particularly among immigrants trying to figure out what EU laws will apply to them, veteran human rights campaigner Bernadette McAliskey has said.Speaking at event in Dublin to mark the 50th anniversary of Northern Ireland’s civil rights movement, the former House of Commons MP said she was struggling to help “an absolute tsunami of vulnerable people” worried about Brexit through the community and migrant support group she runs in Co Tyrone.Dungannon, where her group, South Tyrone Empowerment Programme or STEP is based, has a large migrant population. Immigrants account for more than one in 10 of the town’s population.Ms McAliskey said UK immigration rules have already changed in preparation for the UK’s departure from the EU in March 2019 and that she was “caught up in the minutiae of fire-fighting” to help people deal with those changes. This, she said, was making it difficult for people to plan ahead.“I don’t have time to breathe right at the minute because of the panic, consternation, fear and real impact that crashing out of the EU – or even a negotiated exit – is going to bring, not simply to the new population, the immigrant population, but to people whose everyday life is simply thrown up in the air,” she said.“We are daily working with people who are trying to understand when European regulations and laws no longer work for people, and what will the legislation be to protect their everyday position.”Ms McAliskey said the current situation in Northern Ireland reminded her of the civil rights movement of the late 1960s and the 1970s, when activists tried to protect people’s civil rights in a rapidly changing society.“We ended up on a treadmill of reactive responses to the violation of rights and we couldn’t get our heads lifted to see what was happening in the bigger picture,” she said.The veteran activist spoke to The  on Saturday at a seminar entitled We Shall Overcome, marking 50 years of the civil rights movement. The event was organised by a group of trade unions including Siptu and Ictu at Liberty Hall in Dublin.A half-century ago, the Tyrone woman held a prominent role in the student-led civil rights association that catalogued discrimination against Catholics in housing and employment, and demanded equal voting for all in local government elections. She was later elected MP for Mid Ulster in 1969, at the age of just 21.Ms McAliskey said she believed few people understood what impact Brexit was already having.“I don’t think anybody who is not working at that coalface has the slightest idea of the chaos we are already in and how much worse it is going to be,” she said.She was not optimistic that the UK will depart the EU with a negotiated orce deal.“The rational, logical, sane answer is that there has to be some form of agreement – but this is the British government we are dealing with. This is the last delusion of a dead empire in the resurrection, so rationale and logic doesn’t really come into it,” she said.Michael Farrell, another veteran civil rights leader from the Northern Ireland movement of the late 1960s, told the Liberty Hall seminar that Brexit had polarised the North’s population and “threatens to remove or severely weaken mechanisms for protecting rights and equality”.“Sadly, those are the very mechanisms that can be used to protect or assert rights, like LGBTI rights, gender equality, women’s reproductive rights, workers’ rights, and the rights of migrants and asylum seekers,” said Mr Farrell, who with Ms McAliskey was involved in the People’s Democracy group.“It is around these rights that coalitions can be built across the traditional religious and political isions in Northern Ireland.”Mr Farrell said it was “vital” that the UK government stand by pledges given in December 2017 to avoid a hard border in Ireland and to protect the Belfast Agreement, so that there would be “no diminution of the protections of equality and human rights in Northern Ireland”.Without these protections, he warned, Northern Ireland could “slip back into ghettoisation and sectarianism or even some level of violence”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Francois MoriPool via REUTERSSome 70 world leaders gathered under rainy skies at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on Sunday for a solemn ceremony to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of first World War.US president Donald Trump, Russia president Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and dozens of monarchs, presidents and prime ministers from Europe, Africa, the Middle East and beyond joined French president Emmanuel Macron to mark the moment guns fell silent across Europe a century ago. The commemoration is the centrepiece of global tributes to honour the 10 million soldiers who were killed during the 1914-18 war and the moment the Armistice, signed in northeastern France, came into effect at 11am on November 11th, 1918. French President Emmanuel Macron warn about the fragility of peace and the dangers of nationalism: a theme that seemed directed, at least in part, at Mr Trump, who listened stony-faced. “The traces of this war never went away,” Mr Macron said.The lesson of the Great War can not be that of resentment between peoples, nor should the past be forgotten,” he said Mr Macron, sorrow etched on the faces of former French soldiers standing to attention around him during the ceremony. “It is our deeply rooted obligation to think of the future, and to consider what is essential.”As Mr Trump’s convoy was making its way up the Champs Elysees to the Arc de Triomphe, a bare-breasted protester from the Femen radical feminist group ran towards his motorcade, coming within a few metres, before being apprehended by police. Photographs of the incident appeared to show that she had the words “fake peacemaker” scrawled across her body. In a glass canopy at the foot of the triumphal arch, built by Emperor Napoleon in 1806, the leaders stood for the solemn ceremony.The last to arrive was Russia’s Putin, who shook hands with Mr Macron, Dr Merkel and then Mr Trump, briefly giving the US leader a thumbs up. Mr Macron stood to attention as a military band played the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, before walking through the rain to inspect troops. He then took his place under the Arc while cellist Yo-Yo Ma played a movement from a Bach symphony.In a rare public display of emotion by the leaders of two world powers, Mr Macron and Dr Merkel held hands on Saturday during a poignant ceremony in the Compiegne Forest, north of Paris, where French and German delegations signed the Armistice that ended the war.Testimonies written by soldiers on November 11th, 1918, as the ceasefire took hold, will be read at Sunday’s event by high school students in French, English and German.The conflict was one of the bloodiest in history, reshaping Europe’s politics and demographics. Peace, however, was short-lived and two decades later Nazi Germany invaded its neighbours.On Sunday afternoon, Dr Macron will host the inaugural Paris Peace Forum, which seeks to promote a multilateral approach to security and governance and ultimately avoid the errors that led to the outbreak of World War One.Dr Merkel said in a statement the forum showed that “today there is a will, and I say this on behalf of Germany with full conviction, to do everything to bring a more peaceful order to the world, even though we know we still have much work to do.”Mr Trump, who champions a nationalist ‘America first’ policy, will not attend the forum.The US leader has said he will also not hold a bilateral meeting with Putin in Paris. Trump and Putin are expected to have formal talks later this month when both attend a G-20 summit in Buenos Aires.Should the two leaders chat briefly during Sunday’s events, their body language will be closely scrutinised.Special Counsel Robert Mueller is probing alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election and any possible collusion with Trump’s campaign. –Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

November 11 is celebrated as a public holiday, liberation day, in Belgium. Regimental flags were dipped as the reveille was sounded under the Menin Gate. Earlier the bands had played Danny Boy, A Long Way To Tipperary, and World in Union, later a piper would sound a lament and a choir would sing Abide With Me as wreaths were laid. The Lord\u0027s Prayer was read in Dutch and English before the exhortation preceding the minutes silence was read. we will remember them, answered the massed ranks at the Menin Gate before falling into silence. All that could be heard was the singing of the birds and the rustling of the autumnal trees lining the town\u0027s old fortifications around the gate. The Last Post was sounded, Every day since 1927, except during the German occupation of the Second World War, volunteer Belgian firemen from the Last Post Association have played it under the gate at 8pm as a sign of their country’s gratitude for the British sacrifice.That sacrifice was immense with 300,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers killed over the four years of war, five major battles, including Passchendaele which cost half a million casualties for the gain of just a few miles. Ypres, which was of major strategic importance, was constantly shelled by the surrounding German troops and the city reduced to rubble. Only the damaged steeple of the Cloth Hall was to survive the war.Winston Churchill suggested leaving Ypres, known locally as Ieper, as a it was as a warning to future generations. Instead, the city, at one point the only major Belgian city not on German hands, painstakingly rebuilt brick by brick, as close to how it was before the war as possible with the work paid for by war reparations.Today in 2018, the desire to remember the men was palpable among the crowds of people of all ages surrounding the Gate, where earlier at 6am a lone piper had played “Battle’s O’er”.Many were remembering their family members who had fought in the Great War. Max Dutton, 26, is assistant historian at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which manages memorials including the Gate.  “I have the best job in the world,” Max, who is from Harrogate, said, “and I am honoured to do it.”His maternal great grandfather, Private William Alvin of the East York Regiment, served and survived on the Sommes and Ypres. “He was gassed,” said Max,who studied the war at Kings College London, “my granny always used to say he coughed all his life.”Scott Watson, 33, is a fireman with six years service in the Royal Navy under his belt. His great great grandfather was killed in 1915 in France. His great grandad served in the Desert Rats and his Dad was in the navy for 32 years. He was among the packed crowds by the gate with his partner Catherine Shea, 34 and daughter Grace, 13.Lest we forget: First World War centenary commemorations, in pictures“This means everything to me and to my family. We’ve had the conversation with Grace. It is our responsibility to make sure future generations remember them and Grace must make sure her children remember as well. We will never forget.”Others came because they too had experienced the terrors of war. Gareth Richards is a former warrant officer with the Royal Engineers, who served in Kosovo, Bosnia and Northern Ireland. He travelled to Ypres with 25 veterans of the regiment from Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Royal Engineers fought on the salient, digging under German positions and planting explosives.Gareth, who lives in Paisley, was here to pay tribute to his great grandfather, a private in the Welsh Fusiliers. Robert Evans was taken prisoner in the First Battle of Ypres in August 1914. He later served in the Home Guard in World War Two.Wearing his great grandfather’s medals from the Boer war and First World War alongside his own, Gareth said, “This is so important to mark history. There are going to be a lot of tears today.”The men marched out towards the front from Ypres, some along the route on which Reginald Blomfield’s triumphal arch has stood since 1927.  Siegfried Sassoon hated it and wrote of the “Dead who struggled in the slime Rise and deride this sepulchre of crime” in his poem On Passing The  New Menin Gate.After it was completed, it was realised there was not enough room on the memorial for all the names of the missing. A further 34, 984 names were added to a memorial at the nearby Tyne Cot military cemetery. Even now along the Western Front, about 40 missing soldiers are found every year.An HQ dugout near Ypres during the First World War, found in a scrapbook belonging to Captain Robert Harley Egerton BennettIn an echo of the journey, volunteers took part in the “poppy parade” on Sunday. A march down to the gate holding baskets of poppies. They were handed to members of the CWG commission who tossed them from the top of the gate so they floated down from the top of the arch, which contains two halls of memory. Each of the many, many poppies symbolised a live lost in the First World War. In a touching display of remembrance some firefighters in full dress uniform, and other onlookers, bended down to pick them up before gently stowing them away in pockets and wallets as souvenirs.The soldiers called Ypres “Wipers” and published a wartime newspaper called the Wipers Times. Other Dutch names were adapted for British tongues and would soon become legendary in the history of World Word One. Places such Ploegsteert, the scene of bitter fighting, were rechristened Plug Street.Once in the fields of Flanders, the soldiers faced the hellish conditions of trench warfare. It was in Ypres that poison gas was first used. The German use of chlorine  on April 22  1915 against British, Canadian and French soldiers marked the beginning of the Second Battle of Ypres. Mustard gas, which was also called Yperite from the town’s name, was used for the first time near the city in 1917.Jacques Ryckebosch grew up in Ypres and used to be the curator of Talbot House in nearby Poperinge, where soldiers would go for a cup of tea and to relax on relief from the front. He now gives tours of the battlefields and was involved in today’s moving ceremony.Jacques, who is married to a British woman, remembers taking Harry Patch, the last fighting Tommy and last surviving veteran of the First World War, to the place in Ypres where he was wounded by a shell that killed three of his comrades. Harry died in 2009, aged 111.“All of the memories of Harry and the other veterans who visited Ypres have come back,” Jacques said, “Harry and all of them are always with me, their voices in the back of my brain.”Jacques, whose Belgian grandfather was shot and gassed during the war and is married to a British woman, said, “There is such a strong bond between Belgium and Britain. When you come here to the Gate, the language here is English,. And no one who lives here has forgotten.”Benoit Mottrie,chariman of the Last Post Association and the grandson of its founder Aime Gruwez’ said, This is the busiest time I have ever witnessed. In the 1950s, 60s, 70s it was often just the two police stopping the traffic the buglers, and maybe a handful of people, sometimes no one when we played the Last Post.  I don\u0027t think we will ever be alone again.Poppies with messages are seen next to the Menin Gate Memorial in YpresPaul Burkitt, 66, from Stourbridge, travelled to Ypres with hius niece, Eleanor Foulkes, 28. Paul had three great uncles and only one returned from Europe. One was killed in France and the other on the first day of the battle of the Somme.Eleanor, an actor, grew up in Montreal, Canada. Ypres was one of the founding legends of ther Canadain military, who were fighting under their command for the first time.“The importance of remembering cannot be overstated, especially for my generation as the war gets further and further away and back into history,” she said.John MacCrae, the Lieutenant  Colonel of the Canadian Expeditionary Force was also from Montreal He wrote In Flanders Fields on May 3 1915, sitting on the back of a medical field ambulance near an advance dressing post at Essex Farm, North of Ypres. It was the day after he had presided over the funeral of his friend lieutenant Alexis Helmer, who was killed during the Second Battle of Ypres.The poem, published 100 years ago in 1918 after  Macrae’s death in France in January of the same year, reads. “If you break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders Fields”.Today in Ypres, at the culmination of four years of centenary memorials and as the Belgian and British anthems were played at the end of the hour long ceremony under the cold, overcast Flanders\u0027 sky , faith, and the flame of remembrance, burned as brightly as ever.  Britain\u0026#39s armed forces risk being paralysed by \u0026#39lawfare\u0026#39, warns Chief of Defence StaffBoy, 10, dies and eight-year-old girl seriously injured in incident at

Last week, the Supreme Court acquitted her, and she secretly left her prison, causing violent protests from Islamists, who said she should be hanged for blasphemy. The Foreign Office has said that she is still in the country, meaning her life is at tremendous risk.

Church bells across the UK remained restricted throughout the course of the war and only rang freely once Armistice was declared on November 11, 1918.  Experienced bell ringer Louise Booth shows the ropes to new recruit Leanne Masterdon, whose grandfather served in WW1At that moment, bells erupted spontaneously across the country, as an outpouring of relief that four years of war had come to an end.Battle\u0027s Over, a series of hundreds of local events to mark the centenary of the Armistice, will also take place on Sunday.Pipers will play, beacons will be lit and church bells will ring in all corners of the UK and around the world as communities pay tribute to the First World War fallen.Described as a nation\u0027s tribute, Battle\u0027s Over has been in the planning for four years and will see hundreds of locally-organised events mark the centenary.Director Danny Boyle is asking people to gather on beaches across the UK on November 11 and etch silhouettes in the sand remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict.Events will take place at low tide at a number of beaches, including Perranporth in Cornwall, Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, and St Ninian\u0027s beach in Shetland.The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has hosted a military parade in Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day.Around 80 world leaders were in attendance, including Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Angela Merkel, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Jean-Claude Juncker, for a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe.Trump and his wife Melania arrived in the French capital yesterday, and were greeted at the Elysee Palace in Paris by the French President and his wife Brigitte.The two leaders and their wives greet one another at the Elysee Palace on SaturdayMerkel will later give a speech at the Paris Peace Forum, which focuses on \u0027concrete initiatives to strengthen multilateral cooperation\u0027.Macron has spent the week visiting towns, cities and battlefield cites around northeast France to commemorate the anniversary.

It\u0027s been 100 years since my father served and 70 years since I served.But that doesn\u0027t mean we should stop remembering and thinking about the millions who sacrificed themselves fighting for us.It\u0027s essential that the younger generations are taught about the wars so it never happens again, and so they can remember their family members.I am honoured to be a part of the service today - it is always special when so many veterans are together in one place to remember our friends and family.Our correspondent James Crisp at the Menin Gate at Ypres, Belgium, captured the moment thousands of poppy petals were released as part of a poignant tribute at the site of one of the worst slaughters of the conflict.The President of Germany has made history today appearing at the Cenotaph.Following the Prince of Wales who laid a wreath on behalf of the Queen, Frank Walter-Steinmeier laid a wreath at the foot of the Cenotaph and stood with his head bowed.President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier lays a wreath during the remembrance service at the Cenotaph memorialHe is the first German dignitary invited to the Cenotaph and was watched by his wife Elke Budenbender who accompanied the Duchess of Sussex on the Foreign Office balcony.The Queen was accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge although the Duke of Edinburgh was absent having retired from official duties last year.The Duchess of Sussex watching the service at the Cenotaph from the balcony of the Foreign and Commonwealth OfficeJoe Shute, our correspondent at the Cenotaph, says: Having laid their wreaths the Royal Family has now departed and the march past the Cenotaph is about to commence.Among the charities involved in the march are the Children and Families of Far East Prisoners of War. Veterans attending the service of remembrance at the CenotaphPam Gillespie, of Harlow in Essex, is marching with her two daughters and nine-year-old grandson, Thomas, (among the youngest taking part) in memory of her father George Money, who was captured in Java in 1942 and spent three-and-a-half years as a prisoner of war, and her great uncle Thomas Smith, a Lance Corporal in the Lancashire Fusiliers who was killed at Gallipoli in April 1915.“He was 25 when he died,” she says. “I’ve got a photograph of him and looking at it you just think of the waste of life.  It must have been horrendous for him.

I think of those who gave their lives for this nation and served.”The service has begun at the Cenotaph with Elgar\u0027s Nimrod being played at the national memorial. The Prince of Wales is due to lead the nation\u0027s tributes to all those who have lost their lives in conflict on the centenary of the Armistice today.He will lay a wreath at the Cenotaph on behalf of his mother for the second year in a row while an equerry will lay a wreath on behalf of the Duke of Edinburgh.The Queen will watch the Whitehall service from the balcony of the nearby Foreign and Commonwealth Office.For the first time, a German leader will lay a wreath at the Cenotaph, with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier performing the duty on behalf of his nation in an historic act of reconciliation between the two countries.At 11, all the bells in Ypres rang out.

David Lidington, the minister for the Cabinet Office, is attending the ceremonies.  The oldest veteran taking part in today’s march past the Cenotaph is 103-year-old Ron Freer. The former Royal Artillery Sergeant spent four years in a Japanese prisoner of war camp during the Second World War and suffered such severe malnutrition he was left blinded for life.Born in Teignmouth, Devon, he was three-years-old when his father William was killed at the Somme on September 4, 1918 and travels out every year to the Dernancourt Communal Cemetery in France to lay a poppy wreath at his grave.Mr Freer, 103, is set to march at the Cenotaph in London this Remembrance SundayFreer’s son, David, who is pushing his father’s wheelchair in the march, said: “When we go over to his grave in France we always leave him for a few moments to reflect and the tears come into his eyes. It is very emotional.”Freer, who is marching with the charity Blind Veterans UK, described being the oldest veteran to attend as a “huge honour”.The Armistice on 11 November 1918 caused the number of Great War deaths to plummet considerably, but as Britain marks the Armistice centenary it\u0027s important to remember that casualties still continued after this date.American troops cheer after hearing the news that the Armistice had been signed, meanwhile hundreds of solider continued to die on that dayDid you know that 861 people are recorded as having died on Armistice Day itself? The youngest of these was Private William Leet of the Royal Air Force who died aged 17 and whose memorial can be found in Sidcup, Kent. The last soldier killed before the Armistice took effect was Henry Gunther, an American who died at 10:59am on 11 November 1918.Crowds have been gathering around Whitehall since daybreak with a long queue stretching around Victoria Embankment to attend the commemorative service at the Cenotaph.Sean Wareing of Preston is one of those to bag an early spot on Whitehall by the statue of Field Marshal Earl Haigh,  commander-in-chief of the British Armies in France during the First World War.Wareing\u0027s grandfather, Thomas, served with the Royal North Lancashire Regiment and was awarded the Military Medal for actions at Passchendaele, helping to arrest 18 Germans.

Shuttle buses will ferry them between the presidential palace and the Arc de Triomphe, except for Donald Trump who will be driven there in his limousine, “the Beast”, for security reasons.President Macron will make a speech, which his aides say will emphasise parallels between 1918 and 2018. The leaders,  including Mr Trump, Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin,  will then attend a luncheon at the Elysee Palace.German Chancellor Angela Merkel being greeted by French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron as she arrived at the Elysee Palace in Paris this morningIn the afternoon, many of them will attend an International Peace Forum, but Donald Trump, no fan of international organisations, will not attend.The meeting at the Musee d’Orsay art museum on the banks of the Seine is intended to stress multilateralism and the importance of international alliances in resolving conflicts. Instead, Mr Trump will visit an American military cemetery in Suresnes, in western Paris, and is to hold a press conference before flying home.However, rain is forecast, which may prompt the US president to cancel the cemetery visit. Yesterday he cancelled a visit to another American cemetery 50 miles from Paris because of the weather. About 10,000 soldiers and police will guard the ceremonies.Anti-Trump protesters are planning to demonstrate in the afternoon at Place de la République in central Paris, about three miles east of the Arc de Triomphe. Police will maintain tight security at the protest, which the authorities fear could be hijacked by violent groups.On a day that will see countless symbolic acts of public remembrance around the country, ‘Pages of the Sea’, a vast public art project curated by the Oscar-winning filmmaker Danny Boyle and commissioned by 14-18 Now, the UK art programme for the First World War centenary, sees 32 immense sand portraits depicting casualties from the conflict etched into the coastline of Britain and Ireland.Volunteers rake the sand as they draw depictions of those killed in WW1, part of Danny Boyle\u0026#39s Pages of The Sea celebrations, on Sunny Sands Beach in FolkestoneFrom St Ninian’s on Shetland to Porthcurno in Cornwall, the 30ft long images – each with a connection to the local area – are being drawn at low tide by teams of six to 10 artists delicately wielding garden rakes. Once completed around three hours later, crowds will have just moments to absorb the haunting faces of the fallen gazing back at them before they are reclaimed by the advancing tides.In Folkestone, Kent, where Boyle is in attendance to witness a larger, 60ft likeness of war poet Wilfred Owen carved into Sunny Sands, volunteers from the artistic collective Sand In Your Eye have been working under torchlight to lay out the portrait with LED markers. A small crowd of all ages has defied sea squalls and driving rain to witness the drawing, which is anticipated to be finished at 10.30am. At that point, they will be invited to create their own sand portraits using stencils. In advance of the tides turning, they will then have a fleeting moment to reflect on the Glorious Dead.Volunteers working on Pages of the Sea this morning Beaches are truly public spaces, where nobody rules other than the tide, Boyle said in advance of the day. They seem the perfect place to gather and say a final goodbye and thank you to those whose lives were taken or forever changed by the First World War.Please review our commenting policyArmistice Day: the final day of the First World War, as it happened on November 11, 1918Britain\u0026#39s armed forces risk being paralysed by \u0026#39lawfare\u0026#39, warns Chief of Defence StaffBoy, 10, dies and eight-year-old girl seriously injured in incident at house in Tayside\u0026#39Poppy parade\u0026#39 falls over Ypres as crowds mark 100 years since the end of the First World WarComment: The plight of Asia Bibi should have everyone in the West trembling Remembrance Day: Poppies, Armistice and why the act of remembrance matters11 of the 11th: the First World War soldiers who lost their lives on Armistice DayThe toll of war: record numbers of bell ringers recruited for Armistice celebrationDonald Trump attacked for skipping Armistice commemoration \u0026#39because it was raining\u0026#39David Miliband \u0026#39poised to return to UK\u0026#39 as rumours of new Blairite party mountBritain\u0026#39s most senior Catholic faces questions over church\u0026#39s handling of child sex abuse claimsSuzy Lamplugh murder suspect complains of character \u0026#39assassination\u0026#39Comment: Though the way we remember World War One constantly changes, we mourn all the sameAsia Bibi \u0026#39not offered UK asylum amid concerns of unrest and attacks\u0026#39What Spice Girls fans with \u0026#39VIP tickets\u0026#39 get for £100 extra: A tote bag, a badge, a poster and some postcards  Strictly Come Dancing 2018, week 8 live: Danny John-Jules in dance-off danger after shaky samba and bullying allegationsRevealed: the obscure country bolthole where Lloyd George plotted the end of WW1Edward Lear\u0026#39s male characters were impotent as he was abused aged 10 by his older brother, researcher claimsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/09/TELEMMGLPICT000177541502_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqiUuvBizZT2q34Osm0tNw3X0aGPApSYsoTfgejYXeyQ.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"remembrance day poppies armistice act remembrance matters","story":"Poppy wreaths are piled on a work bench at The Poppy Factory in Richmond, west London on October 11, 2018Today marks 100 years since the end of the First World War, with the nation coming together in silence at 11am to remember the men and women who gave their life for their country.Tributes in the shape of films, poetry and exhibitions taking place over the course of year as events arts have kept the centenary in our minds, however it will come to the fore  today, on November 11.Every year in November, the nation marks the wars that have scarred our past and the bravery of the men and women who fought them.

evaluate the impact of reducing the number of free-to-use ATMs on vulnerable consumersAn inquiry into consumers\u0027 access to financial services has been launched by MPs amid concerns some vulnerable customers are finding it increasingly difficult.The Treasury Committee will scrutinise whether certain groups of people are excluded from obtaining a basic level of service from providers.It will also examine whether vulnerable consumers pay more for financial services products.\u0027Almost everything has changed in banking since the financial crisis\u0027Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Committee, said: “Vulnerability, as defined by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), is where someone who, due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to detriment, particularly when a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care.“With customers expected to take more responsibility for their financial planning and resilience, bank branches closing and the number of free-to-use ATMs falling, it\u0027s becoming increasingly difficult for vulnerable customers to access certain financial services.“The committee will examine the practicality of the FCA\u0027s definition, the effectiveness of attempts by financial services providers to prevent increased financial exclusion and whether a premium is placed on products such as travel insurance for vulnerable consumers.“As part of this inquiry, we\u0027ll be holding sessions outside of Parliament to hear from vulnerable consumers who have interacted with financial services providers.”Bank branch closures reach ‘alarming’ rate of 60 per month Bank pairs bank branches with customer service. It worksEx-Barclays boss Antony Jenkins says bank branches will be blitzedQuestions the committee will consider include how financial services firms define vulnerability.It will look at the training in place at financial services firms in relation to vulnerable consumers and consider the merits of having a “duty of care” for financial services providers and examine whether this would increase protection for vulnerable customers.The committee will also examine which customers are most disadvantaged when bank branches close and consider whether there is evidence to suggest that bank branch closure leads to increased financial exclusion.It will also evaluate the impact of reducing the number of free-to-use ATMs on vulnerable consumers.Other aspects of financial services the inquiry will look at include how firms ensure their information is accessible to people with low literacy levels the use of the Post Office\u0027s services in areas where bank branches have closed the systems in place for power of attorney at financial services providers, and whether certain barriers which lead to people not having a bank account.The inquiry will also examine whether vulnerable consumers pay prohibitively more for certain financial services products, including travel and home insurance.The committee also wants to know how technological innovation could help those who cannot easily access physical financial services branches.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said.

So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

In the first half of 2018, 2,692 shops closed, while 1,569 opened – leading to a net loss of 1,123. The closures were mainly seen in the areas most affected by online shopping, such as fashion and electricals, while a shift to “in-home leisure” saw pubs taking a hit and 340 stores in the restaurant, catering and entertainment sector disappearing. Why the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenPhilip Hammond to announce £1.5bn plan to support high streetDebenhams to close 50 stores putting 4,000 jobs at riskAsos sales soar as online retailer leaves high street rivals behindSome of the UK’s biggest retail brands have been rocked by financial difficulties this year, with many forced to close branches. House of Fraser\u0026nbsprecently\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) aimed at cutting costs failed to impress creditors. The chain was subsequently bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, but he has been unable to save all stores. Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The European Commission – the heart of the Brussels empire, the “EUSSR”, – was always going to project a weak economic future for the UK post-Brexit, wasn’t it?A\u0026nbspgroup led by the malevolent Jean-Claude Juncker was\u0026nbspalways going to show the remaining 27 nations of the EU prospering while Britain, out of the club, stumbles helplessly.Such is the conspiratorial temper of our times that such reactions to the latest forecasts from the commission, showing precisely that, are sadly inevitable.UK set for weakest growth in Europe, European Commission warnsBut it’s still a silly conspiracy. For the commission’s forecasts for the UK are not, in fact, wildly different from those of others.The commission sees UK growth in 2019 of a paltry 1.2 per cent. The most recent average forecast from a range of UK forecasters – UK banks and economic consultancies – is growth of 1.4 per cent.That would leave us with faster projected growth than Italy – but still below every other EU economy.It’s true that the Office for Budget Responsibility in last week’s Budget projected growth of 1.6 per cent next year. But this was mainly due to the boost to demand from the chancellor’s extra spending on the health services and his income tax cuts. The OBR expects growth to fall back in 2020 to 1.4 per cent.The idea that the commission has produced some ridiculously pessimistic outlier forecasts for the UK doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.The commission thinks growth in the eurozone and the EU will slow down too in 2019, but not to the extent that it will in the UK.There’s another vital piece of context. The commission’s forecasts – like those of the OBR – are based on the presumption of a smooth Brexit next year, where we secure a withdrawal agreement and remain in the single market and customs union until the end of 2020.The weakness in almost all forecasts essentially reflects assumptions that the UK economy is slowing due to weakening household demand, feeble business investment and lacklustre exports.That may, or may not, be borne out.But in a sense it’s a red herring when thinking about the economics of Brexit.The really important forecasts to bear in mind are those of a severe economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit and long-term damage to our potential growth rate as a result of a Brexit in which we leave the single market and customs union.On this credible economists and forecasters are united.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Shoppers are increasingly staying home and ordering online“Help,” cried the retail industry.No wonder. Ten years ago this month Woolworths went pop. Dark clouds seem to have been bubbling and spitting over the high street ever since. That was underlined by a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the professional services firm, showing that a net 1,123 stores vanished from Britain’s top 500 high streets in the first six months of this year.\u0026nbspThe numbers probably won’t surprise anyone given the high-pocalypse we’ve witnessed among some of retail’s biggest names this year, including the likes of Toys ‘R’Us, Maplin, Poundworld and House of Fraser.\u0026nbspBritish high street is losing 14 shops a day, new research showsTowns with ‘unhealthy’ high streets have lower life expectancyWhy the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenHowever, closures have actually been outstripping new openings since 2010, and the gap is widening.Of course, the British Retail Consortium steamed in with a call for the government to take urgent action on business rates, beyond the tinkering contained in the chancellor’s recent budget.\u0026nbspThe levy is linked to property values and so hits bricks and mortar operators a lot harder than online outfits, which run their operations from out of town in places where you can buy land for a handful of coppers and a Mars bar.\u0026nbspIt has become the industry’s bête noire, and the trade body wouldn’t be doing its job if it didn’t make a fuss about it. But even if you completely eliminated it, the trend would likely continue, albeit perhaps at a slower rate.Britain\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspembraced internet shopping like almost no other nation, and that isn’t changing.\u0026nbspIt’s so much more convenient to have the retailer come to you\u0026nbspwhen the alternative is\u0026nbspslogging around the high street trailing children who’d rather be somewhere else and hoping you get finished\u0026nbspbefore the traffic wardens notice\u0026nbspyour car is illegally parked. Doubly so\u0026nbspif\u0026nbspyou’re time poor. Most Britons are. We\u0026nbspwork some of the longest hours in Europe.\u0026nbspPwC’s head of retail, Lisa Hooker, pointed out to me that 20 per cent of non food items are now bought online. The number is set to increase to 30 per cent by 2021. That says it all.So does this mean the high street is in terminal decline? Are the debates over its future worthless?\u0026nbspNot necessarily. Hooker made note of the fact that all the reliable surveys show that there is still a demand for bricks and mortar shops.\u0026nbspConsumers\u0026nbspjust use them less than they used to, and they want them to operate differently, alongside and as a complement\u0026nbspto their online excursions.\u0026nbspThat means the future will have to be made up of smaller premises that operate as mini showrooms, alongside “experience”\u0026nbspretailers such as vape shops and ice cream parlours, which have been doing well. As have\u0026nbsp(hooray!) book and record shops, which have been\u0026nbspmaking a come back.Encouraging short term “pop up”\u0026nbspstores to open temporarily\u0026nbspalongside them them could help\u0026nbspdraw people in.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The truth is that ministers have dithered and delayed for far too long. We now need urgent action.”Nuclear waste could be buried underneath national parks, say MPsSue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary of Prospect union, called the decision “devastating”.“Government has ultimate responsibility for ensuring a secure and stable supply of energy throughout the UK,” she said.“The truth is that ministers have dithered and delayed for far too long. We now need urgent action.“Our analysis shows that if the Government were to take a 50 per cent\u0026nbspstake then there would be a net benefit to the public purse, so there really is no excuse not to.”Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said Labour supports Moorside as they see nuclear as a key part of the UK’s energy mix, but said the government should have stepped in to support it.A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said Toshiba’s withdrawal was “entirely a commercial decision”.“Nuclear has an important role to play as part of the UK’s erse energy mix as we transition to a low-carbon economy, but in each case projects must provide value for money for consumers and taxpayers,” they said.“This government remains committed to new nuclear through the Industrial Strategy Nuclear Sector Deal as well as consenting the first new nuclear power station in a generation at\u0026nbspHinkley Point C.”Critics of nuclear power said the government should see the new circumstances\u0026nbspas an opportunity to move away from nuclear to cheaper technologies such as wind and solar power.“Shifting away from expensive, complicated technology towards cheaper and easier-to-build renewables gives the UK the opportunity to build an electricity system that will keep bills for homes and businesses down for years to come,” said Dr Jonathan Marshall, head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.“Cancelling Moorside does leave a gap in the UK’s decarbonisation plans, but one that is more likely to be filled with the technologies of the future rather than the past.”Additional reporting by PA.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In the first half of 2018, 2,692 shops closed, while 1,569 opened – leading to a net loss of 1,123. The closures were mainly seen in the areas most affected by online shopping, such as fashion and electricals, while a shift to “in-home leisure” saw pubs taking a hit and 340 stores in the restaurant, catering and entertainment sector disappearing. Why the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenPhilip Hammond to announce £1.5bn plan to support high streetDebenhams to close 50 stores putting 4,000 jobs at riskAsos sales soar as online retailer leaves high street rivals behindSome of the UK’s biggest retail brands have been rocked by financial difficulties this year, with many forced to close branches. House of Fraser\u0026nbsprecently\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) aimed at cutting costs failed to impress creditors. The chain was subsequently bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, but he has been unable to save all stores. Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling dropped more than 0.3 per cent against the greenback to $1.3021, and fell 0.21 per cent against the euro to €1.1471. Analysts put the dip partly down to the US federal reserve’s indication that it will hike rates in December, which strengthened the dollar.

While growth for the third quarter on the whole was lifted by 0.6 per cent - the fastest rate since 2016 - economists said this was likely to be a one-off. With “persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters”, according to Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce. Meanwhile, Schroders senior European economist Azad Zangana said the economy is not forecast to pick up in the near term. “We expect UK fourth quarter growth to be very weak as Brexit paralysis truly takes hold,” he said. “Assuming the government can successfully negotiate the withdrawal agreement with Brussels and ratify it in Parliament, then we could see a rebound in growth early next year. “However, a failure to complete a deal which would mean a no-deal or cliff-edge Brexit, is likely to cause a further slowdown in activity, which could be enough to tip the UK into recession.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the real aim was to display a vision of the future – a mighty port city and commercial centre for the region which would put Dubai and Bahrain in the shade.Not everything went according to plan. While the delegates were being shown around the site of this projected\u0026nbspmega city, gunmen on motorcycles shot dead three workers and injured five others constructing homes in the suburbs for future residents. It was the fourth fatal shooting in the area in recent months\u0026nbspmore than three dozen builders had died in a series of attacks, with the Baloch Liberation Front, a group seeking an independent Balochistan,\u0026nbspbeing\u0026nbspheld responsible.The development of Gwadar is a matter of vital importance for a Pakistani government trying to rescue an economy which is\u0026nbspin dire straits. It has\u0026nbsprepeatedly claimed that violence in the area has been brought under control. On a trip to the town two weeks ago, however, my colleagues and I were only allowed to move around under army escort.Huge protests in Pakistan after Christian woman on death row releasedBut separatist strife is not the only issue with\u0026nbspGwadar. The port\u0026nbspis a prominent part of the $60bn\u0026nbsp(£46bn) China-Pakistan Economic Corridor\u0026nbsp(CPRC), which in turn is part of Beijing’s global Belt and Road Initiative,\u0026nbspa massive and\u0026nbspcontroversial mission which has become a huge geopolitical talking point.To the Chinese government and its supporters, the Belt and Road\u0026nbspproject – set to be established in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe,\u0026nbspwith offshoots in Latin America –\u0026nbspis a purely strategic infrastructure programme which will spread trade and the benefit it brings across many lands.To its\u0026nbspgrowing number of detractors, the real aim is to spread Chinese\u0026nbsphegemony using commerce in tandem with the naval bases\u0026nbsp– the\u0026nbsp“String of Pearls”\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspBeijing is building on the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The covert motive, it is claimed, is to spread “debt-trap diplomacy”\u0026nbspby providing finance and then extracting advantage when debtor countries have difficulties paying back. The most notorious example of this so far is Sri Lanka ceding a port, Hambantota, in return for the waiver of $1bn on loans.This is a good time to ask the Saudis for favours, they wouldn’t want to turn anyone away with the bad publicity they are gettingChina is Islamabad’s long-term, staunch backer and is\u0026nbspincreasingly important – especially as a previous ally, the US, is now courting India, the country with which Pakistan has been locked in rivalry since both states became free from British colonial rule more than seven\u0026nbspdecades ago.There is also the crucial economic factor:\u0026nbspPakistan is greatly in need of money from its friends. Two weeks ago, the country’s new prime minister, Imran Khan told The Independent\u0026nbspin an interview about the stark reality of the financial situation. While many international political and business leaders had pulled out of an economic forum in Riyadh following the murder of\u0026nbspjournalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, he had to go because, he admitted,\u0026nbsp“We are desperate for money ... The reason I have to take this opportunity is because we are a country of 210 million people and we have the worst debt crisis in our history.” Without funding from abroad, he pointed out, “we actually won’t have in another three months enough foreign exchange to service our debts or pay for our imports.”Imran Khan (second right)\u0026nbspattends\u0026nbspthe opening ceremony of the Future Investment Initiative\u0026nbspin Riyadh last month (AFPGetty)Khan wanted to attract investors at the forum to Pakistan. But the main aim was to secure Saudi largesse. Failure to get funds from the kingdom as well as from China would mean turning to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Pakistan’s 13th bailout – accompanied by\u0026nbspinevitably\u0026nbspharsh strictures on public spending, with the population already suffering from an austerity package.Khan secured a very welcome $6bn\u0026nbspfrom the Saudis after meeting the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the man who has been accused of being complicit in Jamal Khashoggi’s death (though he denies any knowledge). “It sounds callous, I know,”\u0026nbspsaid a senior official in Islamabad, “but this is a good time to ask the Saudis for favours, they wouldn’t want to turn anyone away with all the bad publicity they are getting.”As well as the loan pledge, Pakistan got an agreement for Saudi Arabia to invest in a new oil refinery in Gwadar. A Saudi delegation visited the port and, according to petroleum minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan,\u0026nbsp“showed an interest to immediately invest in the refinery”. The agreement will be signed by the kingdom’s oil giant Aramco and the Pakistan State Oil company, but, he said, “we sat down and held discussions and it was principally decided by both sides that it will be a government to government agreement.”Gwadar can become a strategic port on the edge of the Indian Ocean (Amanda Coakley)This week Khan was on a trip to China during which he sought further funds to add to the $6bn Beijing has loaned Pakistan since last year to prop up its foreign exchange reserves. There were recriminations after Pakistan’s national television channel used a caption saying “begging” instead of “Beijing”. It was due to an unfortunate typographical error, the broadcaster said in its apology.Beijing is expected to acquiesce, but it has also repeated its call on Islamabad to carry out the type of structural reforms the IMF\u0026nbsphad also demanded in response to Pakistan’s latest appeal for help.There has also been annoyance in Beijing at criticism of the Belt and Road\u0026nbspfrom Pakistani officials, including Khan himself when he was in opposition, as well as two officials in his government. Abdul Razzak Dawood, an adviser to the prime minister on commerce, had held that some of the deals made were unfair to Pakistani companies. The railways minister, Sheikh Rashid, has wanted to cut the size of the Karachi-Peshawar rail line, saving $2bn from the $8bn budget.There are also claims, in Pakistan and abroad, that the Belt and Road\u0026nbspis one of the main contributors to Pakistan’s economic problems. Beijing has insisted that Pakistan buy Chinese equipment for projects, which has denuded foreign exchange reserves. Beijing has then extended loans to cover the purchases, which, in turn, has sent debt soaring further.AFPGetty)The IMF has insisted that any loan it gives to Pakistan is not used to pay off the China debt. The organisation’s managing director, Christine Lagarde,\u0026nbsphas stressed\u0026nbspthat there must be “absolute transparency” over this. The US, too, has demanded similar stipulations. Washington has long been hostile towards the Chinese project, charging that Beijing is using it to hold nations in thrall.Relations between the US and Islamabad are at a particularly low ebb\u0026nbspat present, in any case. Successive American presidents have threatened to cut aid to the Pakistani military unless action was taken against the Taliban and other violent Islamist groups which\u0026nbspthe west (and the Afghan government) claim are fed and watered in Pakistan and sent to carry out murderous attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan has always denied the allegation.Donald Trump’s first tweet this year said that the US “has foolishly given Pakistan more than $33bn\u0026nbspin aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies \u0026amp deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools”.

This is especially of concern as China is a major importer of Iranian oil, and has\u0026nbspbegun to invest heavily in Iran –picking up contracts being left behind by western companies pulling out after the reimposition\u0026nbspof sanctions by the Trump administration.Iran has experienced a number of terrorist attacks claimed by Isis which Tehran has blamed, without offering evidence, on Saudi Arabia. The scope for sectarian trouble\u0026nbspspreading to Balochistan was illustrated last month when 14 Iranian border guards were abducted by an extremist Sunni group Jaish al-Adli. Pakistani security forces say they have failed to find the kidnapped men, leading to warnings of action being taken by the Iranians.The Pakistani government has stressed that the Saudi money did not come with political strings attached and, in his interview\u0026nbspbefore he went to Riyadh, Imran Khan spoke of his regret at Mr Trump tearing up the nuclear deal with Iran and pursuing punitive measures against the country.Gwadar is a prominent part of a $60bn\u0026nbspinfrastructure project between China and Pakistan (Amanda Coakley)The prime minister said that Pakistan\u0026nbspwould like to be an intermediary between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Yet the Saudi-led Sunni block were unhappy when the Pakistani parliament, under the previous government, refused to take part in the current war in Yemen. Islamabad was privately warned that it would have to choose sides sooner rather than later. There have long been reports that Saudi Arabia has “bought” a nuclear bomb from Pakistan to act as a counter against a “Shia bomb” produced by Iran – and the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, set up by Riyadh and led by a Pakistani commander, General Raheel Sharif,\u0026nbspprimarily exists to counter Shia forces.According to Theodore Karasik, at Gulf State Analytics, a Washington consultancy firm, “Saudi moves and investments in Pakistan are a set and established policy that seeks to better integrate Islamabad into Riyadh’s camp.”Robert Emerson, a British security consultant, says:\u0026nbsp“China have invested heavily in Pakistan, but it is also engaging in a substantial way commercially with Iran. It is understandable that they do not want to see a Saudi presence imported into Gwadar, just over a 100km\u0026nbspfrom the Iranian border.“But China also now has problems with Belt and Road. There has been consistent opposition from the US, Japan, India and others and now we see some of those countries which were going to take part in it are having second thoughts.”China urged to close mass detention camps for Uighur MuslimsPakistan to plant 10 billion trees to combat decades of deforestationPakistan invites Saudi Arabia to join China’s Belt and Road corridorA number of states, including Malaysia, Nepal and Myanmar have pulled out of Chinese-financed programmes. Recent elections in the Males saw the defeat of the Beijing-backed President Abdulla Yameen under whose rule the nation has accrued $1.3bn debt to China, more than a quarter of its GDP. The opposition – whose candidate, Mohamed Solih, won at the polls\u0026nbsp– had warned of being sucked into a “serious debt trap”.In Colombia there has been widespread local opposition for eight years to the building of the $4bn Ituango dam, part funded by the Chinese, in an area with propensity for landslides. This year 26,000 people had to be evacuated after heavy rainfall led to a landslide environmentalists have been warning about.Saudi moves and investments in Pakistan are a set and established policy that seeks to better integrate Islamabad into Riyadh’s campIt has now been almost a decade since China overtook the US as Africa’s biggest trading partner. Nine countries have signed Belt and Road\u0026nbspagreements with Beijing and 20 others are engaged in talks to do so. The Chinese government pledged $60bn in preferential loans and investments at an economic forum for Africa three years ago.African countries, so far, have been readily receptive to the Chinese loans which have been pouring in. But concerns have been raised too,\u0026nbspwith the Centre for Global Development finding, for instance, that Djibouti, where the Chinese now have a military base, has seen its foreign debt swell from 50 per cent to 85 per cent of GDP with the largest amount by far owed to China. The Chinese company CMPort, the same one which built Hambantota in Sri Lanka, now under Chinese control, is building a port in the country at Doraleh.China also has aspirations for Europe to be the final destination for the land route of the Belt and Road, with the aim that every day trains from Chinese trading cities would arrive at distribution points in Duisburg, Madrid and London.But six months ago 27 out of 28 European Union ambassadors in Beijing\u0026nbspsigned off a report saying the project “runs counter to the European Union’s agenda for liberalising trade and pushes the balance of power in favour of subsidised Chinese companies”.In September, Brussels launched its response to the Belt and Road: the building of infrastructure across Europe and Asia with Federica Mogherini, the head of European Union foreign policy, describing it as the “European way” of connecting the two continents.But the European Union may not remain unified in its approach. The Hungarian ambassador did not sign the report in Beijing and now Britain appears to be keen for China deals. In December last year Philip Hammond, on a visit to Beijing, said, “I was privileged earlier this year to represent the UK\u0026nbspat the first Belt and Road forum and one of the things we will discuss is the opportunity for closer collaboration in delivering the ambitions of the Belt and Road programme.”Like Imran Khan’s Pakistan, Theresa May’s post-Brexit Britain cannot ignore Beijing at a time of economic hardship, however the true cost of this Chinese connection will\u0026nbspunfold in the future.belt and roadShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He spent his youth surfing on the margins of society, before floundering\u0026nbspon\u0026nbspthe seas\u0026nbspof a troubled marriage. Since then, he has taken up the only\u0026nbspsensible function now left open to him – to offer opinions on everything under the sun. By Andy MartinClick to followThe IndependentThe prince’s purpose flows from his inability to quite fit into time and spaceIt wasn’t quite a\u0026nbsproyal wave. More like a royal glance. To be honest,\u0026nbspI might have waved, or possibly saluted, or at least stood to attention. Not long ago, the Queen drove right past me in her Regal Roller on Lisson Grove. Lots of police outriders and suchlike. A chauffeur of course. But I saw her and she saw me. Then she took a right on Rossmore Road and she was gone. But she had bestowed upon me the royal gaze for a fleeting instant. So I know she’s real and, more importantly, so am I. There was a mutual confirmation of existence. Which was strangely reassuring.But where does Prince Charles fit into this great unreality show? The answer is that he doesn’t. Not really. He is, and always will be, the odd man out. And that may well be his saving grace. It is a little-known fact that the young Prince of Wales was once a surfer and a windsurfer.\u0026nbspA fugitive from landlocked society. But even right out on the margins he was always marginal. More of a wannabe.He definitely got wet a few times\u0026nbspand was to be seen, all too briefly, walking on water.\u0026nbspI know that for a while, back in the late 1970s, he was even president or patron of the British Surfing Association and held a reception for the British surfing team before they left to compete in South Africa. He made some remark about a lot of the surfers having abundant moustaches and were they for the purpose of keeping you warm in the water? Not exactly Oscar Wilde, but good try, your royal highness.We know that the heir apparent was no fan of the cold showers at Gordonstoun. Maybe he even started surfing in Scotland. But\u0026nbspit was at Cambridge that he attained the zenith of his theatrical career with brief appearances on stage as an eccentric prince of some kind. He was either in a dustbin or was wearing dustman’s kit. He always said his inspiration was the Goons (Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, and Harry Secombe), and knew “The Ying Tong\u0026nbspSong” off by heart, but even the most benevolent reviewers of the period would have to conclude that he was a Goon manqué.It was while at university that the idea got about that he had several butlers constantly in attendance, one for the royal toothbrush, another for buttoning the royal waistcoat and what not. This still seems\u0026nbspunlikely, given the limited accommodation, even at Trinity College. I saw him wandering the streets with his security guy way back when. No sign of Jeeves plural then anyhow. The flunkeys story probably got mythified out of all proportion. Clearly he has them. Actual stats hard or futile to ascertain.1948 Charles is born.

Kim Jong-un takes over in North Korea2012 Evidence for the Higgs\u0026nbspboson is discovered2017 Inauguration of Donald Trump2018 The prince’s 70th birthdayMaybe he should have become a serious historian. He would almost have fitted in amid the aggressively non-conformist refuseniks of the Senior Common Room. But didn’t he get a lower second? I guess that ruled him out. Shame really.He had his military period, like his old dad, but he never really took to life on the ocean wave, any more than to surfing. His career as Top Gun ended when he crashed a plane and had to be grounded for his own safety. But he still looked good in a uniform. So he thought he’d give marriage a shot. It was always going to be on the agenda at some stage. Future king has to think of passing on the baton at some point, always assuming someone has passed the baton on to him of course.Diana: she looked the perfect fairytale bride. A match made for global television. The prince and the princess. Sometimes one regrets that life does not resemble a fairytale in almost any particular. Unless, that is, the phrase “living happily ever after” can be taken to include mutual indifference, rancour, animosity, affairs galore, escapades of all sorts, falsehoods and confessions. James Dean argued that it was necessary to live fast, die young and be a good-looking corpse. It’s more glamorous, more Hollywood. So it could be that Charles missed his shot there too.Perhaps he was just not that cut out for marriage after all. Not everyone is. Perhaps no one. Why should he be more than another? He had a go at lover. Tried his hand at the difficult genre of the erotic utterance. Maybe he should have revised his Liaisons dangereuses beforehand.Having spent a certain amount of time floundering in his sea of troubles, far from the shores of public affection, Charles paddled back in with a degree of enlightenment and therefore took up the only sensible function now left open to him, a job with no known required qualifications, that of philosopher royal. His task was to offer opinions on everything under the sun.He succeeded in demolishing – theoretically – most modern architecture, anything after about 1900, but especially tall buildings, of which there are quite a few these days. He had a good point of course. He often does. Glass carbuncles were never going to be that popular.In the letters that have come to be known as the “black spider memos” he offered his advice to any number of ministers about matters ranging from homeopathy to foreign affairs. Which, technically, he is entitled to do. The sad thing is that, so far as can be determined, no one took any notice of him. Or perhaps did the exact opposite.Inspired by his old mentor, Laurence van der Post, he became a farmer-ecologist-conservationist. To be honest,\u0026nbsp his produce in Waitrose\u0026nbspis very\u0026nbspgood. The organic pears taste\u0026nbsplike pears of yore. Crunchy yet juicy. The “Duchy” business model is probably about as relevant as Disneyland to the state of agriculture as a whole, because the finances are all out of whack. After all, to some extent we\u0027re\u0026nbsppaying for the pears twice (and they weren’t cheap anyway)\u0026nbspbecause we are\u0026nbspsupporting the royal family through\u0026nbsptaxes. In that sense, Prince Charles has given the idea of living off the land a whole new meaning.Created with Sketch.Royal wedding ceremonies: through the years in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Royal Wedding - Harry and Meghan, 2018Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex emerge from the West Door of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle after their wedding ceremony240 Royal Wedding - Edward and Alexandra, 1863Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward  VII), and his bride, Princess Alexandra of Denmark, after their wedding340 Royal Wedding - Princess Patricia and Commander Alexander Ramsay, 1919Princess Patricia of Connaught, driving from Westminster Abbey, with her husband Commander Alexander Ramsay, after their wedding ceremony440 Royal Wedding - Elizabeth and Albert,1923Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later to be Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother) and Prince Albert, Duke of York (later to be King George VI) on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after their wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey540 Royal Wedding - Prince Henry and Lady Alice, 1935The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester on their wedding day.

Which would depend on the next generation moving out of the way. It’s not a good position to be in. It makes you think too much of those Snoopy cartoons where he is being a vulture in a tree, poised to swoop. It works in the cartoon though.Even if Charles is hemmed in by senior members of his family on one side and the upcoming juniors threatening to overtake him, I still have doubts as to whether Charles is that impatient to be king. Charles, as a historian, has read his Walter Bagehot, the great theorist of the British constitution (which does not in fact exist).Judi Dench, Tim Minchin, Harriet Walter, David Tennant and Paapa Essiedu\u0026nbspas part of a special production of Shakespeare Live! from the RSC in\u0026nbsp2016 (Getty)He knows that the role of the monarch is to be the “decorative” or “dignified” part of the constitution. I still can’t see that happening. According to Bagehot, the monarch enjoys three rights, “the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.” Charles will still stick his oar in, in other words, but the reality is that he will be more constrained as king than as prince. The Prince of Wales – and there is no shortage of precedent here – can get away with just about anything and he’s still prince. The prince is virtually obliged to misbehave. The king, on the other hand, is required to be kingly. He doesn’t get to write so many letters, erotic or otherwise. He would effectively have even less power than he has now.Is Charles up to the job? The job-that-is-not-a-job. Charles wants to be king but knows that he never quite can be, even if he is. What\u0026nbsphas proved to be endearing about Charles and strikes a universal note is that he is still looking for the thing he is really good at. He has had a go at just about everything and has succeeded brilliantly in the realm of failure. The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described a man as being someone who is not what he is and is what he is not. I’m still not sure what that means exactly but Prince Charles seems to exemplify this uncertain and paradoxical status to a high degree.\u0026nbspPrince Charles feels \u0027regret\u0027 at being \u0027deceived\u0027 by paedophile bishopBahraini royal sued for £35m in UK over deal to meet Bollywood starsJapan’s Princess Ayako gives up royal title as she marries ‘commoner’ He once – briefly – had a go at Hamlet, on stage, with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He\u0026nbsputtered probably the single most famous line in all tragedy:\u0026nbsp“To be or not to be, that is the question” – putting a crazy over-emphasis on the final word. And Charles himself is more of a question than an answer, an enigma inside an anomaly. King of infinite space or quintessence of dust?He is not too sure. Who are you?” a child once asked him. “I wish I knew,” he replies, in a Jonathan Dimbleby documentary.\u0026nbspA prince with a touch of imposter syndrome. He is, after all, only the “apparent” heir and fears that the real one may yet pop up and take his place. Charles makes me think of someone who is always a bit betwixt and between, a round peg in a square hole, neither one thing nor another, but still, all the same, continuing to give of his best and give it a decent shot anyway. He is, you have to say, a trier.The black spider letters were once memorably described as being “as controversial as back copies of the Beano” (credit to Stephen Glover in the Mail). I have to admit, though, to a sneaking affection for the Beano. And, similarly, for those great old double-breasted suits of his, and his archaic way of speaking, all of that, in a spirit of nostalgia. Which suggests why he was never really going to make it as a surfer – he prefers to swim against the prevailing current.The first Charles took that too far and ended up with his head on the block, but if you had to pinpoint a king who looks like some kind of plausible precursor, it would have to be King Canute, sticking his throne down in the sand and trying to hold back the tide.\u0026nbspWe know that he has passed on his board to Prince Harry, who once went surfing in Cornwall. Maybe he will take over as president of the British Surfing Association.Terry Eagleton once said of the Prince of Wales that “he wants the kind of change radical enough to do away with polluters and modernist architects, but not radical enough to do away with himself”. But what he wants or doesn’t want is not really the point. If modern capitalism is all about “creative destruction”, then the feudal principle (and primogeniture) he embodies stands as a kind of counterweight or counterpoint to transience, a symbol of persistence or resistance (even if manifestly unfair and absurd). In the age of information and Donald Trump, he looks like someone who wouldn’t be well-equipped to tweet in the middle of the night. On the other hand, he could probably speak up for Gaia and communing with trees in a way that the average world leader might well shy away from.The prince’s purpose flows from his inability to quite fit into time and space.\u0026nbspWhether willingly or not, he has become the representative of all those (which is everyone, at one time or another) who feel rejected or excluded or left out in the cold or just waiting for a door to open that remains stubbornly closed. His charitable endeavours, on behalf of refugees and other fugitives from fate, reflect this role. Prince he may be, but he is already king of an immense and populous realm, the great and lonely kingdom of outsiders.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It\u0027s very much a continuation of the styling OnePlus used on the OnePlus 6 earlier in the year. That was the first to break with the metal-back styling of phones since the OnePlus 3 and opt for a glass enclosure front and rear.\u0026nbspThis looks as smart and stylish as the last model – which is very stylish, by the way –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspalthough it\u0027s a little thicker from front to back (8.2mm instead of the OnePlus 6\u0027s 7.8mm), it feels very comfortable in the hand, not least because it\u0027s narrower than the last model.Still, it squeezes in a bigger 6.4-inch display\u0026nbspbecause the screen proportions are different: This is a 19.5:9 ratio screen. There\u0027s a notch at the top, but it\u0027s pretty minimal, like a drop of water when it\u0027s just about to gain enough critical mass to drip from the bathroom tap, no bigger than that. It looks cute.This teardrop notch is one obvious change. The second comes when you flip the phone over. Unlike on the OnePlus 6, there\u0027s no fingerprint sensor just below the dual cameras.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

Pick up the phone and the fingerprint icon lights up on the dark screen. Touch it, and it responds with a neat animation, like a fizzing electrical sphere, and unlocks to the home screen. It feels like the future.Huawei has a similar technology, though a less glitzy special effect, on the Huawei Mate 20. Huawei\u0027s feels just that bit quicker, but this is far from slow. It\u0027s not as fast as a conventional fingerprint sensor, but at least there\u0027s the cute animation to entertain you –\u0026nbspand it\u0027s still only a fraction of a second.Also, it sits in just the perfect place, right at the bottom of the display, in the middle, while the Mate 20 Pro sensor is quite a bit higher.That other Chinese brand, Xiaomi, also has an in-screen fingerprint sensor on its new Mi 8 Pro handset, though that requires a little more pressure.Top tip: when you\u0027re enrolling your fingerprint, think about what angle you\u0027ll actually be unlocking it from. My vertical thumb print wasn\u0027t very effective. I registered it again coming at it from the angle that it turns out I would actually pick the phone up by and it worked like a dream.OnePlus has beaten smartphone heavyweights Apple and Samsung to introduce an in-screen fingerprint sensor (OnePlus)Overall, the fingerprint unlock is pretty reliable, though it doesn\u0027t work as consistently as, say, Face ID on the iPhone XS. But it does the job more than nine times out of ten, so enough to keep you coming back to it rather than turning to the other ways to unlock the phone, such as facial recognition (consistent but not as much fun) or tapping in a PIN code.When it unlocks, you get to see the display in all its glory. It covers 86 per cent of the front of the phone. You can even obscure the notch if you want, or at least set it so the display colours itself black on either side of it, so it blends in. But with such a pretty notch, why would you hide it? Well, only because it gives the screen a little more symmetry, near-matching bezels at top and bottom, it suddenly looks like.The 6.41-inch display on this phone is bright and colourful, looking eye-searingly vivid in some wallpapers (which I love the look of, by the way). The wallpapers even bear the OnePlus slogan of Never Settle, a reminder of the plucky Chinese brand\u0027s positive attitude.It\u0027s a pin-sharp OLED screen, with 401 pixels per inch, that\u0027s the same as the iPhone 8 Plus and rather more than the iPhone XR. And it has OnePlus specialities like reading mode which turns the screen monochrome as though it were a Kindle.\u0026nbspIt completely dominates the front of the phone and you\u0027ll be glad to know it\u0027s robust –\u0026nbspit\u0027s made of Gorilla Glass 6.OnePlus mobile phones are seen on display during a press briefing in Mumbai, India, July 31, 2018 (REUTERSFrancis Mascarenhas)As far as the rear of the phone is concerned, there are two finishes to choose from, Midnight Black (it means matte black) and Mirror Black (it means, oh, you can work it out). Both are attractive.One of the most interesting things about the design is what\u0027s not there:\u0026nbspThe headphone jack. OnePlus is hardly alone in dropping this connection but nonetheless it\u0027s something that many fans have not been happy about, not least because the company championed the headphone jack one the OnePlus 6. Mind you, it means the phone has a bigger battery than last time, which on balance, is a decent trade-off.OnePlus hasn\u0027t introduced waterproofing here, either, something which is a real boon in technology generally. So, don\u0027t drop it in the bath. And, be warned, this phone can feel slippy in the hand.Something else that\u0027s absent is wireless charging. Now, scores of phones have had this capability and until recently it\u0027s gone largely unused. But the truth is that wireless charging pads are an unsung hero of the tech world, providing a genuine improvement in convenience that, once used, is hard to give up on.Wireless charging is especially good at disguising limited battery life because the simplicity of putting it on a pad feels much less of a commitment than digging out the right cable and plugging it in.So, although the company hasn\u0027t ruled wireless charging out for future phones, it\u0027s a shame it\u0027s not here now. Especially as the rear of the phone is glass, not metal.\u0026nbspStill, OnePlus prides itself on charging the battery fast, and that\u0027s definitely the case with the OnePlus 6T, which quickly goes from empty to enough to get through a day in around half an hour. That\u0027s part of the argument against wireless charging, of course, that it\u0027s not as fast.Battery life is strong with a full charge leaving you with a third of a battery by the end of the day, often more. As mentioned, this battery is bigger than on the OnePlus 6.Performance is good, too, thanks to the fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip and plenty of RAM to keep everything speeding along. It has the latest version of Android on board, Android Pie 9.0. OnePlus uses its own Oxygen OS set-up which is accessible and attractive.The camera is a crucial element on every smartphone now and I found the OnePlus 6T camera to be a moderate improvement on the last model. The hardware is the same, but algorithms and software have been enhanced to better photograph faces, text, food and night scenes, OnePlus says.The front camera is high-resolution, 16MP, and has similarly had a software uptick to make selfies sharper.The rear camera hardware is good - a pair of sensors with 16MP and 20MP resolution respectively - but sometimes I found the images were low on detail in places. Low light was less of a problem than on many phones but I didn\u0027t feel the camera quite on the level of the best in the market, such as the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and iPhone XS. Then again, those phones cost a lot more.Which is a part of the story for OnePlus. Although the latest phone is not as super-cheap as its handsets were when it first arrived on the scene, the price ticket here, £499, is impressive. Especially since the storage on board is 128GB, where many rivals have 64GB as standard, still.Camera apart, there\u0027s not much you miss out on with this phone (well, wireless charging and a headphone jack but they aren\u0027t dealbreakers) and there are some elements, such as the in-screen fingerprint sensor, which hardly any other phones can match. Add to that the strong performance, great battery life and fast recharge, and the OnePlus 6T is a deeply appealing choice.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling dropped more than 0.3 per cent against the greenback to $1.3021, and fell 0.21 per cent against the euro to €1.1471.

While growth for the third quarter on the whole was lifted by 0.6 per cent - the fastest rate since 2016 - economists said this was likely to be a one-off. With “persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters”, according to Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce. Meanwhile, Schroders senior European economist Azad Zangana said the economy is not forecast to pick up in the near term. “We expect UK fourth quarter growth to be very weak as Brexit paralysis truly takes hold,” he said. “Assuming the government can successfully negotiate the withdrawal agreement with Brussels and ratify it in Parliament, then we could see a rebound in growth early next year. “However, a failure to complete a deal which would mean a no-deal or cliff-edge Brexit, is likely to cause a further slowdown in activity, which could be enough to tip the UK into recession.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Check out our handy tips for dealing with the demand:1) Make sure you are ready and waiting with the web page up at least five minutes before sales open on Saturday at 10:30am.\u0026nbsp2) Do not let your computer, phone or whatever device holds the key to your happiness run out of battery.\u0026nbsp3) Register your details with the website you are booking from in advance, if you can, but don’t panic if you haven’t left enough time as your tickets will be held while you fill out your information4) Check how many tickets you are allowed to buy in one purchase. If you try to buy more than the limited number, your booking may be cancelled without notice, meaning no-one gets to go.5) Get your friends to try too, but stay in contact in case you all succeed and end up with a bunch of tickets you didn’t want. If you do need to sell any on, do so at face value. No-one likes a tout.6) Be patient and avoid refreshing or switching between browsers. Stick with one tab and have some faith!

The Queen and the massed ranks of the old British establishment will gather, as ever, for the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph, exactly a century after guns finally fell silent on the western front.This being a special anniversary, there’s also a special Songs of Praise\u0026nbspfrom\u0026nbspthe BBC (which in 1918 was still four years away from its birth, and so couldn’t cover the actual arrival of peace). This is followed by Home Front Heroes, in which celebrities, inevitably, reflect on the family’s wartime history. Then there’s another service at Westminster Abbey, plus a special documentary about that installation of ceramic poppies at the Tower of London in 2014.\u0026nbspBut the televisual guns do not fall silent, such is the abiding fascination with the “war to end all wars”. There’s 100 Year of the RAF, tail-end johnnies flying in on Friday night and Dan Cruickshank’s Monuments of Remembrance on Tuesday, which tells the story of the architecture of all those gracious cemeteries and memorials that have been such centres of attention again.\u0026nbspPeter Jackson’s astonishing WW1 documentary is like no otherProbably the best, and most original, of the many documentaries devoted to the First World War is They Shall Not Grow Old. This is more of a feature film in fact, created as it is by Peter Jackson (best known for directing the Lord of the Rings trilogy). You may have seen the advance publicity: original film has been cleaned up, colourised, converted to 3D and rendered with an almost contemporary look. Thus that faded, jumpy black-and-white conflict is transformed into something that might have been videoed last week (not that we have any shortage of wars nowadays anyway).Of course, something of the same has been done with The Second World War in Colour and similar series, but nothing as ambitious as this, nor so well put together with audio from old soldiers’ remembrances. Even those suffering from a touch of war weariness after four years of anniversary broadcasting will appreciate the depth of effort that has gone into this. Now all we have to do is get ready for the 1939-45 show.People Just Do Nothing was, and is, one of the funniest things to come out of Hounslow, or anywhere.\u0026nbspIt’s about a bunch of idiots in a UK garage (or something) crew who run a pirate radio station. The police raided them at the end of that last series but, as one of the mugs tells us in this (sadly) the final series, the audience was so pitifully small that he virtually let them off. By the way, a feature film is on the way, plus a tour or two.\u0026nbspBBC3 (BBC)In mockumetary style, PJDN is a superbly scripted and enacted chronicle of fecklessness, corruption (ironically or not), drug abuse, evil, delusion and, above all, astonishing stupidity. It’s hard to pick out one of them who are last among equals, so to speak, but I suppose it has to be the scene-stealing Chabbuddy G, aka the Mayor of Hounslow, aka the Brown Casanova, aka the Ultrapaneer, aka Alan Brown Sugar, aka Asim Chaudhry. By the way, Chabuds has a girthy book out, “How To Be a Man”, in such he celebrates his success, especially as a lover: “Hey, sugar face, wanna make some beige babies and live the Ukip nightmare?”Chabuds joins MC Grindah (Allan Mustafa), Mish (Lily Brazier) CJ Beats (Hugo Chegwin), and DJ Steves (Steve Stamp) also try to pit their minuscule wits against a hostile world. So bad are they at it that the BBC has even promoted them to BBC2, from their previous existence on BBC3, which transformed itself into a mighty digital comedy incubator when most\u0026nbspexpected it to curl up and die (This Country and Murder in Successville were other great achievements).\u0026nbspThis week Kurupt FM try to replace their pirate radio kit that the police confiscated. In a small homage to Only Fools and Horses,\u0026nbspChabuddy styles himself as Dahl Boy goes hustling. The genius of the British has always been improvisation...I can easily recommend The Little Drummer Girl, which maintains its high standards in this, the third episode. Obviously, rather like the real-life Mossad officers and Palestinian terrorists that feature at the heart of this drama, I can’t reveal too much about what you’re going to see, but you may rest assured it is gripping, beautifully shot and stylishly acted, with standout performances from Michael Shannon (Israeli spymaster Martin Kurtz) and Florence Pugh (a high-tensile alloy of petulance and steel as the reluctant spyterrorist).Though I suppose nothing will surpass the 1979 dramatisation of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, this Le Carre dramatisation is certainly a fine piece of craft, on a par with The Night Manager. Fine viewing, then: no secret about that.Carre\u0026nbspbook (BBC)The animal kingdom is full of endearing creatures that are more or less endangered. (In fact we homo sapiens are actually the most pathetic, seeing as we know we will die out because we’re killing our own planet, but can’t be bothered to do much about it. But I digress.)There can be few more charming things on four trotters than the tapir, and specifically the rare Malaysian tapir, which is basically a pig with a gigantic schnozzle. They look stupid, and they are, and the pair featured in The Secret Life of the Zoo don’t even seem too much keen on mating.

There is simply no excuse – either for Labour as a whole, or for inidual Labour MPs – not to oppose this agenda and give the people a final say.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

The issue now has to be how we bring people together, bring people together around the principles of our economy, our rights and that we don\u0027t turn this country into some kind of offshore tax haven on the lines that Donald Trump might want us to.”On Friday, he told the German newspaper Der Spiegel: “We can\u0027t stop it. The referendum took place. Article 50 has been triggered. What we can do is recognise the reasons why people voted Leave.”On the Andrew Marr programme, Ms Thornberry attacked the prime minister for asking MPs to choose between “the devil and the deep blue sea”.“You cannot simply come to the House of Commons with a bit of nonsense that makes no sense,” she said.Second cabinet minister rejects key part of May\u0027s Brexit planPreparations made for hospital food shortages if no-deal BrexitEU leaders say key Brexit issues still not resolved“You cannot expect the Labour Party to save you from your own backbenchers who are saying this deal makes no sense – and everybody knows it doesn\u0027t make sense.”However, she was forced to concede that the EU had given no indication it would meet Labour’s wish for the “exact same benefits” as the single market and customs union post-Brexit.Asked if the party had had a “serious conversation” with a senior EU official who had indicated that, she replied: “Oh, no, no, no, no, of course not.“But what we\u0027ve had are discussions and they know what it is that we want, and they know we are democrats and if they were in our position they\u0027d be trying to negotiate exactly the same way as we are.”Ms Thornberry rejected the suggestion that Labour was indulging in the same fantasy politics as leading Brexiteers, insisting: “It is not a fantasy prospectus.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?\u0026nbspBen Chu\u0026nbspexplainsClick to followIndy PoliticsFrench lessons? France has a 35-hour working week, implemented in 2000Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, has been making encouraging noises about the idea of a four-day working week for some months now.\u0026nbspAnd this week things seemed to move on a bit further for the opposition party as it was reported that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has spoken to the cross-bench peer Lord Skidelsky about the possibility of an inquiry into the topic.\u0026nbspBut what’s the argument for such a reform? How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?Why would we want to move to a four-day week?Many advocates cite greater work-life balance. Working one fewer day a week would free workers up to look after children, elderly parents or simply to have more leisure time.But Mr McDonnell has talked about the move in terms of productivity – or a worker’s output per hour.He argues that British workers work the longest hours in Europe and yet are among the least productive.Give workers four-day week and more pay, unions sayThe four-day week could transform our lives and our economy Schools consider four-day week in cost cutting driveThat’s\u0026nbspborne out by the data we have.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u0026nbspestimates that UK workers put in an average of 1,681 hours a year in 2017. That compared\u0026nbspwith 1,514 in France and 1,356 in Germany.\u0026nbspYet the Office for National Statistics calculates that GDP per worker in the UK is lower than both those countries.Labour’s lesson seems to be that one way to boosting our weak national productivity is actually to give people less time in the workplace to encourage them to work more efficiently while they are there.\u0026nbspWhile this might sound fanciful it’s not totally outlandish. One recent study from New Zealand showed that when workers moved to a four-day week at one firm their per-hour productivity did indeed rise.The argument is that a better work-life balance makes people more motivated, perhaps by reducing productivity-sapping illness and stress.How could it be implemented?This is a key question. For whatever the theoretical merits of a four-day week for productivity, ordering the entire economy to shift immediately to such a radically different working time structure would clearly be massively disruptive.Angela Merkel’s economic success may be more about luck than strategyEmployers would have to reconfigure shift patterns dramatically, in some cases having to hire many more workers. Think in particular of public services like schools and the health services. Think of the retail and transport sectors.\u0026nbspAlso, around 15 per cent of the UK workforce is now self-employed. It’s hard to see how the state could practically compel those 5\u0026nbspmillion self-employed workers to limit their working week to four days.One policy possibility\u0026nbspa Labour inquiry might consider is whether\u0026nbspto offer tax breaks or other kinds of support to firms that offer four-day working to employees, hoping that this could\u0026nbspencourage the practice to spread.What would be the impact on the economy?That would depend to a large degree on those productivity effects.\u0026nbspThe size of the economy is the value of the output of goods and services produced over a certain period. Working fewer hours would, as a first order effect, seem likely to reduce the volume of those goods and services, thus contracting the economy.\u0026nbspBut if we could produce more of that output in a given period that negative impact would be mitigated, perhaps even wiped out altogether.And\u0026nbspeconomies are dynamic too.\u0026nbspIf we could increase our productivity\u0026nbspgrowth rate\u0026nbspthrough a shorter working week the economy could, theoretically, be larger over the long run.\u0026nbspCritics argue that the productivity impacts are unproven, and that France, with its 35-hour week, has higher unemployment and a more rigid labour market than the UK, something that seems to be particularly unfair on young people.Yet it’s also worth noting that in the late 1900s UK workers put in on average more than 2500 hours a year, almost 50 per cent more than today. But our economy is far larger than it was then due to productivity growth.\u0026nbspThe big-picture historical lesson is that it’s certainly not impossible for average living standards to rise even as average hours worked falls.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But foreign female fans have been allowed to attend some games.Daughters of the revolution: The Iranian women fighting the hijabThe women joined in with chanting in support of Persepolis, Iran’s best-supported club.In March, 35 women were detained for trying to attend a match between Persepolis and another Tehran team.However, in June women were allowed to watch their national team play in the World Cup against Spain.And last month about 100 women were allowed to watch a friendly between Iran and Bolivia, but restrictions were quickly reinstated.Created with Sketch.Iran protests – in pictures Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.University students at an anti-government protest inside Tehran University, 30 December 2017A university student at a protest inside Tehran University while a smoke grenade is thrown by anti-riot Iranian police, 30 December 2017University students at a protest inside Tehran University, 30 December 2017University students run away from the police during an anti-government protest inside Tehran University, 30 December 2017An image grab taken from a handout video released by Iran\u0027s Mehr News agency reportedly shows a group of men pulling at a fence in a street in Tehran, 30 December 2017Demonstrators gather to protest in Tehran, 30 December 2017Iranians chant slogans as they march in support of the government near the Imam Khomeini grand mosque in Tehran, 30 December 2017Iranians chant slogans as they march in support of the government near the Imam Khomeini grand mosque in Tehran, December 30 2017 Iranian clerics take part during a state-organized rally against anti-government protests in the country, in the holy city of Qom, south west Iran, 3 January 2018In this photo provided by the Iranian Students\u0027 News Agency, a clergyman takes a picture of a pro-government demonstration in the southwestern city of Ahvaz, Iran, 3 January 2018Pro-government demonstrators gather at the Massoumeh shrine in Iran\u0027s holy city of Qom, some 130 kilometres south of Tehran, 3 January 2018University students at an anti-government protest inside Tehran University, 30 December 2017A university student at a protest inside Tehran University while a smoke grenade is thrown by anti-riot Iranian police, 30 December 2017University students at a protest inside Tehran University, 30 December 2017University students run away from the police during an anti-government protest inside Tehran University, 30 December 2017An image grab taken from a handout video released by Iran\u0027s Mehr News agency reportedly shows a group of men pulling at a fence in a street in Tehran, 30 December 2017Demonstrators gather to protest in Tehran, 30 December 2017Iranians chant slogans as they march in support of the government near the Imam Khomeini grand mosque in Tehran, 30 December 2017Iranians chant slogans as they march in support of the government near the Imam Khomeini grand mosque in Tehran, December 30 2017 Iranian clerics take part during a state-organized rally against anti-government protests in the country, in the holy city of Qom, south west Iran, 3 January 2018In this photo provided by the Iranian Students\u0027 News Agency, a clergyman takes a picture of a pro-government demonstration in the southwestern city of Ahvaz, Iran, 3 January 2018Pro-government demonstrators gather at the Massoumeh shrine in Iran\u0027s holy city of Qom, some 130 kilometres south of Tehran, 3 January 2018Open Stadiums, a group that campaigns for access to venues for women in Iran, handed a petition to Fifa this week signed by more than 200,000 people.Ending the exclusion “has been our dream for decades”, a spokeswoman\u0026nbspfor the group told the agency. “We are also excluded from public happiness and excitement.”Kashima beat Persepolis 2-0 on aggregate.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

It uses the Snapdragon 845 processor and runs on a customised version of Google\u0027s Android operating system.All are features found on rival high-end phones that can cost more than £700, but Xiaomi is to sell the Mi 8 Pro starting at £499, as part of a strategy it calls honest pricing.Xiaomi opens Mi Stores in UK and USWang Xiang, the firm\u0027s senior vice president, said: Today we witness a new chapter in Xiaomi\u0027s global expansion journey, underpinned by our global ambitions.We are thrilled to make great strides by announcing our arrival in the UK.By bringing a range of our amazing products at honest pricing we want to offer more choices and let everyone in the UK enjoy a connected simple life through our innovative technology.The company will face stiff competition to establish itself in a crowded market, with three new iPhones, two Google Pixel 3 handsets and devices from Samsung, Sony and fellow Chinese firms Huawei and OnePlus being released in recent months.As well as the Pro, Xiaomi will also launch its budget Redmi 6A device for £99, which it claims has a battery that can last for up to 19 days.The Chinese firm is also bringing a range of its other gadgets to the UK, including its Band 3 wearable fitness tracker and an electric scooter.These products will go on sale in a physical Xiaomi Mi store, which will open at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd\u0027s Bush, London, on November 18.Mobiles expert Ru Bhikha said the firm\u0027s arrival in the UK should be taken seriously.Since releasing its first smartphone in August 2011, Xiaomi has rapidly gained a strong foothold in the market - so much so that it\u0027s already the fourth largest handset manufacturer in the world, he said.Xiaomi\u0027s highly anticipated arrival in the UK therefore threatens to put a big cat amongst the pigeons - by combining top tier design and performance with relatively modest pricing, it poses a real threat to the market.Looking at Xiaomi\u0027s success so far, it\u0027s hard to see how its winning combination of high-end smartphones with lower-than-expected prices won\u0027t drive similar results over here.Thursday\u0027s launch marks the arrival of a significant new kid on the block, and there is no doubt that in finally coming to the UK, Xiaomi means business.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was the largest democratic exercise that we have seen.Coventry was above the national average, and around 56 per cent voted to leave.We have got to follow through with that referendum.

Things don\u0026rsquot happen overnight.

Should parents be worried  Absolutely, say the experts.The National Crime Agency estimates that about , people in the UK pose a threat of some kind to children online — and the number is rising all the time.It adds there has been a  per cent increase in the referrals it has received about people uploading images of child sexual abuse since .Just as alarming is the damaging effect that smartphones and social media have on children’s mental health.According to Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University, the number of US teens who took their own lives increased by  per cent between  and .And , like me, you have a teenage daughter there is even more reason to be worried.Compared to the early s, nearly twice as many American teenage girls now end their own lives. In the UK, a quarter of -year-old girls experienced signs of depression, according to a study of , young people.Overall, Professor Twenge found that the generation she calls “iGen” — those born after  — are much more likely  to suffer from mental health issues than their millennial predecessors.“What happened that so many more teens, in such a short period of time, would feel depressed, attempt ­suicide and commit suicide ” she asks. “The sudden rise of the smartphone.”If you’re not convinced by the advice of the experts, just look at the behaviour of the people who’ve made their fortunes from peddling this digital crack cocaine.Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft, stopped his children from owning a phone until they were  and the late Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, would not let his kids play on iPads — even though he invented them.Apple recently introduced a new update that tells you how much time you are spending on your screen each day.That’s a step in the right direction, but don’t expect the company to do too much more. Last year, Apple sold nearly a quarter of a billion iPhones, helping to make it the world’s most valuable brand.The leaders of the tech giants are enriching themselves beyond their ­wildest dreams — not just at our expense but at the expense of our children.So it’s pretty clear they won’t be doing anything to help.

But it will be flawed –– and Mrs May should say so.I admit this sounds odd: Why would a Prime Minister admit that a deal they have negotiated isn’t great ButMrs May tries to say that this agreement is perfect, and that there is no risk of any part of the UK getting stuck in the backstop — which would leave it in an EU customs union but with no say over the trade deals the EU is doing — then she will easily be disproved.Mrs May should take a leaf out of the book of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who as a hugely successful trial lawyer knows a fair bit about persuading people of his case.He told Cabinet on Tuesday that when it came to quitting the backstop “a unilateral right would give the UK greater scope to establish its case, as the other side would have to prove the contrary”.But he went on to acknowledge that negotiating a unilateral right to get out of the backstop was highly unlikely in the time available and a mutual review mechanism could be made to work.Cox’s essential argument is about managing risk. Every option on Brexit now carries with it risk.The challenge is to work out how to best manage these risks. The risk with accepting a legally binding backstop in the withdrawal agreement is that the UK ends up being unable to get out of it cleanly.It would be direthe UK ended up leaving the EU in a way that tied it to the EU for ever.But set against this must be the risk of no deal, and the disruption that would cause. To make matters worse, the Government has done absurdly little to mitigate no deal.The reason that even Cabinet ministers who loathe where the negotiations are heading do not want to go for no deal is they know how unprepared the country is for it.At the same time, there is a risk thatthere is no deal, Parliament would either insist on a second referendum — that would harden isions and toxy our politics — or cancel the process altogether, creating a dangerous democratic deficit.Frankly, the argument that Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement is less bad than the alternatives will be pretty much the only thing going for it.It will be hard for her to make this argument as so many of the deal’s problems are self-inflicted.She triggered Article  without knowing what the UK wanted she has wasted much of the past  months in a negotiation with her own Cabinet the failure to plan properly for no deal has weakened the Government’s negotiating position.Even the Parliamentary arithmetic has been made worse by Mrs May. If she hadn’t called that election, there would be a Tory majority and she wouldn’t be so reliant on the DUP.But it is the argument that her deal is less bad than the alternatives that is keeping the Cabinet on board and it is her best — and, possibly, only — way of getting the House of Commons to vote for such a flawed agreement.THE bad news for Theresa May is that it doesn’t get any easier once she’s got a deal with Brussels.For she will still have to get this withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons.With the DUP unhappy and  Tory Brexit ultras expected to vote against the deal, as well as Jo Johnson and other Tories who want another referendum, it will be extremely tough to get it over the line.“I can’t quite see where the majority comes from,” admits one Cabinet minister.But there is growing talk that the way to get the deal through might be to bring it back a second time, with the markets – which expect a deal – freaking out.As this Secretary of State says: “Do you get it through the first time  Maybe not.He did little to hide his irritation at being moved from his job as universities minister because of his opposition to Mrs May’s plan to tinker with tuition fees.But his resignation is a blow to the PM – and not just because of his attack on her for “a failure of British statecraft not seen since the Suez crisis”.His departure will put more pressure on those ministerial colleagues who privately share his view that a second referendum is needed, to go.With both Johnsons voting against the withdrawal agreement, it will become even harder to get it through the Commons.SO will any of the Cabinet resign over Theresa May’s Brexit plan  At the moment, ministers believe not.One of those who spoke against the May approach at Cabinet tells me the mood of the meeting was “resigned rather than resigning”.Another predicts critics of what Mrs May is doing “will make their point, then retreat”.This is not to say people are happy. Penny Mordaunt, the International Development Secretary, warned that voters wanted a “definitive end point to Brexit” andthey didn’t get it, that risked “feeding a narrative of betrayal, fuelling Ukip”.In private, ministers rail against Mrs May and the way she is handling the negotiations. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been heard to complain that the UK is making it far too obvious it is in a desperate hurry to get a deal.It is certainly true that by advertising its need for a quick agreement, the UK is almost inviting the EU to ask for more.Tellingly, there is renewed – and increasing – talk among ministers of having a new leader in place to do the next set of negotiations.There is little love for the backstop. And interestingly, Chancellor Philip Hammond argued in Cabinet this week it would be better to extend the transition than trigger the backstop.He argued that the backstop could do damage to supply chains and said “it could be better to extend the implementation period than have a bad backstop”.A problem with extending the implementation period is that it would mean free movement would continue – and the UK would still be sending huge amounts of money to Brussels every year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I just thought they were wonderful.”Hamish, from Edinburgh, joined the Black Watch shortly after his th birthday when war broke out in , despite having a heart condition.All siblings Robert and Rosemary had to remember him by was a photo in their gran’s house — and the family always seemed reluctant to speak about their fallen relative, as many were after the war.Robert, , said: “When Rosie and I were kids we used to stay with granny, Isabel Mann, in Edinburgh and we’d say, ‘Well, who is this person ’She was obviously very upset about it even then, which would be  or .“But nothing was ever forthcoming. It was simply he died in the war.”It wasn’t until years later, when the siblings were clearing out their mum’s house in Peeblesshire, Scotland, following her move to a nursing home, they came across Hamish’s trunk.Rosemary, , said: “We found few bits and pieces that were of great interest, the main one being the trunk with Hamish’s things it.”With the house sale imminent, the pair were under pressure to clear the property — and were close to selling all the contents of the loft for just £, despite one box they found being left unopened.Dad-of-two Robert said: “On the last day I said, ‘yikes, we still haven’t dealt with that box’. So that was the moment critique.”Rosemary, a music teacher in Edinburgh, opened the box to discover notebooks and letters belonging to their great-uncle Hamish Mann.She took everything home and tried to make some sense of all the papers.She said: “All the papers were mixed up so you might begin reading a poem and find it finished halfway.And the next piece of paper you came across was part of a funny play he’d written at school. I laid all out on the floor and for several months didn’t do much .”They turned to friend and writer Jacquie, who started researching Hamish’s background.She discovered he’d been ill as a child suffering from an enlarged heart, also known as cardio myopathy.The author said: “He was bedridden for a good year during which time he wrote about a hundred poems or so.He made good use of his bedridden time but it was very hard for him.”Jacquie found out he’d worked for a repertory company as a teenager and performed on the Lyceum Stage in Edinburgh, where he also wrote a number of plays.And an old copy of Stage Magazine revealed he’d been named one of their playwrights of the year aged just .A year after he received the theatrical honour, war broke out.It was almost impossible in many cases to distinguish between the dead and the living, so motionless did the latter lie in their exhaustion, after the terrible work of taking the trench. Some of the bodies were dreadful, seated on the floor of the trench in natural positions, their faces fallen back, upturned, ghostly-white, cheeks sunken, teeth gleaming through the grin of death that had parted their pale lips.Others were face-downwards, clots of blood on their unorms, gashed and bedraggled, half sunk in the mud — just as they had fallen in that last supreme moment. A few were terribly mangled.One had had his body from the waist upwards blown completely away, and the poor, pitul legs were lying against the sloping parados of that unspeakable trench.Wounded were littered everywhere, and it rent one’s heart to hear them moan and rave in the delirium of their suffering, or cry aloud as someone stumbled against them in the dark. It was impossible not to do this, for many of these wretched men were almost smothered in the sucking slimeStill we filed along, all but sickened by the nauseating stench of decomposing human bodies, a distinctive smell which is even now in my nostrils.Hamish — real name Alexander James — was  but his health condition meant he didn’t have to sign-up.Instead, he lied on forms about his fitness, sought a second opinion from medics and went to war.Rosemary said: “He always said he wasn’t so interested in being a soldier, but he was a patriot and always wanted to do his best for his country, so had this huge sense of duty.He had one consultant who failed him and said his heart wasn’t up to it. However, he tried again.“I think the doctor on that day didn’t have the time to go into things in too much depth and he said, ‘this time I got by’.After signing up, he was sent to Northern France in , arriving first in the Somme before being stationed throughout the region, including billets at Gouy-Servins and Mingoval.He wrote his last poem on the morning of April , after musing about his fallen friends and wonderinghe’d be next.Three days later his battalion marched to Arras, their objective was to capture the enemy’s front line.But Hamish was hit full force by a German shell and he died on the battlefield.The book has brought together Hamish’s story along with his poetry penned from the heart of the conflict and his other works.Jacquie added: “You feel you are there with him. And that is not always a good thing.But you do and it makes such a dference. And he was so young.”Hamish’s family are so proud to have been abe to piece together his work and bring it to a new audience.Rosemary said: “We all felt that it was our duty to honour him by doing something about all this writing.We’re so pleased and relieved people are showing an interest in the book.”Robert, now based in Eastbourne, East Sussex, and a retired purchasing manager, said: added: “He is one of millions of soldiers who died in that war and as a very young person I suppose I just always thought, well this is just another one.“I say that not flippantly but how do you draw attention to one of millions of people who died in the war “However, he just had something  for the world to know.”Muddy Trench: A Sniper’s Bullet: Hamish Mann, Black Watch, Officer-Poet, -, by Jacquie Buttriss is out on hardback on November  priced £"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000447769554.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"stop praying silence from charles","story":"But close your eyes and imagine, for a moment, knowing from childhood exactly what job you are going to do — because you have no choice about whether or not you actually want to do it.And imagine, then, having to wait for that job to start until you are the age when most people are hanging up their work boots and starting to claim a pension.It’s impossible, right  But the Prince of Wales — the man who was born to be king — has known since the age of four that he would one day have to step into his mother’s shoes. And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink. Still, they are yet to speak out – or apologise.What beggars belief is not just that these sick men thought that no one would notice nor care when this footage emerged on social media – but really that they are unhinged enough to do it in the first place.I’m pretty sure about one thing, though. No matter what consequences they will face for their actions from the law, they will never, ever live this down in the eyes of the world – and nor should they.I’m talking about Michael Douglas, . When he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for more than  years in the entertainment industry, he gave his father, Kirk, a kiss on the lips to celebrate.In my experience there comes an age when your kids don’t want to kiss you – particularly on the lips and particularly your dad.It’s part and parcel of growing up that your kids don’t even want you to breathe, let alone kiss them.In fact, everything you do embarrasses them. But, given that Kirk Douglas is , maybe it’s just a reminder that things come full circle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His muscles stopped working.“I went to hospital and they thought it might be my appendix. So they took that out,” he told news.au from Brisbane.Doctors were wrong. Within hours he was in the back of an ambulance, stripped naked, covered in ice to reduce his soaring temperature.Liam’s body was shutting down because the slug he swallowed was carrying a parasitic worm.When the slug died, the worm found a new home in his spinal cord and “basically ate its way up to my brain”.The now--year-old fell into a coma. Doctors at Royal Brisbane Hospital kept him in the coma for four weeks and pumped his body full of steroids. They told his mother to “plan his funeral” and that he had a one-in- million shot at surviving.Then he woke up - a shadow of his former self.“When I went in, I weighed kg. When I came out of the coma, I was kg. My thigh looked like my wrist, just skin hanging off it,” Liam says.“I had to learn how to eat, speak, walk, everything all over again. I knew how to do it but getting my brain to tell my body how to do it was another thing.”Staff scribbled the alphabet on a whiteboard at RBH alongside the words “yes” and “no”. For weeks Liam would communicate that way. If he wanted water, or the television, or the toilet, he had to spell it out.Speech therapy followed for four months and Year  went out the window. He would eventually repeat, get his certicate, and regain “ per cent” of his former le.This week, he was reminded again how lucky he is.Sam Ballard, , died on Friday surrounded by family in Sydney’s north, eight years after he ate a slug as a dare.Mr Ballard contracted the same disease — eosinophilic meningo-encephalitis — and spent  days in a coma.When he woke, he had an acquired brain injury that meant he needed   care and could not feed himself.“We were sitting over here having a bit of a red wine appreciation night, trying to act as grown up and a slug came crawling across here,” Sam’s friend Jimmy Galvin said.“The conversation came up, you know. ‘Should I eat it ’ And off Sam went. Bang. That’s how it happened.”When news broke that Sam had passed away, Liam’s phone lit up with messages from friends thankful that he didn’t suffer the same fate.“All my friends and family saw Sam’s article and tagged me in it,” Liam says. “I think about it all the time. That could’ve been me.”These days Liam is a happy, healthy house painter. He’s recently married, too. His message is simple: “Hugs not slugs.”“It was stupid but I didn’t think it was dangerous,” he says. “Being  years old, you do stupid things. I’m lucky.”Both Sam and Liam ate slugs that were carrying rat lungworm.The worm is usually found in rodents but molluscs that eat rat excrement can also become infected.The NSW Government’s Department of Health fact sheet reveals that symptoms y from patient to patient.Some people develop no symptoms, others can have mild, short-lived symptoms.“Very rarely, rat lungworm causes an infestation of the brain.

I’ll go to my local church, St Mary’s, where there’s a march with the British Legion and a service. After that there’s tea and cake. I’ll be there with all the old-timers. I’ve been doing this for the past  years now and a lot of the old boys have died. But there are still a few who keep the thing going. The local cubs and scouts march along with them and you realise that the memory of their service will always be kept alive. You look at the Cenotaph and see most of the names on it belong to families still in the area. That brings home the impact of these wars and you realise those who fought in them will never be forgotten. I’m proud my parents served the country in the Second World War.  Dad was a sergeant in the Army. Mum was a welder in a munitions factory and an air raid warden. The military records office, which used to be in my constituency, provided me with my father’s record file. His commanding officer described him as a good soldier, though the record also showed he was fined half a crown for damaging his motorbike. I don’t know much about my grandad. His name was Edward Brunson and he served in the trenches for two years during the First World War. Like most people who fought, neither my dad or grandad liked to talk about what they had done. But I wish I’d asked more questions. You don’t think to do it at the time, but I wish that I had. I do know my dad was billeted after the war with a German family. They wrote to him for several years after he came home. I remember Dad telling me they were people just like us – ordinary, working-class people who were kind and treated him like their own son. That has always stuck with me. What came out of the war was the spirit of  – the determination that things were going to change. We would never go back to mass unemployment and the grinding poverty of the s.  That post-war Labour government was determined to make things better. There was a spirit of reform. Prime Minister Clement Attlee and health secretary Nye Bev- an wanted a country fit for heroes. That led to the creation of the Welfare State and the NHS. Those things were built on the sacrices of our servicemen and women. But look around now and see what’s happened to that vision. After a decade of Tory austerity, all the hard-fought gains of the wartime generation are under attack. Families including shyveterans rely on foodbanks due to brutal Tory cuts. And many veterans are pushed into poverty by Universal Credit. It’s going to get worse. There are billions of pounds worth of social security cuts still to come. As an MP, I have done all I can to support veterans. I’ve taken on cases of people struggling with the horrors of PTSD or other mental health issues. Some were homeless or in prison. As Chancellor, support for our veterans – especially those who have fallen on hard times – will be a priority. We will end this unfairness and austerity. We will give people the respect and support they deserve. That means completing the vision that those generations sacriced so much to make possible: We’ll build a country fit for heroes.

One insider said: “They are shyplanning when exactly is the right time to do it. Jo set the news agenda by releasing his decision on Friday evening. Everyone was a bit surprised. “The logical thing to do would have been to quit after the Brexit Cabinet meeting. So it’s important they get this right.” Mr Johnson, who backed Remain during the  campaign, quit his role as Transport Minister.  In his resignation statement, he said he believed the public should have a second referendum. And he blasted the PM’s handling of Brexit negotiations. Mr Johnson is the sixth minister to quit over Brexit since Mrs May’s January reshuffle. Three were Leavers, including Boris. The others were Remainers. Mr Johnson’s decision piles more pressure on Mrs May, who faces a crunch week in Parliament. Tory MP Anna Soubry, also a Remain campaigner, said: “Jo isn’t the only minister who shares these views and I hope others will follow his lead.” One insider said: “We know there are three ministers in talks but it will be interesting to see what the Cabinet does.  “Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey will be thinking about it.

The causes of the rise in violent crime are extremely complex and involve deep-seated problems like poverty, inequality, social alienation, mental ill-health and a lack of work and opportunities for young people. This has been made far worse by huge Government cuts to the police and preventative services like youth services, local councils and charities. This week the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, admitted for the first time that the police won’t be able to tackle violent crime without more Government funding.  This is welcome, but I’m frustrated that it’s taken two-and-a-half years of banging my head against a wall to get ministers to understand that cuts have consequences. Government cuts have forced the Met Police to make poundbillion of cuts since . Every penny of these cuts, at the very least, needs to be reversedwe are to tackle this scourge of violent crime.

I’ve funded the Met’s new Violence Task Force –  officers dedicated to tackling violent crime in the communities worst affected. I’ve also provided poundmillion as part of my new Young Londoners Fund to support a range of education, sport, cultural and other constructive activities for children and young people.

He said: “I was trained as a machinist for pound. an hour. I still work for pound shysometimes. I have worked in  to  dferent factories. I work  hours, six days a week, sometimes Sundays too. “The most I have earned is pound. but it is normally pound. to pound.. “There are lots of people like me. I’d say that in every factory of  people you would have three or four illegals.”  Leicester has  textile factories which can make a million clothes a week for booming online retailers. Most do comply with the law – but a number of small places ignore the rules. Bosses blame retailers who demand rapid deliveries, impose huge fines for being late and haggle over mere pennies. They also say retailers do not pay them for up to  days and charge for sending back unsold stock. Factory owner Saeed Khilji, chairman of the Textile Manufacturer Association of Leicestershire, employs workers legally but says demand for celeb outfits often drives production. He said: “If an outfit goes viral, retailers race to get their copy online.  “Ten years ago manufacturers could make pound profit from a dress but these days they would be lucky to make p. “None of the retailers are giving us an ethical price. An extra pound or pound. on a garment would sort everything out. Instead they squeeze us for pennies.” He added: “If they don’t sell everything, they send it back and charge us for the carriage. If we are an hour or  minutes late with delivery they fine us pound. I have been told of one retailer who is making poundmillion a year from fines.” Firms have complained that the new “Fast Forward” factory inspections, to which a number of major labels are signed up, is onerous. One said: “They want us to give contracts to our workers but they won’t give us contracts. When they are not busy, the factories can’t survive.”  Alkesh Kapadia, of Barcode Fashion, employs  workers in two factories and pays them the minimum wage. He said: “Retailers threaten, ‘If you can’t do it we will find someone ’. I say, ‘How does that work ’ If I can’t do it, how can anyone  ’” Another manufacturer said: “I used to make pound. to pound profit per garment. Now it might be p.” Two weeks ago the Commons shyEnvironmental Audit Committee heard evidence about sustainability in the fashion industry. Investigative journalist Sarah O’Connor told MPs: “If you go around the high street you will be amazed to see how many dresses say “Made in the UK” but cost pound, pound, pound.  “I wondered, ‘How on earth is this possible ’ The answer is that basically, in a huge chunk of Leicester’s garment industry, labour law does not apply.” Some retailers have joined the Ethical Trading Initiative where shyfactories undergo stricter audits, but others have not. Sarah O’Connor said: “One of the biggest would be Boohoo. They source an awful lot in Leicester. “They are not members of the ETI.” Sarah Ditty, of Fashion Revolution, told MPs: “There are a lot of brands that are not really disclosing any shyinformation about what they are doing.” MPs have called on five leading online-only fashion retailers – Boohoo, Amazon, Asos, PrettyLittleThing and Missguided – to give evidence as part of their inquiry into the industry. Boohoo told the Sunday Mirror it insists on suppliers “acknowledging responsibility” for paying a living wage and conducts third-party audits. It also denied fining for late shydeliveries or ing unsold items and said it pays suppliers within  days. Missguided said: “We’re proud of what we’ve been doing through our membership of the ETI to address industry issues.” ASOS declined to comment but there is no suggestion it does not adhere to industry rules."},{"url":null,"title":"dramatic moment man waving samurai","story":"NewsDramatic moment man waving samurai sword stopped by armed police who Taser himPolice detained the man following the shocking incident on Rectory Road in Basildon, Essex, on Saturday afternoonShareByNeil MurphyHannah Kane:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsArmed police confronted the man outside a pharmacy in Basildon, Essex \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDramatic images show how armed police confronted a man waving a samurai sword in Essex this afternoon.Officers swooped on Rectory Road in Basildon at around .pm on Saturday after being called to the scene over concerns for the welfare of the man.

Disadvantaged Year Six pupils were lagging up to NINE terms behind their peers nationally in certain subjects. Ofsted had graded the school “Inadequate”, slamming weak leadership and low expectations. But in less than four years Sam has reversed its fortunes with a series of clever innovations. One is a forest garden where disruptive kids go to calm down and light cooking fires, plant shyvegetables, look after chickens and play old-fashioned conkers.  Another is a rewards scheme offering treats dreamed up by the children, including football afternoons, chocolate parties and the chance to be “head for the day”, wearing one of Sam’s ties. Emphasis is put on politeness and visitors are ushered through the school by pupils opening doors. In Sam’s first  months, Ofsted upped its grading two places to “Good” and issues including truancy were tackled. In , just a third of the kids were achieving good results in reading, writing and maths. Now seven in ten are hitting their targets. Sam’s approach has changed le for some of the area’s most needy children, including a -year-old so troubled he was on the verge of being expelled from another school and a Year  child who could not cope with more than  minutes a time in the classroom. They are both now full-time at Benjies, as the school is affectionately known. Others in the deprived, low-income district have been helped by the school taking on a family support worker, providing free unorms and running breakfast and young carers clubs. Sam’s efforts were recognised by an acclaimed Pearson national award, School of the Year: Making a Dference, which gets lovingly polished every day.  Sam, now , who had previously taught in Nottingham and worked with under-privileged children in Lincoln, said: “I can’t take all the credit because it’s been a real team effort. “We recognise academic progress is important but we realise lots of building blocks need to be put in place. Many of those involve interventions that help pupils develop socially as well as academically.” He went on: “When I first joined the school I was a little nervous. There were staff members who had been here for years, which was a bit daunting. “I could see the drive and commitment staff had so I kept the same team. I wanted the school and the staff to get the reputation they deserved.” Benjies’ pupils live in one of Britain’s , worst-off districts – Gainsborough South-West Ward – which has high unemployment and crime.  Seven in ten kids are entitled to free school meals and  per cent have special educational needs, compared to a national average of  per cent. But one of the pupils, ten-year-old Keegan, said: “I like this school because they do very good education and Mr Coy always make the teachers do very hard work for the children.” Sam is now working on creating a community hub at the school where families can access debt counselling, housing support and a food bank. He added: “We want the school to be at the heart of the area. All the staff here are incredible and want to do their very best for the pupils – and that is everything.” "},{"url":null,"title":"health food supplements combat arthritis","story":"NewsHealth food supplements to combat arthritis and colds exposed as expensive fakesTrading Standards launched an investigation after complaints that some pills were less effective than othersShareCommentsByStephen Hayward:,  NOV NewsThe pills have been branded useless supplements \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHealth food supplements to combat arthritis and colds have been exposed as expensive fakes.

So imagine how tough it can be when youre serving  roast dinners in each of your restaurants every week and not just the extended family. Thats the task faced every week by the expert chefs of The Toby Carvery. Millions of families sit down to tuck into a delicious roast dinner every week - wherever they are in the world. So ahead of Remembrance Sunday - and in a bid to help readers who tackle the job of cooking the Sunday roast each week - weve brought The Toby Carvery together with the chefs of The Royal Navy to get their top tips in the above video. Toby Carvery - the Home of the Roast - has long been a supporter of the armed forces, offering free meals to troops on Armed Forces Day.  And in the above behind-the-scenes clip on board HMS Northumberland, Toby Carvery Chef Trainer James Smith joins forces with the Royal Navys Chef Mitchell to lt the lid on how best to cook meats, roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings and even gravy. Toby Carvery Chef James hails The Royal Navy for creating that home-from-home roast dinner experience at sea in the clip, saying: For many families, roast dinners are that one time everybody gets around that dining table. A really good roast dinner is just like having a really big hug on a plate!  Meanwhile, The Royal Navys chef Mitchell explains how important the traditional meal is to troops across the world. He adds: Ive cooked for Royalty and some of the biggest dignitaries of the Armed Forces, but every Sunday - guaranteed - ships across the world are having a roast dinner. Below, weve shared the top tips from the guys on the key ingredients to help families across the country cooking up a roast. Meats  Toby Carverys Chef James says: One of the tricks we use at Toby is to bloom our meat for a minimum of four hours first of all. So we take them out of the packaging and that lets the joints re-oxigise. We then load them into ovens and cook them really slowly. Letting them rest at the end is a key step to getting perfect beef. Yorkshire puddings  Were famous for our seven centimetre Yorkshire Puddings at Toby Carvery, reveals chef James. The trick to Yorkshires is making sure youve got really hot oil. Then add your batter to the oil and get them in the oven as quickly as you can. Roast potatoes Its all about the ruffling, chef James says, shaking a tray of uncooked but peeled and chopped spuds.  You want to shake them up and make sure you break the edges of the potatoes up. Then that will give us a really nice, crisp roast potato. Gravy  Chef James says: Theres nothing worse than thin or lumpy gravy! Consider adding cranberry sauce, mustard or horseradish. Meanwhile, The Royal Navys Chef Mitchell adds: We always go for a nice smooth, thick gravy. We normally put in a bit of red wine to give it a dferent taste. Ive even put Marmite in!Find your nearest Toby Carvery at www.tobycarvery"},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton queen wear multiple","story":"NewsWhy Kate Middleton and the Queen wear multiple poppies on Remembrance DayMembers of the Royal Family have been seen wearing more than one poppy on their coatsShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  NOV NewsQueen Elizabeth II \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailToday marks the centenary since the the Armistice was signed, marking the end for the First World War where  million lost their lives. As they do every year, the Royal Family will be paying their respects to the fallen and will wear poppies pinned to their chests like the rest of the nation. However, the Queen and Kate Middleton were spotted wearing clusters of five and three poppies during last nights Remembrance Day eve services at the Royal Albert Hall. This has led to speculation from members of the public about the reason why - and the gesture sends a clear message.  There is continued debate about the politics of wearing poppies pinned to our coats - as some people shun wearing them for a iety of reasons. The Queen and Kates quiet tributes to the fallen speak loud and clear: they will not forget the fallen. One theory is that the Queen wore five poppies to signy each branch of the services. These are the Army, Navy, RAF, Civil Defence and women.  Its also been suggested The Queen wears a bespoke corsage, a single piece made up of five poppies, rather than five inidual flowers. Either way, their clusters of blazing red poppies against the Royals sombre black attire were certainly dficult to miss. The Queen has never openly discussed why she wears so many, but the sentiment is crystal clear. The Royal British Legion shop doesnt sell a set of poppies like the ones worn by the Queen or Kate, but you can create it yourself using a bunch of inidual ones.

The Great War, as the World War I is commonly referred to, is estimated to have contributed to the deaths of  million people worldwide, and is quite fairly seen as the bloodiest war in history. The phrase encapsulates our desire to remember the past tragedy and sacrice and ensure that such bloody catastrophe never happens again. Lest we forget is often said along with the Ode of Remembrance by Laurence Binyons.However, where does the phrase Lest we forget originate from breaks down the use of the historically iconic phrase. Where does Lest we forget come from   The phrase originates in a Victorian poem by writer Rudyard Kipling, who composed it before it was then used to commentate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in , when it was published in The Times. The poem, five stanzas inand comprised of six lines each, was titled Recessional. Recessional seems a repetition of the phrase Lest we forget at the end of each of the first four stanzas. The full poem Recessional by Rudyard Kipling God of our fathers, known of old, Lord of our far-flung battle line, Beneath whose awful hand we hold Dominion over palm and pine— Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget—lest we forget! The tumult and the shouting dies The Captains and the Kings depart: Still stands Thine ancient sacrice, An humble and a contrite heart. Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget—lest we forget! Far-called our navies melt away On dune and headland sinks the fire: Lo, all our pomp of yesterday Is one with Nineveh and Tyre! Judge of the Nations, spare us yet, Lest we forget—lest we forget! If, drunk with sight of power, we loose Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe, Such boastings as the Gentiles use, Or lesser breeds without the Law— Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget—lest we forget! For heathen heart that puts her trust In reeking tube and iron shard, All valiant dust that builds on dust, And guarding calls not Thee to guard, For frantic boast and foolish word— Thy Mercy on Thy People, Lord! The poem is thought to represent the transient nature of the British Empire, and how nothing lasts forever, taking a solemn and grave tone. It is not a poem about war, but its grim realism and lack of jingoism perhaps befits the universal sadness after World War I. Why is it used for Remembrance Day The line Lest we forget, is often added aswere part of the ode For the Fallen by Laurence Binyons, and is repeated in response by those listening, and is particularly popular in Australia. They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemnAt the going down of the sun, and in the morning,We will remember them. A number of Boer War memorials are inscribed with the phrase showing its use pre-World War I. In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, the final line, We will remember them, is often repeated in response. The sense of legacy from the quote Lest we forget and the need to acknowledge sacrice is often why it is included."},{"url":null,"title":"live remembrance sunday ww1 100","story":"NewsRemembrance Sunday live: Prince Charles leads tributes  years after WWs endThe Prince of Wales placed a wreath at the Cenotaph in central London as the Queen watched from a balcony  years on from the Armistice in World War OneShareByChris kitchingUpdated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video queen-observes-two-minutes-silence-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news live-remembrance-sunday-ww-- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"Britons fell silent for two minutes at am as millions around the globe marked  years since the end of the First World War.

Sheku Kanneh-Mason, from Nottingham, played a modern version of Leonard Cohens Hallelujah to a hushed crowd at the Festival of Remembrance. The concert, held at the Royal Albert Hall to commemorate those who fought and lost their lives in the First World War, was attended by the royals including the Queen, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Prince William and Kate Middleton. The young star, who has almost , followers on Twitter, shared a picture of himself backstage with actors Michael Palin, Adrian Lester, Nina Waider and McFlys Tom Fletcher and Danny Jones. The talented cellist, who was the first black musician to win the  BBC Young Musician of the Year award since its launch  years earlier, stunned crowds with his performance.  Sheku wowed guests earlier this year in St Georges Chapel in Windsor with his short set that took place while the royal couple signed the register. He performed Franz Schuberts Ave Maria, Gabriel Faureacutes Apregraves un recircve and Maria Theresia von Paradis Sicilienne. He was asked to perform at the ceremony by Meghan who personally approached him after watching him at a charity event in London.  Speaking just days after the Royal Wedding on the Lorraine Kelly show, he said the performance was one of the few times he had felt jittery about performing. He said: Being there was absolutely amazing. I dont tend to get nervous before performances, but this was unlike anything Id ever done before. It was such a good opportunity to be able to perform for so many people. I really enjoyed the opportunity to to that.  Sheku is the third of the seven gted musical children of Stuart Mason and Kadiatu Kanneh. The youngsters appeared in Britain’s Got Talent in  and Sheku’s two older siblings are also studying in London. He began playing the cello at six, and achieved a top-rank Grade Eight, something most youngsters would expect to achieve in their teens, within three years.Also at the age of nine he entered the RAM’s junior academy.  Sheku was also the subject of the BBC documentary Young, Gted And Classical: The Making Of A Maestro. There were accolades from the Royal Philharmonic Society and the South Bank Sky Arts Awards as well as A-levels in music , maths and physics.Other performers at the Festival of Remembrance included Sir Tom Jones singing Coming In On A Wing And A Prayer alongside the RAF Squadronaires. Sheridan Smith was backed softly by a piano as she sang Are You Just Sleeping, while Tom Fletcher from McFly performed Born To Fly with Danny Jones, which he wrote to celebrate  years of the Royal Air Force.

Hours later baby Alfie was born – and the news was announced at the wedding reception.  Seamstress Hannah said: “I shyreally didn’t want to miss Francesca’s special day. I assured her throughout my pregnancy that I’d be there and I didn’t want to let her down. “On the morning of the shywedding, I got into my bridesmaid’s dress, had my hair done and did my make-up but I had to keep stopping every few minutes because of the painful contractions.

It was a lovely moment and a relief to know everything had gone well.  “Alfie will always be known as the baby that crashed the wedding and I’ll be sure to tell him all about it when he’s older – in fact, I won’t let him forget it! “I went to meet my new nephew the day after I got married and enjoyed giving him a cuddle.”  She added: “It was such good news to hear Hannah was pregnant – I just wished she could have been due a month earlier or later. “Right from the start, I was convinced she would give birth on the wedding day.

Standing before the Queen, Lucy Attrill summed up the mood of a nation with a poem as fitting as any to commemorate the sacrice made for us in the trenches so long ago. “If you hadn’t given your le in France  If you hadn’t stepped on that train  Your boys might have had a father  But our world might not be the same.” Its poignant lines struck the perfect chord. And the title – simply “Thank You” – resounded back down the years amid the reverent silence of London’s Royal Albert Hall. It marked the highlight of a moving service attended by Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as well as other senior royals.  Birmingham schoolgirl Lucy had written the winning poem in a Royal British Legion contest to honour the , British troops who died. Her own great-grandfather George Alfred Attrill was one of the lucky ones. He served in the Royal Navy in both world wars – the second time on a hospital ship – and survived. You grew up too fast, Age twelve you were dumped in a factory, When you should have been in class. You missed out on education, For the good of our world today, Instead, you had to make weapons, That’s a debt we can’t repay. Thank you. You left your le behind, Your we, your children, everything, But your luck was not so kind. If you hadn’t given your le in France, If you hadn’t stepped on that train, Your boys might have had a father, But our world might not be the same. So, to everyone whose le was lost, Or ruined, or halted or messed, You all deserve more thanks than you got, You all deserve the best. Thank you Lucy’s spine-tingling verse was only matched in the domed hall by Prince Harry and Meghan’s royal wedding cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason who played Hallelujah while images from the First World War were projected onto gauze screens above him. Sir Tom Jones, Tom Fletcher, Danny Jones, Sheridan Smith and The Kingdom Choir also performed, with a finale that saw thousands of poppy petals fall from the roof. The festival was one of a series of events yesterday on the eve of the th anniversary of Armistice Day.  Earlier, the Duke of Sussex was at Twickenham to lay a wreath ahead of the rugby clash between England and New Zealand. Harry also met descendants of two England captains Lancelot Slocock and Ronnie Poulton who died in the conflict. Poulton’s great nephew James Garnett said: “It was very emotional.” Yesterday also saw the end of The Long Walk Home, a four-day challenge in which  veterans walked  miles from Ypres in Belgium – the scene of three major battles – to the Cenotaph. Among the walkers was -year-old Pete Barron, a former Lieutenant Colonel with the Royal Corps of Signals for  years, and his stepson Matthew McGinn, , who still serves with the RCS. Pete, of Ludlow, Shrops, carried with him the war medals of his grandfather John Webb who survived the Somme campaign to win a Distinguished Conduct Medal.  And he also had with him a bronze medallion known as the “death penny” given to the family of his Royal Navy great uncle Albert Brown who didn’t make it home. Pete – who has raised pound, for the Haig Housing Trust which provides homes for veterans – said: “I was doing the walk he couldn’t do.” An estimated . million military personnel lost their lives in the First World War and  million were wounded. Among them was -year-old Private George Edwin Ellison from York – killed by a German sniper just  minutes before the Armistice at am on November , , that ended the four-year conflict. Today the leaders of France and Germany joined in a show of unity - holding hands and resting their heads against each other. President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met in Compiegne, France, where the Armistice was signed in a railway carriage. In the UK, silhouettes of soldiers from the First World War were projected on to famous landmarks.  The Tommies illuminated Marble Arch, Tate Modern, HMS Belfast, Warwick Castle, the Angel of the North, the Tyne Bridge, Titanic Belfast, Cardf Castle and Edinburgh Castle. General the Lord Dannatt, patron of There But Not There and ex-Chief of the General Staff, said: “It is vital we reflect on the sacrice made by an entire generation of servicemen and women. These landmarks provide a remarkable representation of the nation doing that. “We have been moved by the overwhelming public support which has led to more than poundmillion raised for military and mental health charities.”  Sunday’s events will begin at am as pipers play the traditional Scottish lament, Battle’s O’er, at , locations across the world. Then at am Britain will fall silent for two minutes. At .pm church bells will ring. And in the evening The Last Post will be sounded by more than , buglers before Beacons of Light are lit from Land’s End to John O’Groats at pm, symbolising an end to the darkness of war.

Hamad Isa Ali al-Khala, , will appear in the High Court this week over claims he reneged on a deal with Egyptian businessman Ahmed Adel Abdallah Ahmed. The -year-old, who runs an events firm, claims the film-mad royal drew up a wish list of  Bollywood stars he was desperate to meet. It was said to include Slumdog Millionaire star Anil Kapoor and former Miss World and Bride and Prejudice star Aishwarya Rai, along with Bunty Walla, Sanjay Dutt, Deepika Padukone and Karishma Kapoor. Mr Ahmed claims he offered to organise one-to-one meetings at locations in Dubai and India. But he said: “In spite of the endless amounts of cash he was willing to spend on his obsession, the payments suddenly dried up.”  Mr Ahmed claims the sheikh – a cousin of the King of Bahrain, who has a net worth of pound.billion – agreed to pay more than pound.million per star meeting. He also claims he agreed each meeting would last no longer than  minutes and the sheikh offered a bonus of pound, for every third successful meeting. However, Mr Ahmed alleges after meeting four actors, including Ranveer Singh and “King Khan” Shah Rukh Khan in , he failed to turn up to two more then backed out, having paid just pound.million.  And he claims the sheikh pulled out of a pound, deal to sponsor The Times of India Film Awards – India’s equivalent of our BAFTAs. Mr Ahmed said: “I was shocked then to find he had met with  shyfurther Bollywood stars in eight days shortly after he terminated our agreement. Given the positive relationship I felt we had built up during our work, I feel betrayed.”  Mr Ahmed is suing for damages arising partly from breach of contract. But Sheikh Hamad’s team denies a formal agreement was ever made. In court papers, the sheikh’s defence claims he was told each shyencounter would cost pound, to pound, but was later told meeting Shah Rukh Khan would cost ten times that amount. He claims Mr Ahmed “put unfair pressure” on him for large sums of money and he felt “threatened”. He also said the meetings were set up at inconvenient times. Sheikh Hamad has declined to comment.

The south of the country finally enjoyed some sunshine today after being battered by days of heavy rain and gales. Wednesday could be the warmest November  since records began in highs beat the .c recorded in Cwmbargoed, Glamorgan, Wales. Highs of up to c on Wednesday will start a week-long warm and mainly dry spell with sunny periods for all.  The high temperatures are caused by El Nino - the warming of eastern Pacic sea-surface temperatures - but this could also bring late winter freezes, as it did in  .But the high temperatures wont last long as the weather it set to go form mild to wild later in the month. The Met Office said a bitter last week of November could bring snow to the north of the country.

The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Glaze said: “Britain’s weather looks like going from mild to wild. “Indian Summer conditions in coming days see C sunny spells challenging date records. “But it is set to turn much colder ahead, and after Christmas is forecast spells of snow, ice and travel disruption, with lows down to -C in parts of Scotland and -C in England.” Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: “Remembrance Sunday had a high chance of showers, with Monday also showery. “But high pressure builds with dry and fine conditions for many southern and eastern areas on Wednesday, spreading to the North as well from Thursday until the weekend, with very mild temperatures and highs around C. “Settled weather continues until November , although there could be low cloud and fog at times. “But the big change ahead is to a colder last week of the month, moving from above to below-average temperatures with the risk of wintry conditions in the North.” The Met Office three-month forecast said that El Nino implies an increase in the likelihood of milder-than-average conditions for the UK.

Debbie Brown says it is a frequent occurrence that her two kids - Callum, , and seven-year-old Cha - will go without an evening meal. The -year-old, from Bootle, Merseyside, was among the first to be moved onto the six-in-one benefit system which is criticised for pushing people further into poverty.She used to work but has suffered with severe depression, anxiety, panic attacks and more recently agoraphobia - meaning she rarely ventures out of her home which she describes as like a prison. And while she wants to recover andto a normal le, she believes the amount of money being offered to people like her is nowhere near enough. In a moving interview, Debbie broke down as she described getting video messages from her daughter telling her to be strong. Have you been affected by Universal Credit  Get in touch webnews@trinitymirror  Debbie said her children were recently forced to share a small amount of porridge for their evening meal. She said: Last night was an absolute nightmare, because my kids were telling me they were hungry and I couldnt do anything, I couldnt give them anything because I had nothing to give - I had nowhere to get money or food from. We had a bit of porridge, I thought that was better than nothing. Its not the first time - its three out of four weeks a month that I am trying to get through the day and find ways to make money, just to feed them. She said the desperation of her situation has made her consider taking her own le. She said: Sometimes it gets to the point where I wonderits all worth it, Im not going to get anywhere, its just the same thing week in, week out - its just a nightmare. Sometimes I just wish I wouldnt wake up of a morning, thats how bad it has got. And I feel sorry for the kids, its not their fault and I feel really guilty because I cant give them the things that they need.  When it comes to Universal Credit, Debbie says the problems started right away. She explained: First of all they sprung it all on us without any warning - we went from our weekly pay straight into monthly pay. But she says the main issue is that the amount being paid out to struggling families is not enough to get through the month. She said: Weve got to pay our own rent, council tax, water, TV licence - all these things come out of the money that you have to manage. Then there is schools, shopping, food for the kids and all that - we are not getting the right amount. They are expecting us to live off pound for a month.  Speaking about the impact it is having on her children, she admitted: It breaks my heart. My little girl sings songs on her tablet and sends them to me - she says I know you can fight this mummy. Its bad, my kids know Im suffering and Im trying my best - but I feel like I need to do something because I cant cope with it. Debbie said she believes some people think of benefit claimants as lazy or stupid or scroungers, adding: Why would I want to be like this  I want to go out to work, I want to be me again. Ive always worked. Everyday Ive got nothing to live for or look forward to. I havent got enough money to do anything - I want to be better, but I need help. On the issue of Universal Credit, a spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said: Universal Credit simplies an out-of-date, complex system with evidence showing that under UC claimants are getting into work faster and staying in work longer. Our research shows that many people join Universal Credit with pre-existing arrears, but the proportion of people with arrears falls by a third after four months in UC.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13548879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166431538.jpg","title":"beith juniors president says club","story":"NewsBeith Juniors president says club are ready for Scottish Cup day with Ayr UnitedThe Mighty president, John Boal, says Ayrs large travelling support will be given a warm welcome at Bellsdale Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsBeith president John Boal\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at Beith Juniors today insisted they are ready and able to host Ayr United in the Scottish Cup.

Lieutenant Walter Tull, was Britain’s second black professional footballer who had signed up with Rangers, and trained as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Walter- along with millions of other soldiers- will be honoured on Sunday, November  in a nationwide gesture of remembrance. A large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in. And the public will be asked to join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict. The project is the latest collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the World War  centenary, and will use  beaches all around the UK as their canvasses for the mass art-work. Each of the beaches taking part in the project will commemorate a dferent WW casualty.  Walter Tull was born to Alice Elizabeth Palmer, from Kent, and Daniel Tull from Barbados, the son of a slave, on April , . After the death of his parents he and his brother Edward were placed in a children’s home in Bethnal Green. Edward was later adopted and it is believed that he went on to be Britain’s first black dentist after taking over his father’s practice on St Vincent Street in Glasgow. Walter, however, began playing football with Tottenham Hotspur in , and after touring South America with them he was offered a contract, making him the second black professional footballer in Britain. When playing for Tottenham and later Northampton Town he faced a lot of racial abuse and prejudice, yet he went on to have a successful football career. In , Northampton Town began negotiations to transfer Tull to Glasgow Rangers. However, the First World War broke out before Tull could play a game for Rangers. He enlisted as a private in the Footballers’ Battalion of the British Army, where he was quickly promoted to be a sergeant. He took part in and survived the Battle of the Somme, after which he was sent to England to recover from illness. He then went to train as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Although black officers were not allowed in the British Army at this time, he was commissioned in May , thus becoming the first black combat officer in the British Army. He died in battle in France in , during the last major German offensive. His body was never found. Walter will be remembered this Sunday as the public pay their respects to millions of fallen servicemen. • Activities on Ayr beach will happen between .am and am.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnBritish ArmyArmed forcesAdoptionWorld War Ayr United FCAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"detectives step up hunt armed","story":"NewsDetectives step up for their hunt for armed thugs who attacked and attempted to rob women in her homeShareByGary Fanning:,  NOV NewsPolice are now appealing for information after the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDetectives today have stepped up their hunt for two armed thugs who attacked a terried woman and tried rob her in her Ayr home.

The incident along with other concerns has sparked a proposed shake-up of taxi and private hire rules. The middle seat in the front could be ditched from fleets of larger vehicles following a public consultation. The public are going to be askedpeople should still be allowed to sit in the front of vehicles. The consultation will also questionthe number of passengers sitting up front should be reduced to one. South Ayrshire Council’s Leadership Panel heard last week how the middle passenger was seated too close to drivers. A report presented to councillors said the close proximity left drivers open to accusations of “inappropriate conduct. Explaining one incident reported to the council,licensing team leader Morag Douglas said: “There were concerns that a driver was threatened by young girls who booked a private hire. “They left without paying and stated thatthe driver took any action the driver would be reported to the police for inappropriate conduct.” She said the council received other gripes from drivers about what a tight squeeze it is with two passengers in the front. Ms Douglas told how drivers said having “two larger people in the front seats” meant it is dficult to control the car without touching middle seat passengers. All eight seater vehicles licensed by the council have two passenger seats in the front and six in the back. Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “It is as much about protecting the drivers as the passengers.” He added: “We need to be cautious and make sure that whatever we come up with doesn’t have unintended consequences.” Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils don’t permit passengers in the front seats of taxis. Feedback from South Ayrshire Taxi and Private Hire Operators’ Forum members suggested the inidual drivers should decidethey want passengers up front. The members also told the council there should still be an option to have two passengers seated in the front. There are  licensed taxis and  private hire vehicles in South Ayrshire. The specicationsapproved would only apply to newly licenced vehicles.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGlasgowAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13556455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS69111168.jpg","title":"tributes paid ayr united legend","story":"NewsTributes paid to Ayr United legend Johnny Graham, who dies aged The Somerset Park legend died last week, aged , and tributes have been led by former teammate Jim McSherry.ShareByMike Wilson:,  NOV NewsJohnny Graham at a packed Somerset Park\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWarm tributes are being paid to Johnny Graham, the skipper who led Ayr United into the first ever Premier League.

Resident Mark Inglis called for the entrance into the entire precinct to be shted to Portland Street.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus. It should not just parallel other bus routes, which is what the Tesco bus does, but should serve some of the residential areas that are cut off from buses. Goose Green is another area remote from a bus route.A Tesco spokesperson said: ldquoWe have made the dficult decision to stop the provision of the T and T bus services to and from our Musselburgh Extra store.ldquoUnfortunately the services make a loss, which means we are no longer able to provide them.ldquoWe have worked with local bus providers to ensure that all affected areas will continue to have a bus link that connects them to our store, including a newly introduced  bus from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird.ldquoOur priority now is to ensure our customers who use the bus are aware of our decision and of all these alternative routes so that they are able to plan their journeys.ldquoWe apologise for any inconvenience this causes.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoEast Lothian Council was notied of Tescorsquos intention to withdraw the T and T services in September and we are fully aware of the impact this may have on the local community. We actively engaged with local providers and Prentice coaches are implementing changes to the  service, which will start on October  from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via the Tesco turning area and will now mirror the times of the T T to allow connection from other services.ldquoOperators looked at the T  service the general conclusion was that a straight like-for-like service was not commercially viable due to the numbers using the service.ldquoThe council is not licensed to operate the running of service work and our own fleet is at full capacity however, we will continue to discuss options, which will include community buses as a way to support residents who are affected.Ross Prentice, managing director of Prentice Coaches Ltd, said: ldquoWe are starting a new bus service, the , on Monday.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

The location has been selected as it forms the primary gateway into the town and is visible from the railway line, said the applicants.Ken Ross, from applicant Hallhill Development Ltd, said: ldquoWe are delighted that the Scottish Government has approved this fantastic piece of public art and are actively engaged with Andy to get the bear erected in Dunbar in spring .ldquoThis piece of art will not only contribute to the emerging identity of Dunbarrsquos new gateway but has the potential to draw people into the area to find out more about John Muir.Mr Ross was confident the sculpture would prove popular with children and would become a landmark.The sculpture is made of welded steel and fabricated from steel plates of ious thicknesses, heavy at the bottom and lighter towards the top. Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire. He said: ldquoThe proposal has had a range of dferent opinions within the community.ldquoHowever, any piece of new artwork that is ever produced and put into a location always has dferent opinions from dferent people about whether it is good or not.ldquoThe artist selected to produce this is well-known. He did design the Kelpies, which is now an internationally known piece of artwork.Andy Scott has completed over  projects across the UK and internationally.He was delighted it had been approved and said: ldquoIt is fantastic that we have now been given the green light to create this sculpture in memory of such an influential character as John Muir, especially given todayrsquos environmental climate.ldquoHis role in creating national parks is well known in the United States, but sadly not so well known here and this bear sculpture will provide an opportunity to enlighten people about the man and his work.ldquoIt is a symbol of the wilderness John Muir was such a passionate advocate of and is testament to his incredible desire to protect the natural environment."},{"url":null,"title":"chef-at-seton-sands-rubbed-his-groin-against-teenage-waitress","story":"Paul Salinger, , of Prestonpans, was working as a chef in the kitchen at the county caravan park, near Port Seton, when he deliberately pressed against two girls who had been employed as waiting staff.One victim, who cannot be named due to legal reasons, told Edinburgh Sherf Court that Salinger ldquobrushed against her with his groin when she was collecting meals from the kitchen area.She also said that Salinger would stare at her while she worked shts at the holiday parkrsquos restaurant.The South African national stood trial at Edinburgh Sherf Court last Thursday, where he denied a total of five charges.The father-of-two took to the witness stand himself, where he told the court he had worked in many busy kitchens during his career and it was inevitable that people would brush against each other.He said he started at Seton Sands in February this year but was let go in May following the allegations.Salinger, of Longdykes Road, said he could not remember any specic incidents but added: ldquoIf I had brushed against her I would have had pots, pans and bowls in my hand.The chef said it was most likely the girl had felt a bowl he was carrying that touched against her rear end.He told the court: ldquoI would never have done that ndash I would never have grabbed her bum.ldquoMy body never touched them.

Irsquove no reason to touch anyone in that way.He said he had never been spoken to by park management about any complaints made against him and he was let go without any explanation.Following all the evidence, Sherf John Cook agreed to the defence motion to acquit Salinger on a charge of sexual assault on a woman which was alleged to have taken place at his previous employment at the Cakes  Shakes outlet in Musselburgh.The sherf also acquitted Salinger of a second alleged offence of making inappropriate comments and sexual gestures towards another woman at the same place.But the sherf told Salinger he was ldquosatisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had sexually touched the two teenagers at Seton Sands and said to think otherwise would be ldquofancul.Sherf Cook added that the offences had been ldquodeliberate sexual assaults and not accidental and that the pots and pans excuse was ldquoinherently unlikely.Sherf Cook deferred full sentence on Salinger for the preparation of social work reports and a restriction of liberty order assessment.The sherf also placed Salinger on the sex offendersrsquo register for a period still to be decided.Salinger was found guilty, following a summary trial, of sexually assaulting a teenager by seizing her by the bottom and squeezing it at Seton Sands Holiday Park on an occasion between March  and May .He was also found guilty of pressing his body against a second girl, placing his hands on her waist, and rubbing his groin against her at the same location and between the same dates."},{"url":null,"title":"celebration-of-the-life-of-inspirational-north-berwick-teenager-held","story":"Reon McSherry, , who had battled leukaemia, sadly passed away last Thursday.His family said: ldquoReon was an inspiration to all who knew him and will be forever missed.Reon, of North Berwick, was diagnosed with leukaemia in April  and required a bone marrow transplant.

The Femen group claimed responsibility.Last to arrive was Russian President Vladimir Putin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was positioned in pride of place between President Trump and Mr Macron, a powerful symbol of victors and vanquished now standing together, shoulder to

far away in Europe and, most memorably in the brutal  battle of Gallipoli, in Turkey.In Paris, the jewel that Germany sought to capture in  but which the Allies fought successfully to defend, the

Macronrsquos defence of multi-lateralism will take centre stage.President Trump lives by an ldquoAmerica First credo, and plans to visit the American cemetery at Suresnes on the outskirts of Paris before heading home.On Saturday, he was criticised for cancelling a visit to the Belleau Wood battleground north-east of Paris because of rain.In the four years of fighting, remembered for brutal trench warfare and the first use of gas, France, the British empire, Russia and the United States had the main armies opposing a German-led coalition that also included the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires.Almost  million soldiers died, sometimes tens of thousands on a single day.The United States came late to the war, in April , but over one-and-a-half years it became a key player in the conflict and tipped the scales for the allies.When the war ended, the US armed forces was on the cusp of becoming the major military power in the world.Even though Germany was at the heart of

And right here is where you start paying hellip in sweat.Imagine, then, my excitement when I found out that itrsquos not too late to don a leotard and pair of footless tights ndash legwarmers optional ndash and release my inner ballerina.Adult ballet is a fast growing trend, thanks mostly to the revived interest in dance sparked by the reality TV series Strictly Come Dancing.There are now adult classical ballet classes for Absolute Beginners at Scottish Ballet, where you can learn how to do a plieacute without the pressure of feeling like a failureyou donrsquot make the corps de ballet.Anybody of any age, shape or fitness level can and does take part in these classes. Ballet is great for fitness, boosting cardio, strength and flexibility, co-ordination and balance and is weight-bearing so it helps build muscles and bones. Ballet burns  calories an hour ndash more than a spin class ndash and is fantastic for posture and is also a known stress buster.There are waiting lists to get on the Scottish Ballet -week courses for absolute beginner, beginner and intermediate dancers and I found out why when I signed up for an absolute beginnersrsquo class there.Dance teacher Preston Clare is not quite as strict as Debbie Allenrsquos character Lydia Grant in Fame, but he does insist on correct technique with his students, who range in age from  to late s.ldquoI want everyone to be safe, so I teach them how to bend with their knees over the toes and the proper way to move through the foot against the floor so there arenrsquot any injuries, he says.One of the joys of teaching this class, Preston says, is watching the transformation in his students.ldquoTherersquos one man who is quite heavy. He had such a curved spine and hunched shoulders that when he lay flat on his back, his head couldnrsquot touch the floor. After a few weeks of ballet, he can now lie flat and hersquos lost a lot of weight.One of the reasons ballet is such an effective way to change your body, he explains, is the music ndash classes at Scottish ballet are accompanied by pianist Michael Barnett.ldquoProfessional ballet dancers have the physiques of athletes but dance is an art form, not a sport. The music lts you up ndash it helps you reach that bit further.Preston shows me into the large, bright studio at Scottish Balletrsquos headquarters at the Tramway in Glasgow. I gaze longingly at a pile of colourful tutus stacked outside the class but have to content myself with what Irsquom wearing: gym gear I usually wear to pilates. I notice the other women are in black leotards and tights with flippy little ballet skirts, but at least I have proper soft ballet shoes.Irsquove always been hopeless at learning new steps and Irsquom a little nervous about looking like one of the dancing hippos in Disneyrsquos Fantasia. However, Preston reassures me that everyone starts out the same.ldquoRelax and have fun, he says. ldquoMy students know they are not going to join a ballet company they are here to enjoy themselves. I love teaching adult beginners because they are so dedicated.Alexandra Lesley, an actress in her early s, and her partner, Keith Hooley, , are certainly committed: they travel from Thornhill in Dumfriesshire to attend the class once a week, a round trip of three hours.ldquoI love it. I get such a buzz and come out walking on air, says Alexandra. ldquoBallet keeps me fit and flexible.Keith, a retired quality controller, says: ldquoAlexandra encouraged me to go with her and I really enjoy it. My sciatica cleared up after one class and I donrsquot slouch any more. It also helps to keep my mind sharp ndash ballet doesnrsquot just exercise your muscles, joints and ligaments. At home we practise in the kitchen, using the counter tops as a barre.Josh Polson, , a teacher from Glasgow, has been impressed by how much more flexible and stronger he is playing American football since starting ballet last year. He was inspired to take up ballet after seeing his girlfriend, who is with Scottish Ballet, on stage.ldquoIrsquod never done anything like this before and wanted to see how dficult it was. Now I have even more respect for my girlfriend and how hard she works.Josh, too, finds the benefits arenrsquot just physical.ldquoI have a stressful job teaching children with behavioural dficulties. Ballet is very calming and allows me to switch off because Irsquom focusing so much on the steps.Itrsquos time for me to join the class. We start off with some simple barre exercises and I soon get into the swing of things, despite wobbling when we have to let go the barre and balance on tiptoe on one leg. Preston keeps the atmosphere light with some teasing and jokes and Irsquom soon having fun.ldquoThis is easy-peasy, I think, dreaming of skipping straight to beginners. But it soon gets harder as we move into a Polonaise ndash a skipping, sliding dance invented by Louis IV, to allow men at his court to show off their calves. I soon get mixed up with the steps but manage to keep up. The pirouette is trickier to master as you have to whip your head around as you turn to avoid being dizzy. I end up dizzy ndash and hot and sweaty.Ballet is much harder than I expected and the next day my calf, arm and stomach muscles ache.A beginnersrsquo over-s class, surely, will be easier. But the class at Dance Factory on Glasgowrsquos Southside, is also demanding. After a few simple barre exercises, I end up tripping over two left feet during the dance sequence. I can sort of do the graceful arms, though, and channel Margot Fonteyn. The other women skip about with confidence, landing softly when they jump, their backs straight and arms properly swan-like. They may be in their s and s, but there isnrsquot a middle-aged spread or dowagerrsquos hump to be seen.ldquoBallet is excellent for strengthening your core and improving posture, says dance teacher Olivia McLay. ldquoItrsquos good for menopausal women because it builds bone mass ndash bones begin to thin at that age. It improves physical and mental agility, helps with balance, co-ordination and memory because you have to learn a sequence of steps.ldquoI sleep better, Irsquom stronger and feel more stretched and mindful, says Linda Weir, , from Glasgow. lsquoI just love it and would recommend it as a way to be stronger and fitter. Irsquove also made friends.Alison Lock, , from Glasgow said: ldquoItrsquos a physical and mental workout. Itrsquos much more fun than going to the gym, and it has stopped me feeling isolated.Linda Trainor, , was a talented ballerina as a child who won a scholarship at to the Royal Academy of Dance, but had to leave when her mother died.ldquoI always felt there was a hole in my le and itrsquos been wonderful to go back to ballet, even this late in le. It makes me happy.The many physical and mental benefits are the reason Scottish Ballet has classes for people with dementia, Parkinsonrsquos Disease, and a class for the elderly called Regenerate. Soon there will a class for people with multiple sclerosis.ldquoThere are proven benefits, says Catherine Cassidy, director of engagement at Scottish Ballet, who has seen a growing interest in the adult beginnersrsquo classes since they started three years ago.ldquoBallet improves balance, co-ordination and fluidity of movement. The music and rhythm combined with visualising unfolding your wings like a swan, for example, helps people with neurological conditions to move.ldquoBallet is also relaxing and gives you a sense of achievement as you master new skills. The mental health benefits are huge.Kerry Livingstone, head of the associatesrsquo programme at Scottish Ballet and head of Ballet at the Royal Conservatoire, says: ldquoIn these fast-paced days of social media and constant interruptions from emails and text messages, ballet forces you to concentrate fully and is great for mindfulness. It gives you self-discipline and because itrsquos an art, itrsquos uplting and creative.Undeterred by my clumsiness and encouraged by Preston and Olivia, Irsquove signed up for an Absolute Beginners course at Scottish Ballet ndash and Irsquom absolutely loving it.Ill never be the next Darcy Bussell but Irsquoll hopefully be stronger, more flexible and have the poise and graceful posture of a ballerina.See www.scottishballet and www.dancefactory"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-calendar-captures-the-beauty-of-scotland","story":"Herald calendar captures the beauty of ScotlandAn early morning view of the River Shiel near to Acharacle, on the Ardnamurchan ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtpeninsula.

You can run down to a scene where there are perfect reflections in the water but by the time you get down to the loch, it is full of ripples hellip and it drives it nuts, but that is all part of the fun.His shot of Buachaille Etive Mograver was taken from the frozen river at Kingshouse Hotel, in Glencoe.

I noticed it one day when I went to collect my son. This would have been around .I mentioned it to a friend. She and I were in the same womens group and a friend of hers had died from breast cancer. The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds. Isnt that lovely Another special tree was one I saw at a holiday place we rented at Achnacloich, near Oban.The gardens there have this amazing redwood that looks like a gigantic hand.The reason it looks like a hand was that when it was planted a rabbit kept nibbling the bud in the middle. Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees. All the species are beautul. There is such a range of colourful berries and they are a hardy plant. In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

To find a location, he followed instructions said to have come to him in a dream and loaded panniers of gold on the back of a donkey.William followed the animal as it roamed across his lands. When night fell, it rested under a tree on a higher and rockier site close to the steep-sided Allt Dearg.The castle was built on that spot with the unique quirk that it was constructed around the tree. This subsequently became a feature of part of the cellar, known since as ldquoThe Hawthorn Room.Legend has it that the tree has magical qualities which have on more than one occasion saved the castle from disaster.Modern scientic analysis has revealed that the tree died in approximately , most likely as a result of being deprived of light because the castle had been built around it.

But in , Countess Haig, we of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, suggested that a factory, employing those men disabled by war, should be created to make poppies for Scotland. First based in an old wood-chopping factory in the grounds of Whitefoord House in Edinburgh, it moved in  to an old printing works in the city’s Warriston Road.And after this year’s very special Armistice centenary year, the factory will be on the move again – albeit on a temporary basis.A team of around  ex-servicemen and women who hand-assemble more than five million poppies and , wreaths every year for the Scottish Poppy Appeal will be moving to Redford Barracks for two years to allow for a much-needed refurbishment of the factory.The aim is not to rip out the heart of what is a very special workplace – boasting regimental flags and thank you letters and posters from the thousands of school children who have visited.But some £. million from the Libor Fund – fines imposed on banks for manipulation of Libor levels – will ensure the factory is fit for the st Century.Overseeing the move immediately after this year’s Remembrance Day will be factory manager Charlie Pelling, who has been at the helm since .During a tour of the factory, Charlie explained more about the move.He said: “We’ll be moving on November  with the aim of being operational by the start of January.“The aim is to be back at our factory in time for the  or  appeal.“We have a small window of opportunity to make the move as the factory operates year round.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buteman webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Special year...for PoppyScotland with Gordon Michie, its head of fundraising, hoping to raise an additional #, from the  Poppy Pledge campaign. \"  \"  Armistice : PoppyScotland’s  Poppy Pledge campaign viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"“We are like a toy shop in that we work  months of the year with sales throughout that period but our sales climax in the run-up to Remembrance Day in the way a toy shop does at Christmas.“We’ve got to strip out asbestos from the factory, update the heating and wiring, modernise the windows and install a lt to the first floor.“We have to make the factory health and safety compliant and fit for purpose for the st Century.”Charlie is also hopeful that they will be able to create a learning facility.He said: “Thousands of visitors tour the factory every year – from pensioners to pre-schoolers.“Around  school children visit the factory each year, with the same number of adults too.“We want to create an educational facility where they learn about the factory before touring the site.”The workers who power the factory will, however, remain at its beating heart and will be involved in the refurbishment and move.“We have records for more than  servicemen and women who have worked here,” said Charlie. “Since , we’ve had in excess of  workers.“The factory exists to provide employment for ex service personnel who may otherwise struggle to find employment.“They work year round to ensure that enough poppies are created for the Poppy Appeal and for the many wreaths laid at ceremonies across the country.“The move to Redford Barracks will undoubtedly be challenging.“But we’ve got a plan and some very good people here so we’re confident we’ll do it and still be able to create all the poppies for .“The fact we don’t have a modern production line is something we cherish.

We’ve not got a lot of space but we try to display as many as we can.“Instilling a sense of pride in the poppy in future generations is one of the things I love most about working here.”David and his colleagues also display personal mementoes, some of which serve to remind them of just how much their work means.Thomas McPhillipswas a Royal Corps of Signals radio operator in the s.His grandfather, William Anthony, a Lance Corporal with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, died at Passchendaele on July , .And a picture of his cousin’s son, Gary O’Donnell from South Queensferry, now also takes pride of place on his desk.He explained: “Gary was killed trying to defuse a Taliban bomb in Afghanistan in September  he was only .“In  he was awarded the George Medal for bravery demonstrated in Iraq. “He was awarded another George Medal postumously in March .

commemorating  years since Armistice, the Lady Haig Poppy Factory in Edinburgh created a special centenary poppy for PoppyScotlands annual fundraising campaign.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Sunday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Sunday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmRemembrance Day services have been taking place at war memorials throughout Orkney today, the centenary of the Armistice that ended World War One.

The project is supported by Orkney Islands Council’s Arts Development team.It will run on a loop eight times from pm each evening between now and Remembrance Day on November .At around .pm each night it will come to a rest on the final image — a tree, made up of the names of Orcadians who died in WWI, in a field of poppies.Glasgow-based specialists Playdead were engaged to create the film and pupils from Glaitness Primary and Kirkwall Grammar schools were involved in the creation of the work.Kevin McCrae, creative director and founder of Playdead, said: “After speaking to local people and school children about what they’d like to see and seeing what we could draw on from archives as well, we thought it would be good to develop a series of sequences which looked at the war and its impacts in Orkney from a range of angles.“Spectators will see snippets of what soldiers would have experienced, but also there are scenes which explore how farmers and school children would have been affected, as well as a look at what propaganda people here would have seen, and images from after the war of how the end of the conflict was celebrated and how it was commemorated.“There are some big technical challenges associated with projecting onto a surface like the St Magnus Cathedral. It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented. Regular eye tests are important for everyone, but especially for people living with diabetes who should also ensure they attend appointments for specialist diabetic eye screening. It’s a few minutes that could save your sight.’ https:www.diabetes.org.uk resources-s - diabetes_in_the_uk_.pdf https:www.diabetes.org.uk about_us news over--of-people-unaware-diabetes-can-lead-to-blindness- State of the Nation’s Eye Health, Specsavers  RNIB  https:www.rnib.org.uk knowledge-and-research-hub-research-reports prevention-sight-loss stateofthenation http:www.rnib.org.uk sites default files RNIB_evidence_based_review_of_working_age_people.pdf vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But budget leader councillor Alister Mackinnon said uncertainty would remain until the Scottish Government budget in mid-December.Cllr Mackinnon said: \"The exact gap is very uncertain as although the UK governmentrsquos budget has been announced, we will not have the Scottish Governmentrsquos budget and grant settlement figures until mid-December. We are hopeful however that the Scottish Government will pass on the additional money.\"Over the period   to   the Highland Council has already had to implement budget savings of pound. million and council tax rises of % in each of the last two years in order to deliver a balanced budget. We have managed to do this without compulsory redundancies and at the same time have still invested in important projects across the Highlands ndash such as new schools, roads and free wi-fi.\"A major concern is the councilrsquos financial reserves which are at their \"lowest levels in recent history\" requiring immediate action.\"We were estimating a pound million overspend in quarter one ndash but our officers have been working extremely hard to reduce this and we are now predicting a more positive out-turn with an overspend of pound. million,\" Cllr Mackinnon said. \"This is not ideal, but moving in the right direction. We do however have the risk of the cost of another harsh winter ahead of us.\"The council is now focusing on income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies to protect essential services.Cllr Mackinnon added: \"There will be very hard decisions to make as we plan for a reduced budget over the next three years and it is vital that we involve the public, our staff and all members in the choices we make.\"Depute budget leader councillor Matthew Reiss said: \"This is an opportunity to listen to what is important to people, to reshape our priorities and to focus our resources on improving lives.\"I strongly encourage everyone to get involved in this and make your voices heard.

We have a whole plan of engagement throughout the year that will do that, starting later this week.\"And at the same time to listen to the public and to hear the views of what the council is doing really well, what everyone believes the council could be doing better in terms of delivering services and the important part of that is that we go across the Highlands to hear those views.\"The first thing is about listening to people, the second most important thing is about going back and saying to people lsquoyou said and we willrsquo or lsquowe are not able to becausersquo.\"The councilis due tostart a \"public budget engagement process\" tomorrow, designed to help the local authority make decisions to balance its books.\"It is really important that we listen throughout the month of November,\" Mrs Manson said. \"Then we will go back and give feedback on what the suggestions are.\"Mrs Manson was upbeat about the local authorityrsquos financial woes that have seen it stumble from one unpopular cutback to another over several months amid a flurry of resignation threats from within the administration.\"I am quite positive about our budget situation here in the Highlands ndash I think we are in a fair place,\" she said. \"There are places where we will be able to make efficiencies and our officer team and our members are working on that all the time, day-in, day-out behind the scenes.\"However, Mrs Manson did accept that \"there are some challenging areas in there, such as what our priorities for resource and for spend are, and I think it is very important to take a transparent approach so that when we do take decisions in February [when the council budget is decided] we can actually evidence it comes after listening to people.\"One of the answers to those challenges, according to the chief executive, is to rely on the \"many talented staff who believe in the values of public service and that we are here to make a dference\" and to capitalise on an upsurge in community involvement.\"I genuinely believe that many, many people that I have been speaking to over the last few months in dferent parts of the Highlands have really good ideas,\" she said. \"They see where the council can become more efficient.\"But equally so, I think that people can be more understanding of the challenges that we face.\"The local authority has made pound. million of savings since  and raised council tax by three per cent in each of the last two years.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \"We have to do more with less money and our costs are rising for things like fuel, pay and cost of living.\"We are working with services to produce comprehensive information on our current spending profiles, to identy where there are opportunities for efficiencies and any commercial opportunities. Our focus will be on directing our resources to those areas which will give us the best outcomes and deliver value for money.\"Depute budget leader Matthew Reiss said: \"It will not be easy to find more savings on top of those we have already made. Income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies become even more vital in this context in order to protect essential services and we do not have the luxury of the signicant reserves we once had to give us any room for manoeuvre.\"It is undoubtedly the case that there will be very hard decisions to make and we will begin a process of engagement to help us make the right decisions and do the best we can.\"Sunday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In a bright apricot top and carefully made up, she’s surrounded by our favourite foodies as she presents another serving of The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice, the spin off from the ratings busting TV show. She couldn’t be more rehabilitated from the days of her vilication as the man-hating, acerbic lesbian stand-up she never actually was, to the favourite aunty now welcomed into the nation’s sitting rooms to serve up their feelgood comfort food TV. “I think I’m seen as a bit more fluffy now,” says the -year-old in her pleasantly dry laconic drawl. “A lot of the press thought when I got married, ‘oh she can’t be a man hating lesbian after all’”, she says, sounding asshe’s scuffing the toes of her Docs on the ground as she drags herself all the way to double home economics. As for the sartorial makeover, Brand is happy to ditch her matching black T-shirt and leggings for pastels on TV because “they make me. No, they don’t, but my thing is to fight bigger battles. I wouldn’t select colour for myself butsomeone  does, I’ll wear it. And they do your make-up too,” she says, sounding pleased, as she loves a bit of lippy, and an aubergine tint in her hair. Because despite the rebranding, Brand has retained her ability to subvert expectations, as well as her feminist or left-wing principles, along with her talent for devastating one-liners. She’s been making us laugh for  years, since Channel ’s late night comedy show Saturday Live in the late s, after she’d already made her name as the heckle-proof deadpan ‘Sea Monster’ on London’s comedy circuit. Her own shows Jo Brand’s Big Splash and Jo Brand Through The Cakehole followed and she became a regular list on Have I Got News For You, QI, Would I Lie To You and Countdown. Moving into writing, she penned and starred in NHS comedy Getting On, for which she won a Bafta to add to her four British Comedy Awards and most recently, social services satire Damned. Her several books include an autobiography and novels, one of which she adapted into this year’s film The More You Ignore Me, starring Sheridan Smith. And there’s her latest book, the amusingly useful le guide, Born Lippy: How to Do Female. All of which amounts to the sort of career that leads to you being called ‘national treasure’, so how does she feel about that  “It’s not my favourite thing because it limits your behaviour. I don’t hate it, it’s quite funny, but I would reserve judgement because I don’t want to behave like a national treasure for the rest of my le. I might want to do things that don’t fit into that category…”Such as… back in the Extra Slice studio it’s dessert week and Jo is revisiting the contestant’s chocolate spheres. The trick is to pour hot chocolate sauce over and watch it melt daintily, but an impatient Brand speeds things along with a tenderising mallet, inadvertently also smashing the white china plate underneath. “Sorry,” she says, unconvincingly, as the guests and studio audience cheer her on. This national treasure still has an irreverent bite.Brand loves presenting Bake Off: An Extra Slice despite admitting thatwe shouted ‘Show Us Your Bakes!’ at her, she’d come up with... “not much – a very plain sponge or a rhubarb crumble. The problem I have is making it look nice and Bake Off is as much about art as baking.” Did she take the hosting gig for the comic potential of soggy bottoms, cracks and buns then “To be honest, I did it because they asked me, and I love its happy audience, funny  and – unintentionally terrying sometimes – audience baking. And I liked the format. It’s a bit like Have I Got News For You, presenting, with a  of funny people and an audience.“I’m doing another HIGNFY soon, hosting this time, and it’s like promotion, being a grown up,” she says.The  show allowed Brand to demonstrate her more reasonable than raging approach to feminism when she calmly reprimanded a dismissive Ian Hislop and the all-male  for downplaying sexual harassment in the House of Commons, by saying, “For women,you’re constantly being harassed, that builds up and wears you down.”“I really like Ian a lot and have known him for years and I was really surprised, but I felt I had to say something. Because it’s a creeping thing, a collective set of experiences that wear you down. It’s not a one off touching your bum, or ‘you look gorgeous’, it builds up.” As the mother of teenage daughters, Maisie and Eliza, Brand is used to being uncool, but for once they were impressed. “They loved it because I was trending on Twitter for three months. And I’m pleased it got the attention it did. My instinct was to speak quietly because it’s such a cliché about feminists, that they’re just a load of shouty women with no sense of humour.” At which point it seems apposite to insert one of the jokes from Born Lippy: How many Feminists Does it Take to Change a Lightbulb Do it yourself, you lazy bastard.Things have changed for women in comedy too, for the better according to Brand as attitudes have moved on. “For a long time male comedy was described as being lots of dferent styles – Eddie Izzard did surreal, others did puns – and women were just ‘women doing comedy’, but these days women are allowed to have all kinds of dferent personalities and styles.” Away from the telly, Brand is back on stage and heading for Edinburgh, with Birmingham Repertory Theatre’s Nativity! The Musical. Thanks to Maisie and Eliza, she has been to her share of nativity plays and is a big fan of the Nativity! films. “What you do is totally focus on what your child is playing, eventhey’re a rock or sheep, and for my money, the more mistakes the better.“I’m playing a newspaper critic who starts off cynical and is swept away with the show because the kids are so great.” Being self-deprecating, Brand is downplaying her own starring role in a school nativity, when she played not ‘Bethlehem’, as she’s claimed, but Mary. “Well, I remember virtually nothing about it, apart from wearing a white head thing and a blue dress. It was the s and traditional – no space ships – they didn’t give Mary an awful lot to say. Mary doesn’t say a word in the Bible, it’s all Joseph. And she was very pregnant, wasn’t she, so she’d probably just have said ‘My God I’m tired.’”Born in South London in July  to an engineer and social worker, with an older and younger brother, Josephine Grace Brand grew up in Kent then moved schools at , hated it and started to skive, smoke and drink. In Born Lippy she doesn’t hold back describing her headstrong teen years with stories of the time her dad punched her heroin addict boyfriend, or when he threw all her clothes on a bonfire after he and her mother caught underage Brand coming out of Emmanuelle, stoned, accompanying seven men, the incident that prompted her leaving the family home. Moving in with her posh heroin addict boyfriend, she went on the pill and put on four stone, becoming the spiky haired, thick-skinned ‘Sea Monster’, an alternative comedian who faced down the hecklers with her deadpan drawl. Ask Brandshe regrets leaving home as a teenager, she demurs.“No… I would say I probably did the right thing actually because I don’t think things would have been any better at home and to some extent, my leaving added to the weight that made my father get some help. I needed to get out just because we were in one of those awful relationships where you can’t work it out and be calm.” While honing her comedy she trained as a psychiatric nurse and worked at an emergency department where knives, guns and abuse were a reality and made the clubs look tame. “When you’re a stand-up comedian and people are off their heads, you get a lot of abuse. But the manic phase of bipolar disorder is way more eloquent than the average drunk bellowing ‘f*** off you fat cow’”. Brand’s ten years working as a psychiatric nurse provided her with background for her sitcoms satirising le at the sharp end of the caring professions and she acknowledges that her father’s struggle with depression may have influenced her original choice of career.Set in a geriatric ward the BBC Four series Getting On, which she co-wrote and co-starred in three series of, was directed by Peter Capaldi and did for the NHS what The Thick Of It did for politics, as well as winning her a Bafta in  for Best TV Comedy Performance. Meanwhile Damned, the second series of which screened this year on Channel  is set in a social services office, and stars Brand, and her friends Alan Davies and co-writer Morwenna Banks.“They say write about what you know then you don’t have to spend a lot of time researching to make it relevant. That’s why I haven’t done any dramas about scaffolding. I stick to stuff I do know about, mental health, nursing, social work, and not many people are doing stuff about that. I have experienced a lot of le. My favourite comedy is the kind where you see that, where people have had proper jobs before they came into it. It adds something.” Mental illnessis also dealt with in The More You Ignore Me, a novel she turned into a film, set in s rural England. Starring Sheridan Smith as Gina, a schizophrenic mum who is hospitalised after becoming obsessed with a local weatherman, it also features Mark Addy, Sheila Hancock, Ricky Tomlinson and Brand herself.“The central thing is how unglamorous it is to be ill like that, and its impact on the family. In the s it was something that was kept private, shameful. My dad suffered depression from his teenage years and didn’t seek help until his mid-fties. It’s unrecognisable now in comparison, and the power of the person seeking help has risen exponentially. “A few of my friends who are psychiatric nurses saw it and they’re hard-bitten cynical people, so to make them cry and laugh too, I was satisfied. I couldn’t believe I had the power to move people with something I’d written.” Her latest book Born Lippy: How to Do Female is moving too, as well as funny, and most of all useful. A collection of all the things Brand wishes she’d known, things she’s learnt, and things she hopes for the future, among the chapters are, How to Manage a Bully, Your Family And How To Survive It, Having Fun, Not Having Fun, How Not to Fall in Love, Feminism, a Rebranding and Staying Sane.There’s also handy practical advice for you to try. Can’t get on with your toxic family  Lower your expectations. People making you unhappy  Ultimately, you can walk away. Nervous at parties  Try some ice-breakers: “What’s the most violent incident you’ve ever witnessed ” Or “What’s the worst lie you’ve ever told ” Find yourself confronted with a flasher  Shout “That looks like a penis only smaller,” and for women faced with that old favourite: “You obviously hate men,” try “No I don’t, it’s just you”, while “You need a good shag”, can be dispensed with “I’ll look where then.”Hitchhiking alone at night, falling in love with a heroin addict or smashing up an abusive driver’s windscreen when you have PMT  Read Brand’s own experience and it might put you off. Although she’s conflicted about that last one. “I’m not advocating violence,” she says, “butyou do suffer from PMT be aware you might go there one day. I used to control it  per cent of the time, and when I didn’t, I tried to appreciate it. And it was always towards things, never people, and that’s not quite so bad.“The book is all stuff that was familiar to me, that happened to me or was interesting to me. Hence the lack of a chapter on motor mechanics. I wrote it for my daughters in a way.“If you’re a comedian rule number one is ‘be funny’. There are serious bits but a lot of it is tongue in cheek. I don’t like to give advice and I think the best way is to tell people stories about what went wrong for you and say,you can avoid doing that you’ll be better off.” Brand is keen to write more novels – “so I don’t have to get dressed” – but hasn’t lost her love of stand-up. The problem is being away too much from the South London home she shares with husband of  years, Bernie Bourke, a psychiatric nurse, her daughters and cats Louis and Dotty. Script-writing and TV work suit her at the moment, but she’s never been one for five or ten year plans. “As things come up I think do I want to do it or not ” she says.And she decided she did want to do the Edinburgh and London legs of the Nativity! The Musical tour as she “likes Scotland”. Speaking of which, Brand was one of the  celebrities who signed an open letter in theto the people of Scotland urging them to stay in the UK in . Does she still think that, in the light of the Brexit vote “Well, I think so, just because I like Scotland,” she says. “But to be honest, I don’t blame you for wanting to leave because I wouldI was in Scotland. You have policies that are good on health, such as free care for the elderly, and it’s more caring. “As for Brexit, I would support another referendum because I think we are much better suited being in Europe than on our own, but it looks asaround half of the people are delighted by Brexit, and that’s quite a dficult thing to live with. “A bit of me thinks ‘you’ve made your bed, see what happens when you haven’t got enough people for the health service, doctors, teachers…’ Let’s see what happens. I think we are in the last chance saloon andwe do leave, I’m not sure how it’s going to be,” she says, sounding resigned. Butanyone should be tempted to say to her, “Cheer up love, it may never happen!” I refer you to one of her handy general purpose put-downs, “Keep talking and it will.”@JanetChristieJo Brand will appear in Nativity!

Though Jo Johnson was careful not to take too many potshots at Boris, his resignation last week as a minister and demand for a second EU referendum could scarcely have been a more powerful indictment of the former Foreign Secretary#s reckless egotism or a clearer attempt to separate himself from his elder sibling.In this, he was successful: his explanation for his actions, set out in a y blog post, possessed an integrity Boris wouldn’t recogniseit ran up to him in the street yelling: “This is the way you behaveyou have an ounce of decency, you craven, self-entitled buffoon.” The gulf between the two was reinforced when another Johnson – their sister Rachel – tweeted: “Am hugely proud of my honourable and principled brother, Jo, who has put the interests of the country ahead of his political career.” The “as opposed to my unprincipled brother, Boris, who shafted the country, then legged it” addendum was tacit, but everyone understood it, nonetheless. Jo’s blog post is a clear-eyed,devastating analysis of the scale of the crisis facing the UK as a result of Brexit and of the failure of “statecraft” that brought us to this position. In it, the former transport minister says the “choice” being presented to the British people – between Theresa May’s fudgeand a “no deal” Brexit – is a choice between “vassalage and chaos”.Despite being a Remainer, Jo says he had hoped the government would make a success of Brexit, delivering the vision of a post-EU Britain voters were promised before the referendum. Now, however, he understands that the notion of a great nation freed from the shackles of Brussels was a mass delusion, and believes the country must be given another chance to vote on the reality.“To those who say that is an affront to democracy given the  result, I ask this: ‘Is it more democratic to rely on a three-year-old vote based on what an idealised Brexit might offer, or to have a vote based on what we know it does actually entail ” he wrote.Of course everything is relative. Before we get carried away by Jo Johnson’s clarity, let us remember that this is the man who lost his job as universities minister for appointing Toby Young – purveyor of misogynistic and homophobic tweets – to the board of a universities regulator.Equally, the younger Johnson may have seen the light, but his epiphany is somewhat belated. Though others have been measuring the depth of the abyss at the edge of which we are hovering ever since the Leave campaign was victorious, it has taken the approaching Commons voteto focus his mind.Nevertheless, set beside Boris, Jo is a model of decorum. He stuck by the Prime Minister while she tried to deliver a Brexit neither of them wanted. And – at the point when sticking by her was no longer compatible with his conscience – he exited with dignity, eschewing the opportunity to make her the scapegoat for other people’s failings.Compare his behaviour to that of his Big Bro, who hawked the country’s future for a shot at power, and, when it all went wrong, blamed everyone but himself. Boris is no keener on Theresa May’s plan than Jo, yet he would rather see the country plunged into darkness than offer the electorate the opportunity to record that they were sold a pup by a bunch of blaggers. It is dficult to believe they share the same gene pool.Jo shines because he is surrounded by intellectual pygmies: people like Dominic Raab, who makes David “no notes” Davis look competent. You might have thought Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley had hit peak idiocy when she admitted she hadn’t known people in the Six Counties vote along constitutional lines. But Raab apparently has problems grasping the concept that Britain is an island. Last week, he revealed that, until recently, he did not fully appreciate the importance of the Dover-Calais crossing for UK trade. This is odd. After all, in June – a month before he replaced Davis as Brexit Secretary – it emerged the civil service had drawn up a Doomsday scenario of the pandemonium that would unfold in the event of no-deal Brexit. It included the prediction that the port of Dover would collapse on day one, that supermarkets in Scotland and Cornwall would run out of food within a couple of days and that hospitals would run out of vital supplies within a month.But then you only have to watch footage of Raab failing to understand the basics at the first meeting of the Exiting The EU select committee back in  to get a sense of his cerebral limitations. Then, Raab declared himself “jarred and bemused” by the idea that Brexit might create more rather than less bureaucracy. Sir Simon Fraser, former director-general, Europe and Globalisation, can be seen explaining it all to him with admirableslightly strained patience. Like a teacher dealing with an academically challenged pupil, he finds concrete examples to make his points more digestible. Let’s look at what might happenwe were to leave the customs union, he says. One corollary of that might be that there would need to be new regulatory arrangements put in place and checks on goods crossing the border. This could potentially create a heavier bureaucratic burden. It’s no use, though despite his best efforts Raab remains “bemused”.With this inability to take in information, it’s no wonder we are where we are. The country is being led by politicians who struggle with the simplest political concepts. How could they ever have been relied upon to steer their way through the trickiest negotiations of our time Referenda used to be sneered at ordinary people could not be expected to understand the ins and outs of complicated decisions. That’s what politicians were for. We voted them in because we trusted them to act responsibly on our behalf. But that requires them to be insightful, hard-working and with the best interests of the country at heart. No-one in the current cabinet is of this calibre.On the th anniversary of the First World War Armistice, it seems fair to say: we may not be a nation of lions, but we are most assuredly being led by donkeys. And duplicitous donkeys at that.Jo Johnson is right. Those donkeys – including Boris – sold us: “a  prospectus, a fantasy set of promises that have been shown up for what they were.” There is only one way to deal with this con trick democratically and it is to give voters a second chance to have their say on the cold, hard truth.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4827362.1541792842!/image/image.jpg","title":"upkilting isn t a laughing matter jane bradley","story":"Kiltmaker Howie Nicholsby reveals to Jane Bradley that he#s had a number of unpleasant encounters over the years, after relunctantly agreeing to allow a French model to apparently peek under his kilt during a PR stunt for the Mango clothing retailer.Would you look under a man’s kilt without permission  While you, personally, may not, there are plenty who would. Indeed, it has long been a risk for kilt wearers that they can be subject to unsolicited peeking, questioning about what is worn underneath – or even groping.Yet, while campaigners have long fought, quite rightly, for “up-skirting” to be banned, it has somehow been perfectly acceptable – nay welcome, even – for a woman to feel free to do whatever she likes when a man is wearing a kilt.Earlier this week, I reported on a stooshie over an advert produced by clothing retailer Mango. In it, the model, Jeanne Dumas, apparently a Parisian ‘it girl’, embarks on a visit to Scotland wearing the brand’s garments. As well as a lot of scampering around in the Scottish countryside with a dog, she graces the streets of Edinburgh with her presence, only pausing on her whirlwind fashionista tour to peek cheekily up the kilt of a Scotsman, who happens to be standing handily on the street.Broadcast on social media, the ad sparked outrage among people who complained that this action was “not appropriate”.“Mango,” said one, “are you really condoning lting up stranger’s skirts ! It’s not acceptable, whether it’s a lady’s skirt or a guy’s kilt.”Another argued that it was akin to sexual harrassment. “So odd that in a world where we campaign against ‘upskirting’ andconsider having their skirt lted to be sexual harassment, that a woman looking up a man’s kilt is shown as playful and jokey,” she said.: English upskirting ban ‘will also apply to kilts’As I watched the ad, I realised I recognised the chap who was the victim of this violation. It was none other than legendary Edinburgh kiltmaker Howie Nicholsby, who has worn a kilt every day for the past  years.I tried to contact Howie, who I assumed would laugh off the incident with a tongue-in-cheek comment – after all, he had not looked too traumatised on the video and had presumably given his consent to appear in the ad – but when I finally managed to have a chat with him after he ed from holiday, I found that he did, indeed, feel quite strongly about the practice.In fact, it turned out, he had allowed Ms Dumas to lt his kilt, but under some duress. He told me that he had actually tried to explain to the film crew that he didn’t feel comfortable with her peeking under his kilt, but that the language barrier, combined with a lack of cultural understanding, meant he found it dficult to get across. And after a long day’s filming, Howie was too exhausted to argue.“It was a pleasure to work with the Mango film crew, but they were foreign and they just didn’t get what I was saying about this,” he explains. “I tried to tell them that I wasn’t comfortable with it, that it was the equivalent of up-skirting, but they didn’t understand. It had been a long day and in the end, I just went with it. With hindsight, perhaps I shouldn’t have.”Howie estimates he has experienced at least one incident a year over the past two decades of what I am going to refer to as “up-kilting” with which he has not been happy. “There have been a lot of experiences, often late night in a bar, some in Scotland and some where,” he says. “There have been drunk -year-old women who probably should have known better and on occasion, even some men.”: Leader comment: Scotland’s upskirting law is not fit for purposeOne particularly unpleasant incident occurred in Newcastle, where a group of four women pinned him against the wall in a bar while he was on a stag night as their friend forced her hand up his kilt.“I usually wear underpants, but on that occasion it was a stag do, so I was commando,” he remembers. “I’d used an old rugby trick of putting a fair bit of Vaseline down there to avoid chafing and when the woman grabbed me, she looked at me asI was the one who was disgusting beacuse she’d got a handful of Vaseline. It was asI’d assaulted her, when it was the other way around. I was standing there, thinking ‘Jesus Christ, how is this OK ’”Up-skirting was made a specic offence in Scotland in , which refers to operating equipment, such as a camera, under people’s clothing. A separate up-skirting bill is currently being passed south of the Border, which will, it has been claimed, specically protect kilt-wearers, as well as women in skirts.While groping of any kind is obviously unacceptable and could be classed as an offence under sexual assult laws, socially, a woman sticking her hand up a man’s kilt is often seen as a bit of a laugh. Unlike women in the same situation, men are expected to almost enjoy the experience, which Howie says is most definitely not the case.“Of course, some guys are quite happy when it’s an attractive woman, but it has to be seen as under the same laws which protect women,” says Howie. “It has to be regarded in the same way as up-skirting.”And he’s right. We can’t argue that men shouldn’t look up a woman’s skirt – which obviously they shouldn’t – while watching a major brand do exactly the same in reverse.

Rather than seeing the loss of swathes of supporters during the  independence referendum campaign as evidence it had to do more to connect with voters, the party that once dominated our national politics seemed to take that humiliation as a challenge. Think we can turn off punters, do you  You ain#t seen nothing yet.Last week members of the Scottish Parliament were invited to participate in a vote on support for a second EU referendum, a so-called “People’s Vote”, on the terms of whatever Brexit deal the prime minister is able to negotiate. A majority were in favour. This was unsurprising enough. After all, most MSPs – in line with the majority of Scots – supported the Remain campaign in the  referendum.By  to , MSPs asserted their support for giving the voters the right to accept or reject Brexit in whatever shape it ultimately takes.Keen-eyed followers of the machinations of the Scottish Parliament will have noticed that more than a quarter of Holyrood’s politicians decided not to take a position on this, the dominant political issue of our times. Take a bow, Scottish Labour which – having been asked to take a stand – decided to abstain.With the honourable exceptions of former leader Kezia Dugdale and Edinburgh Southern MSP Daniel Johnson, who both supported a Liberal Democrat call for a People’s Vote, the Labour group at the Scottish Parliament took the weasels’ way out and refused to commit to either position.While Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard struck another blow in favour of political irrelevance, members of the SNP, Greens and Lib Dems united against the Tories to win the day.The Holyrood vote was, we should remember, symbolic the Scottish Parliament has no authority to call a People’s Vote. But symbolism matters in politics. In the aftermath of the  independence referendum, Scottish Labour struggled to make sense of the political environment in which it found itself. Yes, it had been on the winning side of that particular constitutional argument, but victory came at a cost: many one-time Labour supporters who had voted Yes decided that the SNP better represented them. Labour’s uncertainty – its position on a potential second independence referendum seemed to be fluid, shting from downright hostility to equivocal support and back – benefited only the SNP and the Conservatives, whose leader, Ruth Davidson, swtly established herself as the champion of those Scotswho supported the maintenance of the United Kingdom.The temptation is to say that Scottish Labour has learned no lessons from that experience, that it should have swtly positioned itself with the majority of Scots who voted Remain. But while the party should, indeed, have stood with the  per cent who saw through the Leave campaign’s case, its failure to so do is not a sign of political naivety but of its new priorities.Under UK leader Jeremy Corbyn – a career-long Eurosceptic who insists he voted Remain – Labour is determined not to stand in the way of Brexit. The more gullible among Corbyn’s supporters may delude themselves that he offers the best chance of preventing, or at least ameliorating, the worst effects of departure from the European Union, but those people simply aren’t paying close enough attention to their leader’s action. Time and again he has refused to challenge Prime Minister Theresa May on her Brexit plans, instead maintaining the pathetically weak line that it’s time for another general election. Corbyn placed the ball in May’s court, knowing that she would stick a kne in it. Of course she’s not going to call an election, is she So, there it is. What passes for Labour policy on the single biggest issue facing the UK is an impotent demand for the prime minister to commit an act of political self-immolation. This is not the position of a party that takes at all seriously warnings that Brexit will harm the economy, costing jobs in areas which might never fully recover from the impact. On Friday, Tory transport minister Jo Johnson – younger brother of Boris – resigned from May’s government and announced his support for a People’s Vote. Johnson, a Remain voter in , issued a statement in which he said the Brexit deal currently being negotiated with the European Union would be “a terrible mistake”. Johnson argued that Britain was on the brink of its greatest crisis since the Second World War and pointed out – not unreasonably – that what was now on offer was nothing like what was promised by Brexiteers during the campaign of two years ago.This is where we are now: the old Etonian brother of Boris Johnson is a more formidable champion than the leader of the Labour Party for those, already struggling, who’ll be hit hardest by Brexit.Scottish Labour’s Richard Leonard is only the latest in a line of leaders to have faced the accusation from the SNP that his party is little more than a “branch office”, taking orders from the imperial capital.Often the nationalists’ “London Labour” jibe was rather unfair. Various Scottish Labour leaders established their own agendas, distinctive from the UK party’s.But in the case of Leonard’s Scottish Labour, the charge sticks.When Labour MSPs abstained during the vote on whether there should be a second EU referendum, they put loyalty to Corbyn before loyalty to the majority of their voters.Dugdale’s decision to vote in support of another referendum shows how dferent things would have been had she not been hounded out of office by Corbynistas. Scottish Labour would have found itself, for the first time in a long time, standing with the majority.It appears that Leonard’s Scottish Labour exists to assist Jeremy Corbyn in his project to reshape his party rather than to fight on behalf of the weakest in society.If this is not so, how  might we explain Scottish Labour’s shameful cowardice over Brexit ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff.

Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

From Dunbar, Izzy has always had a keen interest in languages and studies French and Gaelic at Glasgow University.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone.

They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past.

While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8695614.1541521803!/image/image.jpg","title":"irish language group funding snub claim rejected by dup","story":"A DUP councillor has rejected claims that unionists #snubbed# a request to fund an Irish language event.Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge submitted a request to Mid and East Antrim Council to fund an event as part of Seachtain na Gaeilge , which takes place each March.Sinn Fein councillor Patrice Hardy claimed unionist councillors had “refused to even countenance” the request, adding: “Seachtain na Gaeilge is a hugely positive, global event which this council should be supporting rather than snubbing. “The Irish language community aren’t seeking special treatment, they are only seeking equality.”Last year, Ms Hardy accused the council of being “anti-Irish to the core”, after a move to have the local authority participate in Irish Language Week was rejected following a vote by members. In a statement yesterday, she added: “Despite all the controversy over the previous refusal to fund Seachtain na Gaeilge or even to engage with the Irish language community to discuss this, it appears that some members of the council have learned nothing.”But DUP Councillor Gregg McKeen said Conradh na Gaelige had been treated “the same as any other group” who had made a funding request, by pointing them towards the council’s grants programme.He told the News Letter: “They will be assessed under the same criteria as everyone . It is not that they are being refused funding, but they need to go through the same process as everyone . We don’t want to set them on a pedestal above other groups.”Earlier this year, an Irish language event hosted by then DUP Mayor of Mid and East Antrim was commended by Irish language groups.Mid and East Antrim prepares to remember the fallenPolice linking town incidents and appeal for witnesses Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8698670.1541697964!/image/image.jpg","title":"local charities urge readers to show support for vital change the future campaign","story":"Will to Give is a group of  Northern Ireland cherished charities who have come together with one aim - to increase awareness of how important gts in wills are to the causes we all care dearly for.November  -  is Will to Give week, and local charities are asking our readers across Northern Ireland to help Change the Future for the charities you care for by leaving a gt in your willWith this in mind, Will to Give is dedicating this weekto encourage readers across the province to think about making their will and perhaps consider leaving a charitable gt to their favourite cause with their Change the Future campaign.A Will to Give spokesperson said: Every day right here in Northern Ireland lives are transformed thanks to the generosity of gts left in Wills by local people.These gts make a huge contribution to our work and typically fund le-changing research projects and services which can impact on thousands of local lives and change the future for many.Your will tells the people you leave behind, about the person you are.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

The desire to produce the right deal can be superseded by the perceived need to produce a deal.This is why all negotiations need measures to prevent this, a check mechanism and preferably multiple ones.With the current UK-EU negotiations, there are two identiable check mechanisms or lines of defence to concluding an unwise agreement - Cabinet and Parliament.Last week, I wrote to the Prime Minister outlining broad concerns about the direction of travel.This could be discerned from shts in public comments, private engagements and what was being briefed in London, Dublin and Brussels. I wrote in the hope of reassurance and with the desire that an acceptable deal for us all was within grasp. Instead, I received confirmation that we were right to be concerned.If what is outlined in the reply is the type of deal the Prime Minister intends to conclude, then the DUP could not support a deal which annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.Indeed, many others in Westminster and throughout the United Kingdom, true to their commitments to respect the referendum, the national interest and to the Union, have contacted me to voice their concern.Equally we cannot be assured that this current proposal will be the final deal. The European Union price for agreement appears to rise daily whether it be our fishing industry or an ever growing list of level playing field commitments.Last December when this backstop appeared we were deeply concerned. This is why we sought and got the paragraph  assurance of a democratic protection against a sea border.In March, the EU made clear its intention to ignore paragraph  and rewrite paragraph . We took no solace from our predictions being correct but we did take solace that it was universally rejected.Neither the passage of time nor the application of pressure has made it any more acceptable now.The new idea of a UK customs arrangement does not appear to be a genuinely UK-wide offer but a GB offer and an NI offer badged as one - Northern Ireland in THE EU customs territory and GB in A customs union.The real intent is not to solve any land border issues in Ireland but to handcuff the UK to the EU, with the EU holding the keys. The United Kingdom would be trapped.The focus on customs arrangements should never blind anyone to a sea border of regulations.We certainly did not forget it and why we raised it repeatedly and consistently.It was something the Prime Minister ruled out after Salzburg: \"…no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree.\"The limited and low level checks that exist at the moment in Belfast and Larne do not compare to what wo uld be the future arrangement.Key industries in Northern Ireland would be subject to rules and standards with no democratic input to them. Rules would be made in Brussels rather than Stormont or Westminster.The regulatory sea border with some caveats in the Prime Ministers letter is still a sea border.This is not haggling about checks but preventing Northern Ireland from being left in the EU with the Northern Ireland Assembly reduced to vassal status or the devolution settlement torn up.Our most important trade flows are to be hampered and regulated by the EU. Despite all of this a Northern Ireland specic backstop still remains.The Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson has rightly warned: \"…Northern Ireland would erge unconsciously from the United Kingdom against the expressed will of its people - it would also feed Scottish nationalist demands that a similar ergent arrangement be made for Scotland.\"The DUP does not stand alone against this proposal. We appreciate the support from MPs across the United Kingdom.We are ready to stand with those in Cabinet and in Parliament to work for a better deal. One which works for the whole United Kingdom. We want the referendum result to be respected and the entire United Kingdom to leave together with a sensible deal.Arlene Foster is leader of the DUP"},{"url":null,"title":"facebook post by catholic man from northern ireland on why he chose to join the british army gets massive reaction","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He was a fantastic Minister to work with whilst we were at the DfE. It’s a sad loss for Gvt, but Brexit is above party politics. https:t.co icoTQDFv— Justine GreeningNovember , Former Cabinet minister Justine Greening, who shares Mr Johnson’s view that a fresh referendum is needed, called on Tories to oppose the PM’s Chequers proposals.She told The Observer: “The parliamentary deadlock has been clear for some time. It’s crucial now for Parliament to vote down this plan, because it is the biggest giveaway of sovereignty in modern times.”The view was echoed by Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Bridgen who told a meeting of the Bruges Group: “If we can’t chuck Chequers then it’s time to chuck the Prime Minister.”Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker and DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson wrote in The Sunday : “If the Government makes the historic mistake of prioritising placating the EU over establishing an independent and whole UK, then, regrettably, we must vote against the deal.”Brexiteers have insisted that the UK should not get involved with a potentially permanent backstop customs union agreement with the EU as the price of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"ministers at odds over brexit backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

totally unilateral exit, or there’s an absolutely fixed, hard end date’, that is… very, very unlikely that is going to be negotiable with the other side.“On the other hand, people here rightly want comfort and they should be able to have comfort and confidence that it isn’t an open-ended thing.”Mrs Leadsom insisted the UK “cannot be held against its will” in a backstop customs arrangement with the EU, and claimed MPs would not support a scenario in which Britain could not decide when to leave.She told BBC Radio Live’s Pienaar’s Politics: “It cannot be a decision that can be overturned by the European Union, it must be capable for the United Kingdom to decide to leave that customs arrangement and it cannot be something the European Union can hold us to.“Frankly, it’s because that would be to then fail to fulfil on the will of the people expressed at the referendum and I very much doubt we’d get it through Parliament.”“The UK cannot be held against its will in a customs

House of Commons with a bit of nonsense that makes no sense.“You cannot expect the Labour Party to save you from your own backbenchers who are saying this deal makes no sense – and everybody knows it doesn’t make sense.”The comments came after hardline Tory Brexiteers and the DUP joined forces to warn they are prepared to vote down Mrs May’s EU withdrawal plans.In a stark warning to the PM, Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the -member European Research Groupof Conservative backbenchers, and the DUP’s Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, said they would oppose any agreement which they thought threatened the union and could put a trade border down the Irish Sea.Writing in The Sunday , they said: “We share the Prime Minister’s ambition for an EU free trade agreement, but not at any price, and certainly not at the price of our union.“If the Government makes the historic mistake of prioritising placating the EU over establishing an independent and whole UK, then, regrettably, we must vote against the deal.”With the shock resignation of pro-Europe transport minister Jo Johnson continuing to cause ructions in Tory ranks, Mrs May is running out of time to seal an EU exit agreement.Hope of getting the Cabinet to sign off on Brexit deal proposals this week appeared to be rapidly receding, as it was reported the EU had rejected London’s plans for an independent arbitration clause that could allow the UK to quit a backstop deal on the Northern Ireland border.In the wake of Mr Johnson’s resignation, there have been reports that other ministers are considering quitting over Brexit.Brexiteers have insisted that the UK should not get involved with a potentially permanent backstop customs union agreement with the EU as the price of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic updates closure on m1","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

In doing so, we join with people across these islands and across the continent of Europe, and worldwide. An event of impossible human destruction is now commemorated collectively in a powerful symbol of our shared commitment to peace.On this island, it has not always been so. As Irish Parliamentary Party MP Stephen Gwynn said: \"When the time came to rejoice over the wars ending, was there anything more tragic than the position of men who had gone out by the thousands to confront the greatest military power ever known in history, who had fought the war, and won the war, and now looked at each other with doubtful eyes \"That doubtfulness foreshadowed later times when there was too much forgetfulness, neglect or ambivalence in too many quarters about the place of those men and women in the history of this island.However, in the last decades I believe we have seen this transformed. Approaching the centenaries of the last several years, it was by no means clear that we would navigate them in a way that paid proper respect to the part they had in shaping the history, traditions, identities and lived experience of all the people of this island. It was by no means inevitable that we would mark these moments in a way that brought us closer together and gave us a better understanding of one another.Now we can look back and remember together the quiet dignity and shared purpose that characterised the high ceremonies of state of the last number of years. We remember President McAleese and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth side by side and bowing their heads in respect in both the Garden of Remembrance and in Islandbridge. We remember President Michael D Higgins laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier in Westminster Abbey during his State visit. We remember the Taoiseach and Prince William together honouring the memories of the th Ulster and th Irish Division under the round tower of the Island of Ireland Peace Park in Messines,  decades after those men fought shoulder to shoulder.Those moments, and the many others like them, were powerful. They opened up new spaces for everyone and inspired us to move into them. Where forgetfulness had built up, they reminded us. Where there was a sense that there was some unseen line that we perhaps should not cross, they swept it away. They left us closer together than we had been.However, they did not do so in isolation and in fact they did not lead the way. They built on the imaginative and patient work of a generation of people - professional and amateur historians, community leaders, church leaders, journalists, campaigners, and others from all parts of this island - who had refused to accept the articial parcelling out of a shared history to dferent groups and traditions, but wanted us to remember the lives and loss of the sons of Ulster, Leinster, Connacht and Munster all. They built on the work of all those who were not only open to new ideas and stories, new partners and audiences, but sought them out.I have been glad and proud that the Reconciliation Fund in my own department has been able in a small way to support dozens of projects in that spirit in Northern Ireland and where.As always, such transformation and such achievements must be built onthey are to be preserved at all. For the island of Ireland, the decade of centenaries of events that shaped our modern history continues. We will again have to rise to the challenge of remembering those events in our shared history in a way that is authentic and honest and rigorous and respectful of others. We have to do it in a way that enhances our understanding of our history, and our understanding of each other.We have to do all this while finding our way through the political challenges of the moment. I am confident we will. What we have done together in the last few years has shown that we can.In the Summer of , Tom Kettle wrote to his family promising, \" I live I mean to spend the rest of my le working for perpetual peace\". Eleven days later he was cut down while leading his men of the th Royal Dublin Fusiliers in what was described as a \"tempest of fire\" in Ginchy in France.We owe it to him and all the youth of his generation to take up that promise.Simon Coveney TD, Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade"},{"url":null,"title":"world leaders gather in paris a century after wwi armistice","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Femen group claimed responsibility.Last to arrive was Russian President Vladimir Putin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was positioned in pride of place between President Trump and Mr Macron, a powerful symbol of victors and vanquished now standing together, shoulder to shoulder. Overhead, fighter jets ripped through the sky, trailing red, white and blue smoke.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Russian President Vladimir Putin arrives to attend the commemoration The geographical spread of the leaders in attendance showed how the “war to end all wars” left few corners of the earth untouched but which, little more than two decades later, was followed so quickly and catastrophically by the even deadlier World War Two.On the other side of the globe, Australia and New Zealand held ceremonies to recall how the war killed and wounded soldiers and civilians in unprecedented numbers and in gruesome new, mechanised ways.Those countries lost tens of thousands of soldiers far away in Europe and, most memorably in the brutal  battle of Gallipoli, in Turkey.In Paris, the jewel that Germany sought to capture in  but which the Allies fought successfully to defend, the armistice commemorations were being followed by the afternoon opening of a peace forum pushed by the host, Mr Macron.President Trump will be the most notable absentee at the forum, where Mr Macron’s defence of multi-lateralism will take centre stage. President Trump lives by an “America First” credo, and plans to visit the American cemetery at Suresnes on the outskirts of Paris before heading home.On Saturday, he was criticised for cancelling a visit to the Belleau Wood battleground north-east of Paris because of rain.In the four years of fighting, remembered for brutal trench warfare and the first use of gas, France, the British empire, Russia and the United States had the main armies opposing a German-led coalition that also included the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. Almost  million soldiers died, sometimes tens of thousands on a single day.The United States came late to the war, in April , but over one-and-a-half years it became a key player in the conflict and tipped the scales for the allies. When the war ended, the US armed forces was on the cusp of becoming the major military power in the world.Even though Germany was at the heart of provoking two world wars over the past century, the nation has become a beacon of European and international cooperation since."},{"url":null,"title":"200 acre site outskirts derry identified preferred location new cemetery","story":"A site has been

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees. For a modest fee, bulk waste can be collected outside peoplersquos homes.ldquoFor the le of me I do not understand why people are prepared to load up their vehicles and drive to secluded, rural areas to get rid of household waste. Why not just drive to one of the three household centres in our district Cllr Curran said local council officials were placing increasing emphasis on promoting the district as a major tourist destination and the last thing they wanted to see was roads littered with waste.He added: ldquoThe message must go out that illegal dumping is unacceptable and that the countryside and indeed town centres must be respected, not used as open air dumps by people who should know better.ldquoWe are fortunate to live in a stunningly beautul area which should not be blighted by the reprehensible actions of a mindless few. Our rural areas in particular must be respected, not used as open air dumping grounds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballycran have it all to do in final  ","story":"BALLYCRANrsquoS hurlers are hoping that history repeats itself at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Sunday when they take on Cushendall in the Ulster Club Hurling Championship final.Itrsquos  years since the McKenna Park side last lted the Four Seasons Cup. That was in Cushendall are the aristocrats of the competition and while Ballycran have lost all three final appearances since their historic win in , the Ruairi Ogs have been crowned undisputed Ulster champions on no less than five occasions.Ballycran booked their place in this yearrsquos showdown after a sizzling display of open hurling, blasted holders and hot favourites Slaughtneil out of the competition.Gary Savagersquos boys were rated as   outsiders against the defending champions, but they left Slaughtneil in tatters with an impressive display.Savage was part of the team that lted the trophy in  and in addition to now managing the side, his two sons, Liam and Phelim, help control matters on the field of play.Both boys are certainly chips off the old block and Phelim, despite still being a minor player this season, is showing his true pedigree by dominating games from the centre half back berth and midfield.He is surrounded by a host of top class hurlers with Michael Hughes Stephen Keith, Scott and Brett Nicholson, Conor Woods, James Coyle and Colm McManus to feed off.Ballycran lost both their Antrim League games against Cushendall by signicant margins, but championship finals are a dferent animal and Gary Savage will have his side in a voracious frame of mind for Sunday. Cushendall are expected to lt the Ulster crown for a record-breaking th time. They have an abundance of experienced players in Carl Carson, Sean Delargy, Neil McManus, Eoghan Campbell, Ryan McCambridge, Donal Naughton and Paddy McGill, but they know they are in for one heck of a scrap on Sunday.If Ballycran can come up with a plan for depriving Carson, McManus, Campbell, Naughton and McGill of the sliothar, then they are in with a shout, but that is easier said than done, given the experience in the Cushendall set-up.One thing that is certain is that Ballycran will give it their all, but some times that is just not enough.Meanwhile, Burrenrsquos bid to recapture their glory days in Ulster is over for another year following their - to - defeat to Scotstown in their provincial SFC quarter-final in Newry on Sunday.Burren trailed - to - at the break, but a stirring second half display saw them give the Monaghan kingpins a run for their money. However, it was Scotstown who had a sting in their tail and they held on for victory.It was a similar story for Bredagh in their Ulster Club IFC quarter-final in Cootehill on Saturday where they were beaten - to - by Cavan champions Mullahoran. Jody Gormleyrsquos charges were desperately unlucky not to progress and were pipped at the post by a goal in the last minute of added time.Elsewhere, Downpatrick beat An Riocht - to - in the ACFL Division  relegation play-off at St Patrickrsquos Park, Newcastle.The Hoops just about held on in dficult playing conditions as An Riocht refused to go go down without a fight.St Johnrsquos got the better of Ballymartin in their ACFL Division  relegation play-off and their - to - win was just reward for a determined display.The only negative thing for St Johnrsquos was the news that manager Benny Corrigan stood down after the game..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch bypass scheme edges closer  ","story":"THE planned Ballynahinch bypass scheme is moving into the contract stage, Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Cathy Mason has confirmed.The partyrsquos Slieve Croob spokesperson has received confirmation from the Department for Infrastructure that work has commenced on drawing up contract documentation for the scheme.She said: ldquoFollowing the decision by the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard to commence work on the Ballynahinch bypass in December , officials from DfI have been working diligently through the ious legal stages to ensure the long awaited bypass scheme can commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed earlier this year.Ms Mason added: ldquoThis has allowed the Department to now move ahead with preparation of the contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity  ","story":"A RECENT fundraising event in aid of Zambian businessman Charles Mwanda has raised pound,.The St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick was the venue in September for a night of musical entertainment organised by Sr Mary Delargy, a missionary sister from the town who has helped dozens of African children out of poverty and into professions over recent years.When Sr Mary worked in Zambia, Charles was her administrative assistant and she says the fundraising concert was not about giving him a hand out, but a hand up to continue with his business and employ a number of local people.The key reason for the September fundraiser was to generate enough money to allow Charles to purchase a generator so he could power his car wash business.Sr Mary worked in Zambia and during this period Charles was her assistant, helping her with the young people she was working with aged between  and .She had helped Charles get his business going through donations but there was a problemwith the power supply which is intermittent. To help keep the business going, he required a generator which is now in place.Sr Mary explained that due to regular power outages, electricity is only available from pm to am, therefore no business can operate during daylight hours.She said the recent concert at the St Patrick Centre raised pound, with an additional pound raised via subsequent donations.ldquoThe generator has been bought and installed and is making real dference to the business, a delighted Sr Mary confirmed this week.ldquoCharles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity of people he will never meet. He now employs five young men and sustains his own family with the proceeds of the business.Sr Mary has thanked everyone who made the recent concert such a success, in particular, the Director and staff at the St Patrickrsquos Centre and the talented Stephen Smyth and his band who provided the the entertainment.Thanks were also extended to Frenchrsquos for providing the delicious supper, Downe Travel, Connollyrsquos and the Knights of St Columbanus for sponsorship.St Mary added: ldquoThank you to all those who attended the .

Keenan quickly tagged on a rsquo with two Morgan frees stretching the lead to four points by the th minute.Ballymartin were far from playing the role of bystanders, but they managed to shoot seven wides against the wind, misses that proved crucial at the finish.With  minutes gone Chris McKay had a stinging shot crash off the crossbar following a stunning passage of play, but Keenan and Morgan ensured St Johnrsquos kept ticking over with points apiece.Ballymartin continued to waste several good scoring opportunities before Michael Higgins picked up his sidersquos first score in added time at the end of the first half as St Johnrsquos went in with a - to - lead.It took the protagonists a while to settle in after the break, but with  minutes gone Cathal Doyle reduced the arrears to four points with a score from play. St Johnrsquos then cruelly lost the services of the influential Eoin Moag to a black card and minutes later he was followed for an early bath by Darren Savage, who received a second yellow and then red.St Johnrsquos backs were now to the wall and Ballymartin made sure they stayed there. However, another Morgan free stretched St Johnrsquos lead to - to - before the real Ballymartin fightback started.Consecutive points from Michael Cunningham, Ryan OrsquoHareand Ross Cunningham left a single point in it and Ballymartin were in the right tack.The Lilywhites pushed and probed for the equalising score, but with the game in added time St Johnrsquos broke free and a surging run from Conor Flanagan ended with him setting up Branf for the match-winning score.Just to rub salt into the wounds, Morgan added a point from play to leave St Johnrsquos with their Division  status intact.St Johnrsquos: D Morgan, C Magorrian, A Morgan, J Addis, D Savage, R Flanagan, M Grant, A McMullan, E Moag, C Brannf , C Morgan , C McKay, M Keenan , J Clarke, C Flanagan.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I am leaving a small gt to the charities I care for in my will.Will to Give member the USPCA added its appreciation of the value of legacy gts with Brendan Mullan, Chief Executive, explaining:ldquoThe USPCA was established in  and since then the activities of the USPCA have evolved to meet the ever-changing needs of animals.By deciding to leave us a gt in your will you are helping us protect all animals across Northern Ireland.Legacies are extremely important to the USPCA and without these the charity would not be able to deliver our vital services to animals. We believe our success in preventing animal cruelty and the relief of suffering is an enduring tribute to those absent friends who shared our values.Will to Give added: Anyone can leave a gt in their will. It really doesnrsquot matter what size ndash small or large, every gt is greatly received.It is very easy to leave a gt in yourwill to charity ndash in fact, hundreds of people do it every year in Northern Ireland.

Located on Pearse Street right beside Trinity College in the heart of Dublin city, it made the perfect location to for the tour, with quirky and fascinating décor and superbly stylish and comfy rooms to retreat to after a day’s exploration.After unpacking, we progressed to the veranda, mixing with guests from all over the island. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly and boded well for dinner in the Courtyard Restaurant, which included ham hock, blackberry sorbet, and a iety of cheeses and enjoyable wines.Of particular note was the delicious freshly baked bread, the creme brulee and the sirloin and the craic was good with a friendly and cosmopolitan mix of guests.After a very comfortable night, the breakfast was also top class, albeit, for once you are recommended not to try everything as one is typically tempted to, leaving room for the gourmet tour ahead.With the advent of cheap air travel in the s, however, came easy access to the cuisine of France and Italy and a real revolution began the strengths of top quality Irish ingredients then began to be married to the Latin flair and creativity,Our guide for the day was likeable foodie historian and former chef Chris Binchy. Starting in the heart of Trinity University campus, he gave a fascinating talk on the evolution of Irish cuisine. Our parents and their parents, he noted, would have enjoyed a pretty nutriotious but plain diet which ied little from week to week. Originally dominated by dairy produce, as Irish society was organised around cattle, the arrival of the French Normans in the th century brought a dferent type of agriculture and cultivation of crops.Dairy products, oats, fruit and root vegetables, cabbage, bacon, eggs and chicken were later added to with scones, tarts and pastries.With the advent of cheap air travel in the s, however, came easy access to the cuisine of France and Italy and a real revolution began the strengths of top quality Irish ingredients then began to be married to the Latin flair and creativity, giving what is today the st century foodie haunts across the city. Consequently, our first stop was a dedicated cheese shop, Sheridans, where we were entertained and informed by a true French man, who took care to extol the virtues of a wide range of new Irish cheeses made in the French style, all of which were passed around with crackers to sample.Next up was Powerscourt Shopping Centre, what was traditionally a wide open quadrangle in the centre of classic four storey Georgian buildings, but has been transformed into a charming indoor shopping complex, the central feature of which is the glass roof.A centre of all things ‘design’, we were treated to scones and cream from the Pepper Pot, which has a pedigree in custom baked breads and bagels, with a cult following among locals. They serve six dferent breads, all baked daily, which form the centre of all their dishes. Who knew Irish cream is dferent to English cream - clotted and not whipped with no sugar it is delicious enough without anything added, we were informed.

Specialising in natural cheeses, which were delicious, we also sampled a range of delicate parma-style hams, some of which were produced at Ballycastle and have a revered following in Dublin on account of the quality produce. For a change of pace we then popped into a traditional Victorian pub, the Swann, however this was a pub with a dference. It is ‘the’ rugby pub of Dublin, traditionally favoured by touring players the night before games - in the amateur era at least. It was run by legendary Ireland and Lions prop, Sean Lynch. Now run by his son Ronan, Sean still pulls the odd pint behind the bar and the rugby memorabilia on the walls is worth studying.This was followed by a trip to George’s street arcade, filled with ‘boho’ stalls and second hand bookshops, where we stopped at Lolly and Cooks for ‘Savage Rolls’ in Dublin the word ‘savage’ means ‘great’ and boy did these sausage rolls deserve the label. As big as your fist, they were as delicious as the meat loaf my mother used to make. Our last stop was the Temple Bar food market, which is even a hidden gem even to many Dubliners. As you enter, you may hear passionate yells from the acting school a few floors up, while a kaleidoscope of smells invade your senses.First up we tried the fresh oysters and the Temple Oyster Bar - surprisingly delicious. After that we moved onto the Market Kitchen, a food stall with a dference their menu on any morning depends on what all the speciality stalls around them are selling that day. We had sourdough with tahini and pumpkin puree, kale and chilli - out of this world! An interesting and worthwhile tour for visiting friends or family, stag and hen weekends or business trips. * Including overnight accommodation with breakfast and a Fab Food Trail, prices start from £ per room based on two people sharing.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Femen group claimed responsibility.Last to arrive was Russian President Vladimir Putin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was positioned in pride of place between President Trump and Mr Macron, a powerful symbol of victors and vanquished now standing together, shoulder to shoulder.Overhead, fighter jets ripped through the sky, trailing red, white and blue smoke.Russian President Vladimir Putin arrives to attend the commemoration The geographical spread of the leaders in attendance showed how the ldquowar to end all wars left few corners of the earth untouched but which, little more than two decades later, was followed so quickly and catastrophically by the even deadlier World War Two.On the other side of the globe, Australia and New Zealand held ceremonies to recall how the war killed and wounded soldiers and civilians in unprecedented numbers and in gruesome new, mechanised ways.Those countries lost tens of thousands of soldiers far away in Europe and, most memorably in the brutal  battle of Gallipoli, in Turkey.In Paris, the jewel that Germany sought to capture in  but which the Allies fought successfully to defend, the armistice commemorations were being followed by the afternoon opening of a peace forum pushed by the host, Mr Macron.President Trump will be the most notable absentee at the forum, where Mr Macronrsquos defence of multi-lateralism will take centre stage.President Trump lives by an ldquoAmerica First credo, and plans to visit the American cemetery at Suresnes on the outskirts of Paris before heading home.On Saturday, he was criticised for cancelling a visit to the Belleau Wood battleground north-east of Paris because of rain.In the four years of fighting, remembered for brutal trench warfare and the first use of gas, France, the British empire, Russia and the United States had the main armies opposing a German-led coalition that also included the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires.Almost  million soldiers died, sometimes tens of thousands on a single day.The United States came late to the war, in April , but over one-and-a-half years it became a key player in the conflict and tipped the scales for the allies.When the war ended, the US armed forces was on the cusp of becoming the major military power in the world.Even though Germany was at the heart of provoking two world wars over the past century, the nation has become a beacon of European and international cooperation since..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: World leaders gather in Paris a century after WWI armistice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

secretary Emily Thornberry told the BBC:ldquoYou cannot simply come to the House of Commons with a bit of nonsense that makes no sense.ldquoYou cannot expect the Labour Party to save you from your own backbenchers who are saying this deal makes no sense ndash and everybody knows it doesnrsquot make sense.The comments came after hardline Tory Brexiteers and the DUP joined forces to warn they are prepared to vote down Mrs Mayrsquos EU withdrawal plans.In a stark warning to the PM, Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the -member European Research Groupof Conservative backbenchers, and the DUPrsquos Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, said they would oppose any agreement which they thought threatened the union and could put a trade border down the Irish Sea.Writing in The Sunday , they said: ldquoWe share the Prime Ministerrsquos ambition for an EU free trade agreement, but not at any price, and certainly not at the price of our union.ldquoIf the Government makes the historic mistake of prioritising placating the EU over establishing an independent and whole UK, then, regrettably, we must vote against the deal.With the shock resignation of pro-Europe transport minister Jo Johnson continuing to cause ructions in Tory ranks, Mrs May is running out of time to seal an EU exit agreement.Hope of getting the Cabinet to sign off on Brexit deal proposals this week appeared to be rapidly receding, as it was reported the EU had rejected Londonrsquos plans for an independent arbitration clause that could allow the UK to quit a backstop deal on the Northern Ireland border.In the wake of Mr Johnsonrsquos resignation, there have been reports that other ministers are considering quitting over Brexit.Brexiteers have insisted that the UK should not get involved with a potentially permanent backstop customs union agreement with the EU as the price of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title:

I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni. try catch     .               ..

Many staff doing the same jobs are on dferent pay scales and people are confused about who to contact about issues.“I along with Cllr Margaret Tinsley have raised this issue since the council began and to date we still do not have a final council structure.“I understand that every other council in Northern Ireland has long since completed this task and we are still dithering. “Indeed, some councils are reviewing their original structure and doing this for the second time and we haven’t even got it done once.“I again raised these issues at every committee and at full council in May June. It has gotten to the stage that our party is very concerned that the lack of structure is having a detrimental impact on the council’s ability to provide a quality service for our rate payers. “By not having this task completed council’s ability to be proactive and respond \u2028to local needs is being hampered.“The responsibility for the implementation of these structures lies with the most senior officials within the Council and it is about time it was sorted once and for all.“I am calling on the Council to implement a realistic time line for completion of this task to move immediately to ensure every possible effort is made to give our employees and rate payers assurances that this is being taken seriously.“We must ensure our employees know they are valued and appreciated and that any inequalities are immediately corrected.Morale must be boosted and creating the new structure will go some way to helping with that.”A Council spokesperson said: “The Council is going through a period of unprecedented change, the biggest change in Local Government in  years.Raw sewage bubbles up into City Park Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“With three large Councils coming together as one - making the second largest Council in NI - we are working through a number of complex HRissues so that our staff are treated fairly and equitably and structures are fit for purpose, providing the services local people need - whilst providing the best value for ratepayers. “We continue to work in partnership with our Trade Unions and staff to implement a structure that will support our community into the future.

It current plays host to tenants including Nationside, Barclays, Davy and Hays Recruitment.There is also a suggestion that a further , sq ft could be added over the building’s seven storeys, subject to planning permission.Some of the other business tenants include a small Kaffe O coffee kiosk, and Space NK.Gavin Clarke, director of investment at Osborne King, said while a few UK-based investment funds have looked at the building, it could go to someone closer to home.“It’s a landmark building – it’s the first time it’s been on the market in  years.“I thinkcould be local. We have had a few UK-based funds look at it to date.

A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Riccc.jpg","title":"ni house prices outpace uk market","story":"Posted on Wednesday November  by John Mulgrew RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey Northern Ireland homes have avoided a UK-wide dip in prices, according to a new survey. The latest RICS and Ulster Bank Residential Market Survey shows a larger proportion of surveyors pointing to a rise in the average cost of a home. That was a higher level than anywhere  in the UK, during October. It says that “Northern Ireland surveyors are also the most optimistic, looking forward. A net balance of % expects prices to rise in the three months ahead, while a net balance of % expects the number of sales to increase in the same timeframe. Most other regions expect prices and sales activity to fall or be broadly flat in the final quarter”. In terms of supply, the survey pointed to a slight rise in properties coming onto the market in Northern Ireland for the first time in five months. RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey said: “Interest from first time buyers and a strong rental have been two of the factors driving the Northern Ireland housing market, with first time buyers and investors both very active this year. “Surveyors remain confident about the market, despite political and economic uncertainty, and  is shaping up to have been a more positive picture for the housing market than perhaps was initially anticipated.” Terry Robb, head of personal banking at Ulster Bank, said: “As the survey indicates, demand remains relatively strong and we continue to see a good-pipeline of mortgage applications. “Our new paperless mortgage process has generated interest but more fundamentally, interest in the market remains firm from a broad range of mortgage purchasers including first time buyers, home movers and those remortgaging.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
