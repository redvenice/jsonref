Email games@dailymail.co.uk  My boys wanted to play it rather than go on the beach in Barbados...By Beezy Marsh Our household is gripped by the Fortnite-mare, though I can’t recall the exact moment it began. But I can tell you, as a mum to a very tech-savvy 13-year-old boy and his inquisitive 11-year-old brother, once it had my children in its glittery, cartoon-like grasp, its effect has been very hard to control.I’m a very hands-on mother – running around the park, learning to ride horses with the kids and even bouncing on their trampoline on occasion.I have armed myself to the teeth with Nerf guns and foam bullets, built forts out of pillows and learned to karate chop like Jackie Chan for the sake of family togetherness.But one weekend not long after Christmas, all that changed. It wasn’t the fact that my children were getting too old for fun and outdoorsy games.No, it was the arrival on the screens of their computers and Playstation, of a game called Fortnite.I have always allowed them some screen time, though I prided myself on the fact that my oldest boy only got a phone for his 13th birthday a few months back. My husband took on the responsibility of monitoring content they have only ever had access to age-appropriate material – no 18 certificate, sweary, gory shoot-em-up games were ever allowed in our house.          Our household is gripped by the Fortnite-mare, though I can’t recall the exact moment it began says Beezy Marsh, pictured here with her 13-year-old son Idris TaylorSo, when my eldest came home from school and asked if he could get a new game, called Fortnite, because the other kids in his year were playing it together, I couldn’t really see the harm in it. Once it had passed the dad-security checks, it was downloaded on to my son’s computer and also on to the Playstation. Whereas some games cost upwards of £50, the big bonus here was that Fortnite was free! Great.One of our great family traditions on Friday nights after school is to sit and have a film together after dinner but with the prospect of Fortnite-play looming, both of my boys were adamant that they should be allowed to power up the Playstation when we got in.If I had been a bit firmer at the start, perhaps it might have stopped what was to come but I didn’t see the harm in them having a go they’d both worked hard that week. After an hour had elapsed, I went to have a look at what the kids were up to normally I could get away with maybe 20 minutes without some kind of fight breaking out between them, or a Nerf bullet whizzing past my ear, or a demand to go to the park or to the shops to buy sweets.But once they were plugged into Fortnite – with their headsets allowing them to speak to each other via their microphones – there was no shifting them.They were talking to each other in a bizarre language - “On me!” , “Where are we dropping, boys?”, “I got an AR”, “He got a legendary SCAR”. The last two, it turned out, were names for weapons.Did they want any pudding? I had got chocolate ice-cream, their favourite. There was no response. “Shall we go to Risky Reels or Tilted Towers?” asked Number One son.In the end I got two bowls of ice-cream and set them down in front of them. I watched them melt. My kids were stuck to that screen like glue and in the end, I had to shout at them and pull the plug out of the wall to get them off it. And that was just the start of the great Fortnite-mare. They’d get up ridiculously early on a school morning to play before I was out of bed they’d whine and moan to be allowed on after school and would sneak on when my back was turned if I refused.The guinea pig was forgotten, their chores were left undone and I found myself losing my temper with them because every time they were on it, they developed a total deafness to the world around them.And yet, there were positives: they could play with friends who lived miles away, there was no blood in the game, they got to be teddy bears or disco dancers (albeit gun-toting ones) and the graphics in the game were amazing to look at.However, for us, the low point came on a trip of a lifetime to Barbados at Easter when they wanted to stay in and play – you guessed it – Fortnite rather than go to the beach. We pulled the plug and started a slow process of rehabilitation card games, swimming together, actually talking to each other again.Since then, we have allowed them Fortnite at weekends only and during holidays but for a limited time. They know that we ultimately have control over it. And while they spent some Christmas pocket money buying V-bucks, the game’s currency, no amount of pester-power will persuade me to part with any more cash.My biggest hope is that like fidget spinners and slime before them, this craze will have had its day before the summer is out. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/18/4D29926B00000578-5832953-image-a-2_1528823443471.jpg","title":"England striker Jesse Lingard promises fans team long run","story":"    Fabian Delph, Jesse Lingard, Danny Welbeck and John Stones get ready for the official England squad photo yesterday          The bus carrying the England football team arrives at the team hotel in Repino, Russia          The England team bus arrives at the Country Club ForRestMix in Repino, Russia          Harry Kane speaks to the media at St Petersburg\u0027s Pulkovo International Airport ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup          Ruben Loftus-Cheek boards a bus upon arrival at St. Petersburg Pulkovo airport, Russia          Laid back: England (including captain Harry Kane, front left) adopts a more casual look than previous world cups as they board a flight bound for RussiaThe squad were pictured on board their flight, with the images illustrating just how relaxed England are as they head to the World Cup.In stark contrast to the stiff collar approach of past England squads where suits and ties were the requirement, Harry Kane and his band of hopeful heroes were more street cred than ever before.Spurs star Kane, who hopes to lift the World Cup and become the first England captain to do since Bobby Moore in 1966, led his teammates to the plane for Russia this afternoon.Kane, 24, strolled up the steps in a casual track suit with his earphones slung around his neck.           Instead of suits and ties, the team including Marcus Rashford (above) wore tracksuits and trainers for the flight from Birmingham          Their laid back style is part of manager Gareth Southgate\u0027s (above) efforts to lead a more relaxed side as they carry the country\u0027s hopes with them.

because of great crested newts.The singer-songwriter has been forced to commission experts to hunt for the protected amphibians around his sprawling property near Framlingham, Suffolk.After he submitted plans for the Saxon style structure to the local council concerns were raised by the Suffolk Wildlife Trust.It said there were records of great crested newts in the area in 2015 and it is possible that ponds within the site boundaries \u0027could be breeding sites for this species.\u0027A search of the surrounding area will now have to be completed to make sure the singer will not be breaking the law by disturbing the amphibians\u0027 habitat.The proposed chapel includes a 48ft tower and would stand in a new area of woodland which the four-time Grammy winner has planted just yards behind his mansion near his hometown of Framlingham.It would hold a congregation of around 24, and in the application it says it is  \u0027every person\u0027s right to be able to have a place of retreat for contemplation and prayer, for religious observance, celebration of key life and family milestones, marriages, christenings and so forth.\u0027          An artist\u0027s impression of the Saxon Chapel he wants to build on the grounds of his estate in SuffolkThe plans were submitted just a month after Mr Sheeran announced his engagement to girlfriend Cherry Seaborn. A wedding licence would be needed if he planned to marry there.Great crested newts, Britain\u0027s largest newt species, have declined over recent years and are now legally protected.It is illegal to disturb the animals or obstruct access to areas where they live and breed, with the protected area extending up to 550 yards from their breeding ponds, the wildlife trust said.Paul Smith, of Apex Planning Consultants, said: \u0027The applicant has responded promptly to this matter and has also commissioned an appropriate survey that will identify the presence of great crested newts or otherwise, propose mitigation measures as appropriate and recommend measures to enhance bioersity.\u0027          Great crested newts, Britain\u0027s largest newt species, have declined over recent years and are now legally protected          Sheeran has already built a treehouse with conical roofs on a raised platform, a 26ft by 26ft pod described by villagers as a ‘Hobbit Hole’, a hot tub, a covered swimming pool and a wildlife pond on his estate (pictured)These could include bat boxes, swift nesting boxes and native planting, he said.\u0027We were not aware of the historical presence of great crested newts nearby and certainly believe that none exist in the pond nearby to the application site,\u0027 he added.Mr Smith also addressed concerns from people who claim the planned chapel would be unsightly and could draw celebrity-spotters to the area.Responding to one objector who \u0027contends that the chapel will attract attention from the public and media\u0027, Mr Smith said it would be sited on private land approximately 230m from the road.\u0027Therefore we do not agree that at such distance from public land and views it will generate the attention he (the objector) purports,\u0027 he wrote.          Sheeran\u0027s proposal is the latest in a string of developments at the star’s country estate, which has been dubbed Sheeranville by locals\u0027Indeed, his argument somewhat demonstrates why the applicant requires a private chapel for private non-denominational contemplation.\u0027He said claims that the chapel would be \u0027a blot on the landscape, destroying views\u0027 were not based on facts and \u0027discredit the high-quality architecture\u0027.He added that it is common for Suffolk churches to be located on the edge of or outside settlements.\u0027Often, but not entirely because of the 14th century post-plague relocations of villages, this relationship is strongly characteristic of the area,\u0027 he said.\u0027It is also the case that private chapels are generally sited away from their host houses for the purpose of providing a visible feature in the landscape encouraging the contemplation of the viewer.\u0027 The proposal is the latest in a string of developments at the star’s country estate, which has been dubbed Sheeranville by locals.Mr Sheeran has already built a treehouse with conical roofs on a raised platform, a 26ft by 26ft pod described by villagers as a ‘Hobbit Hole’, a hot tub, a covered swimming pool and a wildlife pond.He has also converted a barn into his own pub and recently got permission to build an underground cinema and music room.Mr Sheeran, who is said to be worth £40million, paid £895,000 for his large modern detached farmhouse in June 2012.It was revealed in January that he had also snapped up three other neighbouring houses and nearby farmland to create his own 16 acre estate. An expected decision date on the latest planning application is not available, the council\u0027s website said.    "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/11/4D272EB400000578-0-image-a-1_1528800376038.jpg","title":"Toll booth benefits ancient Act Parliament listed 800 000","story":"    Maggie Taylor and Grahame Penny bought the historic bridge over the River Wye in 2012.

People also commented that the fish\u0027s head is similar to that of a parrot (right)  Chinese fishery expert explained it is a deformed carp, a common freshwater fish (left) although it\u0027s been compared to a pigeon due to its small eyes and rounded head (right)One Facebook user, called \u0027Hong Fang\u0027, questioned: \u0027Is this a cross-breed of carp and dolphin?\u0027While another Facebook user \u0027Duan Yiching\u0027 said: \u0027It looks like a radioactive fish to me.\u0027Fish expert at Natural History Museum told MailOnline that they cannot identify the exact species of the fish but concluded that it is under the group, Cyprinidae, as a carp family.The fish in the video could be showing a deformity known as \u0027pug-head\u0027, which is often seen in fishes, stated the expert.International Union for Conservation of Nature explained that water pollution, genetic mutations and injury early in life could be the possible causes to the abnormal appearance of the fish.Yang Xing, an expert from the Guizhou Fisheries Research Institute, told Guizhou Urban Daily that the bird-headed fish is actually a carp and it\u0027s deformed.The expert said deformation is commonly seen among the freshwater fish species.He carried on explaining the possible causes of the deformation. \u0027One possibly is that the embryo was damaged when it was growing another possibility is that the lack of oxygen in water - due to over-crowded fishing farming - caused the fish\u0027s head to be deformed.\u0027  According to the report, the fish was set free by the anglers after being caught."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/863b7c3848ad505e2727927c5704324ed519be78/0_232_2961_1776/master/2961.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bffa09cb3a1e590bf9c4383744b739a","title":"library explores british defence of german degenerate art","story":"Display to tell story of major UK exhibition held in 1938 to counter Nazi propagandaThey were often innocuous landscapes, conservative portraits and colourful modernist abstract paintings of nothing in particular, but to the Nazis the artworks were “sick”, “twisted” and “filth”. The story of German “degenerate art” and the British defence of it is to be told in a display opening to the public on Wednesday at the Wiener library in London, the world’s oldest archive of material on the Holocaust and the Nazi era.It will tell the story of a groundbreaking exhibition of German art held in July 1938 at the New Burlington galleries in London as a direct response to the famous “degenerate art” exhibition staged by the Nazis in Munich in 1937. The latter displayed works by artists including Ernest Ludwig Kirchner, Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky, with labels such as “an insult to German womanhood” and “nature as seen by sick minds”. The former showed work by many of the same artists in a more celebratory mood. The flyer told potential visitors, with remarkable understatement: “Much of this art is now in official disfavour in the country of its origin”.It was an important exhibition and showed more than 300 works, according to Barbara Warnock, a co-curator of the Wiener display. “It remains the largest exhibition of modern German art that there has ever been in Britain.”The Wiener has borrowed two paintings that were in the original show: Max Slevogt’s The Panther, 1931, and Emil Nolde’s The Young Academic, 1918. Ironically, Nolde was a supporter of the Nazi party. He was neither Jewish nor communist, but he was an expressionist and so was condemned.Warnock said the intention was to highlight the wider context and the human stories around the 1938 exhibition.For example, the Nolde was loaned to the 1938 show by Ernst Nelkenstock, a Jewish German lawyer forced out by the Nazis who resettled with his family in London in 1936. Unable to practise law in Britain, he opened a butcher’s shop. In 1947 he and his family became naturalised Britons and changed their name to Norton.The display includes reproductions of some of the 1938 works, including Max Pechstein’s Fishermen’s Horses, 1919, Kandinsky’s Untitled Improvisation II, 1914, and Max Liebermann’s 1925 portrait of Albert Einstein.The portrait was probably sent to the exhibition by Liebermann’s widow, Martha, who was still in Berlin, in the hope it would be sold. It was bought by the Royal Society, but whether the funds reached Germany is unknown. Martha Liebermann killed herself in March 1943, aged 85.The Wiener display also includes artefacts and documents from its archives telling the story of displaced Jews arriving in Britain before the war.One pamphlet given out to all Jewish German and Austrian refugees reads: “The traditional tolerance and sympathy of Britain and the British Commonwealth towards the Jews is something which every British Jew appreciates profoundly.”It goes on to advise refugees to be be patriotic and loyal and not to speak German in public if they can help it.• London 1938: Defending ‘Degenerate’ German Art is a free display at the Wiener Library in London, 13 June – 14 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5149a063cd009d69dc1e90437cc5f881682ec626/0_263_5235_3141/master/5235.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d0f609255ca54f6d75238cf80c46075","title":"vase found in french attic sells for 143m at auction","story":"Imperial 18th-century Qianlong vase sets record for Chinese porcelain sold at auction in FranceAn 18th century vase discovered in an attic has fetched €16.2m (£14.3m) in France.The recently discovered treasure from imperial China sparked a 25-minute bidding war at Sotheby’s.Discovered in the attic of a French family home, it was removed from the container it was found in and taken into the auction house in Paris in a shoe box.The exact history of the vase before 1947 has not been traced.The vase achieved a record for any Chinese porcelain sold at auction in France after it went under the hammer in Paris.Henry Howard-Sneyd, Sotheby’s chairman of Asian Art, Europe and Americas, said: “Chinese art has been admired and collected across Europe for centuries, but the importance of certain pieces is occasionally lost over time.“Given the huge appetite for Chinese art among today’s collectors, now is the moment to scour your homes and attics, and to come to us with anything you might find!”The vase features a landscape with deer, cranes and pine trees, all symbols of health and longevity.The imperial 18th century Yangcai Famille-Rose porcelain object, which features a mark from the reign of the Qianlong emperor, was left to the grandparents of the present owners by an uncle.The vase, produced for the courts of the Qianlong emperor (1735-1796), is the only known example of its kind.

In China, the man who famously once described racism as “a disease of white people” describes the “industrious, filthy, obtuse people” he observes. He notes how the “Chinese don’t sit on benches while eating but squat like Europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods. All this occurs quietly and demurely. Even the children are spiritless and look obtuse.” After earlier writing of the “abundance of offspring” and the “fecundity” of the Chinese, he goes on to say: “It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.”Ze’ev Rosenkranz, senior editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology, said: “I think a lot of comments strike us as pretty unpleasant – what he says about the Chinese in particular.“They’re kind of in contrast to the public image of the great humanitarian icon. I think it’s quite a shock to read those and contrast them with his more public statements. They’re more off guard, he didn’t intend them for publication.”Rosenkranz has edited and translated The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein, which have just been published for the first time as a standalone volume by Princeton University Press, including facsimiles of the diary pages. The diaries have only previously been published in German as part of the 15-volume Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, with small supplementary translations into English. A spokesperson for Princeton University said: “This is the first time Einstein’s travel diary will be made available to anyone who isn’t a serious Einstein scholar.”In Colombo in Ceylon, Einstein writes of how the locals “live in great filth and considerable stench at ground level” adding that they “do little, and need little. The simple economic cycle of life.” Einstein’s perceptions of the Japanese he meets are, in contrast, more positive: “Japanese unostentatious, decent, altogether very appealing,” he writes. “Pure souls as nowhere else among people. One has to love and admire this country.” But Rosenkranz points out that he also concludes that the “intellectual needs of this nation seem to be weaker than their artistic ones – natural disposition?”“Einstein’s diary entries on the biological origin of the alleged intellectual inferiority of the Japanese, Chinese, and Indians are definitely not understated and can be viewed as racist – in these instances, other peoples are portrayed as being biologically inferior, a clear hallmark of racism. The disquieting comment that the Chinese may ‘supplant all other races’ is also most revealing in this regard,” writes Rosenkranz.“Here, Einstein perceives a foreign ‘race’ as a threat, which … is one of the characteristics of a racist ideology. Yet the remark that must strike the modern reader as most offensive is his feigning not to understand how Chinese men can find their women sufficiently attractive to have offspring with them. In light of these instances, we must conclude that Einstein did make quite a few racist and dehumanising comments in the diary, some of which were extremely unpleasant.”Rosenkranz told the  that although views like Einstein’s were prevalent at the time, they were not universal. “That’s usually the reaction I get – ‘we have to understand, he was of the zeitgeist, part of the time’ – but I think I tried here and there to give a broader context. There were other views out there, more tolerant views,” he said.In his introduction, Rosenkranz writes how it is important to explore how a humanist icon such as Einstein – whose image was once used for a UNHCR campaign with the slogan “A bundle of belongings isn’t the only thing a refugee brings to his new country. Einstein was a refugee” – could have written xenophobic comments about the peoples he encountered.“The answer to this question seems very relevant in today’s world, in which the hatred of the other is so rampant in so many places around the world,” he writes. “It seems that even Einstein sometimes had a very hard time recognising himself in the face of the other.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74ffb028ed2b00360b3e7d2b3254c7925f31bfd6/0_259_1779_1067/master/1779.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=803deea60dcc03bb802902143b8e4e69","title":"ben jerrys joins the campaign to support onshore windfarms","story":"With names like Strawberry Breezecake and Cherry Gale-cia, ice-cream maker pushes for government re-thinkTubs of Strawberry Breeze-cake, Cherry Gale-cia and other wind-themed ice-creams will feature in a campaign by Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s to persuade the government to rethink its opposition to onshore windfarms.The renamed flavours will be sold at half price on “windy Wednesdays” to support a pro-renewables push by the Unilever-owned firm, which has a history of campaigning on climate change and environmental issues.The company’s intervention comes amid an industry lobbying effort to convince ministers to scrap obstacles for onshore windfarms.They have largely stopped being built since the Conservatives ended subsidies and introduced planning reforms.Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s drive will feature a tour of the UK, including London, Birmingham and Bristol, to encourage people to take action supporting the technology.

The 66-year-old former vice-chancellor of Oxford University will handle discussions with shareholders about the financial package handed to Sorrell on his exit. Some investors are angry that he is being treated as a “good leaver”, entitling him to at least £14m in payments, despite a lack of transparency about the allegations levelled against him.Role: senior independent director, non-executiveTime with company: four yearsPay in 2017: £91,000The former president of Sony Entertainment is a highly respected legal mind who has provided legal counsel for a string of major companies and is a former clerk for a US supreme court justice.

She also has far-reaching experience in corporate responsibility and governance.He has vehemently denied the allegations but has refused to elaborate, citing a non-disclosure agreement signed with WPP when he left.Despite the secrecy, WPP’s pay policy allows Sorrell to pick up future share awards worth up to £20m because he is designated a “good leaver”.Shareholder advisory groups including Glass Lewis, Pirc and Hermes EOS have recommended voting against the pay deal, saying opacity around his departure makes it hard for investors to assess whether he is entitled to it.City investment firm Royal London Asset Management said it would vote against the pay report but not due to Sorrell’s exit package.Instead it cited “really high levels of incentive pay on offer during 2017”, when WPP handed Sorrell a pay deal worth £48m, a year after investors protested against an even more generous package worth £70m, one of the largest in UK corporate history.RLAM will also vote against the reappointment of company pay chief Sir John Hood over “long-held concerns on pay” and will abstain on the reappointment of Quarta. The investment firm has doubts over Quarta’s ability to juggle the executive chairmanship of WPP with his chairman’s role at FTSE100 medical supplies firm Smith \u0026amp Nephew.The two giant US pension funds Calstrs and Calpers have published their votes, with the former set to vote against Quarta but not WPP’s pay report, while Calpers protests on pay but backs directors.As well as Quarta’s multiple jobs, the Italian-American businessman is expected to face criticism over a lack of succession planning and the fact that Sorrell was not bound by a non-compete clause preventing him from setting up a rival.The industry veteran, who took over a wire shopping basket maker in 1985 and turned into the world’s largest advertising empire comprising a network of 400 companies, has already set up a new venture called S4.He has put £40m of his own money into the company, topped up by a £11m from investors, and has said he wants to make acquisitions in “data, technology and content”. Financial backers have made commitments to plough in a further £150m to fund buyouts.They are understood to include financier Lord Rothschild, Toscafund founder Martin Hughes, Saracens rugby club owner Nigel Wray, investment firm Schroders, private bank Lombard Odier and asset manager Miton.Mark Read, WPP’s chief operating officer appeared to make a pitch to succeed Sorrell on Tuesday, sending an email to all staff promising a review of the company’s rules around conduct.Read, chief executive of WPP’s digital marketing agency Wunderman, reminded staff of the company’s “values” following bullying allegations against Sorrell.“When I come to work I expect to be treated with respect by my colleagues, and every one of you reading this has the right to expect the same,” he said.“You will no doubt have read the press coverage this week about WPP and Martin Sorrell, including allegations about his behaviour towards people at the parent company.“Although we can’t comment on specific allegations, I feel we should remind ourselves of and reinforce the kind of values we want and need to have within every part of our business: values of fairness, tolerance, kindness and – again – respect.“It should hardly need saying that all WPP working environments must be places where people feel safe and supported. They must also be places where people are able to raise concerns if they want to, and where those concerns are dealt with when they need to be.”WPP could also face a class action lawsuit after US specialist law firm Pomerantz said it was investigating concerns raised by investors about potential securities fraud and “unlawful business practices”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc5615b977b25e5abe3648f7387debc3386463f/0_0_3506_2104/master/3506.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d46e78bcdc52a50a5f338400a061bc7b","title":"could berlin tegel airport be reborn as a nightclub","story":"Tegel airport is being eyed up as a new venue – but plans are meeting with ambivalence as clubbers see their subculture becoming more mainstreamBerlin’s clubbing scene has long taken a creative approach to issues of space, setting events in former power stations, drained swimming pools and public toilets. Now its main airport is joining the list of alternative venues.With Tegel airport set to close following the long-awaited opening of Berlin Brandenburg airport, currently scheduled for October 2020, plans are already being made for the next chapter in its history. Last month Berlin’s culture minister, Klaus Lederer, and Lutz Leichsenring of the Club Commission joined project planners for a tour of Tegel to imagine it reborn as a nightclub.Tegel’s air traffic control towers, expansive hangar and soundproof jet engine testing hall were highlighted as potential spaces for a mixture of temporary and permanent music venues for open-air festivals, studios and clubs. The vision for Tegel also includes new housing and a tech hub. “A whole new district of the city will be born,” says Daniel Bartsch, spokesman for Lederer. “I think Tegel will become a figurehead for the city’s modernity and ersity.”Leichsenring was especially enthusiastic about the possibilities of a basement space he was shown complete with metal pipes, machinery and a readymade industrial aesthetic: “It reminded me of the space underneath the swimming pool in Stattbad Wedding, a former club in Berlin.”Architecture is important to Berlin’s clubbing scene, Leichsenring says: “The Berlin scene doesn’t want anything too clean or chic. It focuses instead on the basics: having a good soundsystem and good bookings. And it is always good to have a building where you see the history when you walk in. Berlin clubs like to work with the shape and the soul of the building.”Situated 8km north-west of the city centre, Tegel’s site was originally used for rocket testing during the second world war and was set to be turned into allotments due to severe bomb damage. However, the first plane landed there in November 1948 after a runway was built in just 90 days to help support Tempelhof airport during the Berlin airlift, when Allied forces in the late 40s broke the Soviet blockade of west Berlin by airlifting goods in directly. It’s been the city’s key passenger airport since the 1970s. Tegel has been operating far longer than intended, though, with the Berlin-Brandenburg originally due to open in 2012. Technical issues, scandals and multiple delays in its construction have turned it into a running joke among Berliners, with a majority voting to keep Tegel open in a nonbinding referendum last year. Critics, however, argue Tegel’s concrete hexagonal terminal building and infrastructure are ill-equipped to meet the city’s growing number of air passengers.Clubbing has also changed a lot in recent decades, as the formerly countercultural scene has been subsumed into the city’s brand. “When the Club Commission was set up in 2000, the club scene was associated with drugs and criminals,” says Leichsenring. “Now it is widely accepted to be part of the DNA and appeal of the city.”He founded the Creative Footprint nonprofit organisation to research live music venues in the city and protect its nightlife from the increasing pressures of regulation, rising rents and property development. “It is very important that with Tegel we talk about building additional clubbing space for the city, and not somehow giving up what we already have,” he says. “Over the years many, many clubs have had to close.”Ben de Biel, a photographer and former club owner, laments the lack of suitable sites: “In the first few years after the wall fell there were so many empty spaces. The first club I opened was in 1991 in an illegally squatted set of flats. It was easy: we found a house, had a look around, broke in, changed the locks and then started a club. Today there is little affordable empty space for clubs left.”De Biel says Tegel’s remote location is less likely to be a drawback to clubbers than the process of its development. He can point to a number of clubs that have thrived outside the S-Bahn train line circling the city centre, but adds: “Normally the clubbing scene itself decides what could be an interesting or sexy site.”Sven von Thülen, DJ and co-writer of the Sound of Family, an oral history of the Berlin clubbing scene, is sceptical of the plans. “I cannot see people from Berlin actually going there,” says Thülen. “I can only see it being a tourist trap. “For a long time Berlin clubs were about reclaiming the city and revitalising forgotten spaces. They were developed from the bottom up … Tegel could be an interesting physical space but it would be a top-down development, a kind of sanitised place.”Considering the ongoing saga of the new Brandenburg airport, it is unlikely Berlin clubbers will get the chance to head to Tegel any time soon. Yet the ambivalence over the proposed club feels fitting in a city that has seen its clubbing subculture become mainstream and its previously squatted venues turn into prime real estate.Leichsenring is keen to ensure the Tegel redevelopment is an opportunity for smaller grassroots groups to develop organically. He envisages it as not only an open-air festival space, but a site for exhibitions, creative agencies, markets, recording studios and rehearsal rooms.“The clubbing scene in Berlin doesn’t need any more commercial spaces,” he says. “We need more accessible space for experimentation, for new sounds, and for communities. We don’t want one club where you can just drop 5,000 people in there at the weekend – we want lots of smaller creative cells, and these spaces don’t need lots of investment.“You basically just have to rip everything out of them and start the first party.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c10e06ed7e440795d713aae7f33e1eae4f72af25/0_306_4600_2761/master/4600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=388b92dce98c88812060729280c4b47f","title":"the guardian view on the ethics of ai its about dr frankenstein not his monster","story":"Frankenstein’s monster haunts discussions of the ethics of artificial intelligence: the fear is that scientists will create something that has purposes and even desires of its own and which will carry them out at the expense of human beings.

The senior management at Google saw the supply of AI to the Pentagon as a goldmine, if only it could be kept from public knowledge. “Avoid at ALL COSTS any mention or implication of AI,” wrote Google Cloud’s chief scientist for AI in a memo. “I don’t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspenable weapons for the Defense industry.”That, of course, is exactly what the company had been doing. Google had been subcontracting for the Pentagon on Project Maven, which was meant to bring the benefits of AI to war-fighting. Then the media found out and more than 3,000 of its own employees protested. Only two things frighten the tech giants: one is the stock market the other is an organised workforce. The employees’ agitation led to Google announcing six principles of ethical AI, among them that it will not make weapons systems, or technologies whose purpose, or use in surveillance, violates international principles of human rights. This\u0026nbspstill leaves a huge intentional exception: profiting from “non-lethal” defence technology.Obviously we cannot expect all companies, still less all programmers, to show this kind of ethical fine-tuning. Other companies will bid for Pentagon business in the US: Google had to beat IBM, Amazon and Microsoft to gain the Maven contract. In China the state will find no shortage of people to work on its surveillance apparatus, which uses AI techniques in what may well be the world’s most sophisticated system for spying on a civilian population.But in all these cases, the companies involved – which means the people who work for them – will be actively involved in maintaining, tweaking and improving the work. This opens an opportunity for consistent ethical pressure and for the attribution of responsibility to human beings and not to inanimate objects. Questions about the ethics of artificial intelligence are questions about the ethics of the people who make it and the purposes they put it to. It\u0026nbspis not the monster, but the good Dr Frankenstein we\u0026nbspneed to worry about most."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89e1a1812eee271383b0fb9c3de449aeed77424f/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdd1379d5737cf95b689bb82674c1e8a","title":"straight eye for the queer guy owen jones gets a much needed makeover","story":"Declared the ninth-worst-dressed man in the UK, Owen Jones has not found being gay equals having good fashion sense. Can the ’s style squad change things?The first time I went on the BBC’s Question Time, in February 2012, I wanted to make a decent impression. The fact that I looked like Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone wouldn’t play in my favour – on my Twitter feed, people regularly queried whether I was taking time off from my paper round when I appeared on TV. But my then flatmate Liam took pity, and promised to leave out a special, smart-looking shirt.I found it laid out for me in our flat, and felt much more confident when I put it on. Fashion was not my forte, but at least, I thought, I had made a real effort. There I was in Nottingham, with big political beasts including John Prescott and Ken Clarke on the panel with me and, for a change, I had made a concession to expectations. It went well. Afterwards I called Liam to thank him. “But Owen,” he protested, “you didn’t take the shirt, you took my girlfriend’s blouse.”It’s fair to say that clothes are not my thing. If you need evidence, here it is: in 2016, GQ magazine named me the ninth-worst-dressed man in Britain – worse than Chris Evans. Growing up closeted near the centre of Stockport, I did everything I could to blend in – a massive dollop of gel, hair combed forward, Kappa tracksuits before graduating to Ben Sherman shirts – then, with a hint of teenage rebellion, I bleached my hair and pierced my eyebrow. I looked like a boyband reject, basically. Unfortunately, when I came out at the age of 20 (originally as bisexual, ruining it for genuine bis by fuelling the whole “bi now gay later” shtick), I was not magically endowed with a set of gay skills such as “being spontaneously sassy” or “having a great wardrobe”. A female friend said to me: “Oh great, now we can go shopping together!” But I hate shopping. I have nightmares about shopping.Thirteen years later, watching the Netflix show Queer Eye is a joy: here’s a show in which five queer men come to the rescue of mostly straight men, who are often imprisoned by their unreconstructed masculinity and struggling to find genuine happiness as a consequence. They teach them how to cook, groom, do up their homes, talk about their feelings and, yes, dress. Before I watched the show – a reboot of the early-00s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy – I worried that it would reduce gay men to this season’s amusing must-have accessories. It always struck me when I was growing up that the portrayal of gay men on television was either as one-dimensional, desexualised camp clowns as the butt of jokes or as would-be sexual predators. But Queer Eye upends all this. I fell in love with the show, and every one of the fab five, instantly. One of my favourites is Jonathan Van Ness, a hairdresser who unashamedly embraces camp: an important role model for gay men who all too often fetishise being “straight acting” (as I once did) and can be horribly prejudiced to those deemed camp. I wish my younger self could have watched a show featuring gay men as superheroes, coming to help straight men struggling with their own heterosexuality.Frankly, though, I’m a proud queer man who needs as much assistance as any of the straight men in the show. I may no longer care about how “gay” I’m judged to be, but I have developed no interest in clothes whatsoever. That’s not uncommon, by the way, among people attracted to members of the same gender who depart from heterosexual norms. Gay, I’m afraid, is not a synonym for sharp dresser.So it was suggested to me by my colleagues that perhaps I could use some styling that there could be an afternoon at  HQ that would amount to straight eye for the queer guy. I was a little apprehensive. Spending an afternoon trying on clothes normally strikes me as about as enjoyable as a night out with Ukip’s youth wing. Fortunately, fashion queen Jess Cartner-Morley and stylist Helen Seamons could see I was nervous, and put me at ease.I turned up wearing a grey hoodie and jeans – standard – and worried they would have got in gold-lined Prada shirts. It wasn’t just the inevitable Twitter storm – CLOTHES LOVING SOCIALIST HYPOCRITE!!! – that I was worried about I also have an aversion to splashing out more than, say, £50 on a shirt. Anything more just seems like a surrender to rampant commercialism. Thankfully, they had thought about all that, and as I eyed up the clothes, I was reassured that none were more than a notch up from high-street prices. I was relieved that I could imagine myself wearing any of them – other than a bright pink Hawaiian shirt that was a bit midlife crisis.Wow, I thought after putting on the first set, I’m wearing clothes that actually fit, rather than throwing on some random crumpled shirt hidden under a generic grey jumper before debating a rightwing thinktanker on Sky News. Some of them I quite liked: a swanky green jacket and a navy blue suit that made me look almost respectable. The bright red T-shirt needs a contrast button, and one of the jacket and trouser combos made me look like a not-very-hench bouncer. Throughout, Helen kept skilfully adjusting the clothes, and jokey patter with her and Jess made an otherwise slightly absurd scenario tolerable. I’m not going to lie, though: it was not me.I guess my perspective on clothes has always been: this is really superficial why should anyone care when I go on TV I’m just trying to get my opinion across, how I look is irrelevant. But this is a bit naive. Perhaps it shouldn’t matter, but it does. Leftwingers are at an automatic disadvantage because they are arguing for a radical departure from the current order therefore, how they present themselves matters. Demanding a crackdown on tax avoidance while wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt will probably attract raised eyebrows more than anything else. It’s OK to look smart and rail against injustice. I’m told some revolutionary sects – such as Militant, of which my late father was a member – encouraged their members to avoid dressing like a radical. John Prescott, meanwhile, has talked of attending Oxford’s Ruskin College as a working-class trade unionist: “I remember our first lecture, all the middle-class guys turned up in their revolutionary gear, we turned up in our suits.”Last year, I did a photoshoot for GQ to accompany an interview: they didn’t tell me the suit they had asked me to wear was worth £1,000, but several rightwing blogs certainly found out. “Owen Jones discusses the ‘crisis of capitalism’ in a £1,000 jacket,” crowed the Spectator. But actually – even though I didn’t own the jacket – this patronises so many young working-class people who (unlike me) pride themselves on what they wear, and often save up for months to splash out on designer items.When my  colleagues asked me to do a photoshoot as a gay man who doesn’t exude style, I was a bit bemused. But, weirdly, I quite enjoyed wearing clothes that looked good and fit me. I doubt I will be crowned Britain’s most stylish man any time soon. But there’s nothing wrong with priding yourself on how you look it turns out it doesn’t make you some superficial bourgeois traitor. Don’t expect me to start embracing Gucci socialism, but maybe I’ll stop treating shopping as a slightly less enjoyable exercise than dental surgery. You can want to change the world without looking like a dishevelled paper boy.GQ were way harsh. Helen and I agree on that, looking through photos of pre-makeover Owen. He’s a good-looking man, he just needs sharpening up a bit. The logic behind his trademark shirt-and-jumper look is that instead of ironing a shirt he puts a jumper over the top to hide the creases. Often, part of the shirt collar is sticking up, or has got tucked inside the jumper, so you can tell he didn’t look in the mirror before going on camera. That tells you everything about what Owen thinks about clothes – he doesn’t.Owen looks relieved that the clothes Helen wants him to wear aren’t flamboyant. “A style overhaul isn’t about wearing lots of colour,” she explains. “In fact, keeping to a minimal palette will help you look sharp.” The idea is professional and presentable, rather than suited and booted. Black jeans that have faded to grey are swapped for dark Japanese-look denim. A smarter shoe takes a jeans-based outfit out of Student Union territory a smart bomber jacket pulls a look together in a way that Owen’s grey hoodie doesn’t. Detail is key: Helen turns up jeans, rolls up T-shirt sleeves, quietly but firmly warns him off lumpily stuffing pockets with phones and keys.I suspect fashion may never be a passion of Owen’s, but the reality of life in the public eye is that clothes are noticed, and judged, whether you like it or not. So it makes sense to try to control, or at least be aware of, the messages you are giving out. Our shoot is tightly sandwiched between speaking engagements – one about Erdoğan, one about Gaza – but when Helen tells Owen the stores these clothes came from (Arket, Cos, new online brand FoR) he writes the names down on his phone for future reference, and I don’t think he’s just doing it to be polite. I don’t think we converted Owen to the fashion cause. But I hope we made him realise we’re not the enemy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baad57b071357334e23f323123d2d35307585ef7/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8be3883c3fa61119a8dc789cdd61bb36","title":"superfly review a sleek swaggering blaxploitation remake","story":"Director X’s take on the 1972 crime drama is a brutal, visually indulgent saga of extravagance and racial tensions The new remake of blaxploitation staple Superfly starts to feel like a pornographic film somewhere around the shower-set threesome, the steamiest sex scene that a major American studio has allowed in years. But even before that refreshingly indelicate display, Director X adopts pornography’s absolute commitment to the pleasure principle in his fixation on the spectacle of luxury. The first 20 minutes drag the viewer through a neon-lit vortex of raining money, unfathomably expensive cars, zaftig strippers, golden guns and narcotic bricks. This high-gloss take on Gordon Parks Jr’s funky vision of the hustle goes so far into sheer, unabashed rap-video excess that calling it gratuitous would miss the point.Until it suddenly, brutally isn’t. In a crime saga sampling White Heat, Goodfellas and just about every other classic from the gangster era to the gangsta’s, X reiterates the timeless hood adage that when you live by the gun, you die by it too. Well-to-do pusherman Youngblood Priest (Trevor Jackson) is well aware, fitting squarely into the film’s rigid moral code by virtue of a desire to get out of the game. He knows nobody can escape consequences for long, as X metes out immediate punishment from on high for the cardinal sins of disrespect and disloyalty, and Youngblood would rather quit while he’s ahead. With his right-hand man Eddie (Jason Mitchell), he plots a job without their usual connection, Scatter (karate master Michael K Williams, worth the price of admission alone) and utters the accursed words of One Last Job. Cue recklessness, cue folly in blood, cue all-out war with the rival Snow Patrol gang. No, not that Snow Patrol.While Youngblood may be the dope-dealing black Übermensch – his sexual potency is such that he requires not one, but two girlfriends – in this instance, X is the true OG. His bona fides in the world of hip-hop, where he’s been a go-to music video director for two solid decades, are the production’s greatest asset. Beyond enlivening the downbeat scenes with lurid colors nicked from the Hotline Bling clip, he capitalizes on his acumen with details that make the film feel lived-in and personal. This numbers among a small cadre of films shot during Georgia’s tax break-fueled production boom that embrace the character of Atlanta instead of disguising it as another city. A host of local talent fills out the soundtrack, trap-rap legends make inspired cameos, and X conjures all of the weatherbeaten beauty that ATL has to offer. The jargon-heavy dialogue may leave less-hip viewers lost, but it’s still the most naturalistic, plausible element in a film railing fat lines of powdered implausibility.Though perhaps that sense of innate with-it-ness extends past X’s professional expertise and into his very bones. The racial tensions that sparked the inception of the blaxploitation genre have only grown in intensity, and X includes passages suffused with frustration and conflict owed to Youngblood’s identity as a black man shining in America. The small handful of white characters are not to be trusted, vipers waiting the right moment to wedge their fangs in our hero’s back. They’re broadly drawn, almost cartoonishly evil, and yet the iconography of their misdeeds has a potency of its own, particularly one scene that sees Youngblood express America’s simmering antipathy for cops in cathartic, violent terms. The healthy distrust of institutions that characterizes the best of the blaxploitation canon has been amply applied here, amounting to a bracingly unsubtle assault on white complacency.But X is a firebrand second and minister of indulgence first. Superfly is never more satisfying than when behaving like a series of music videos that exalt in the beauty of slow motion, whether of jiggling thong-clad buttocks or the Michael Mann-styled high-frame-rate action sequences. Extravagance acts as its own currency in the stunt-or-be-stunted-upon culture Youngblood vows to fight his way out of, and X fits right in with his penchant for overflowing aesthetic opulence. The joy of X is often simple and immediate – the leather trenchcoatturtleneck ensemble, the seat-rattling bass of the 808-on-steroids score, a swaggering dolly shot drifting in and out of candy-colored rooms as if in a cross-faded haze. At long last, Hype Williams’ legendary Belly has found a deserving companion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e7216e82e37e7b26d9e68e1075dd627b98f6898/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26552a12185bd765c564f1316b6a41d0","title":"england world cup squad previous tournaments squad","story":"Before kick-off in Russia, England squad members from each World Cup since 1998 reflect on key lessons to be learnedKnocked out by Argentina on penalties in last 16I had no idea whether I was going to get into the squad. I’d had a lot of injuries that season, and in April I was selected for an England B game and Glenn Hoddle said: “I want to take you but you’ve not played enough games.” I didn’t think I was going. Then he announced a 30-man squad with me in it, and we went to a training camp at La Manga. Every session you’re trying to decipher what it means for your place in the squad.Eventually, those of us who made the 22 were told at the hotel, all at the same time. It quickly came out that Paul Gascoigne had been pretty unhappy at missing out, and that’s what people remember. We’d been together for a while and all of a sudden you’re losing some of your colleagues, and as pleased as you are that you’re not one of them, watching those guys head out the door, seeing their sadness, that wasn’t good for the group.I think what Gareth has done is much better. There’s people on standby but everybody knows where they stand. And I like his squad: I think England have always picked players for tournaments because of their reputation. This is the first time I’ve seen a squad genuinely picked on merit.In France we were in a hotel in the countryside. The facilities were fantastic and we had some things to do – a pool table, table tennis – but there’s only so much of that you can play. There are going to be periods of boredom. When you’ve got nothing to do you pick up a newspaper, and that’s when the media scrutiny hits you, and if there’s negative press the squad picks up on it pretty quickly. Gareth has been to tournaments, he’ll know that and he’ll put something in place to stop the boredom kicking in. I would have liked to go out on some trips, to get the players in a group together, away from the hotel. But then if results are bad everyone would have complained that the players were off doing that rather than concentrating on football.Knocked out 2-1 by Brazil in quarter-finalsThere were a lot of injuries in the buildup – David Beckham was coming back from a metatarsal, Kieron Dyer and Steven Gerrard were both affected by injury and replacements were flying in and out. I think if a player’s carrying an injury going into a tournament, they’re never going to get fit enough to come into the team and make a difference. Especially if it’s your star man, the attention it creates, especially if that player doesn’t play to his best, it has a negative impact on the squad. You want to get rid of all that razzmatazz – a player needs to have played at least a couple of games at the end of the season, and the manager needs to be strong enough to make that call.He doesn’t have to only pick players who are in form, though. You need people with international experience, who the manager trusts, but if you’ve got a few players on the fringes of the squad who were in form at the end of the season, they can make a difference.I have good memories of that World Cup. I think it was the most well-organised tournament I went to. There were some big distances to travel but the facilities were fantastic, the pitches were first class and I think every detail was taken care of perfectly. My family came out, and nobody had a murmur of complaint. Plus we beat Argentina. We were a long way from home but at a World Cup that doesn’t make a difference. You’re in your bubble. You could be on the moon and it wouldn’t make a difference.Knocked out by Portugal on penalties in quarter-finalsWe were staying in Baden-Baden and a lot of us had friends and relatives nearby. Seeing my mum and my then girlfriend, having my mates there – and to this day they say it was the best holiday they’ve ever had – was a nice escape. It felt good at the time. But the way the British media reported the fact that our families were out there and enjoying themselves, the way they blew everything out of proportion, I thought was out of order. My mum was having conversations with journalists, having meals with them – they were staying at the same hotel – but then these reporters were stabbing people in the back and sneaking secret cameras around. As players we didn’t like that and maybe it distracted us.Since then the FA have gone down a different route. As a footballer you should be able to focus for a few weeks. I think if players want to see their wives or girlfriends and kids then that’s fine, but if it’s your mates, and your mates’ mates, that crosses the line a little bit. I think the ideal scenario would be for families to be nearby but in a more controlled environment, with the press kept away.Other than that I was pretty happy with everything off the pitch. I felt as a squad we did have togetherness and did mix together. On the pitch, though, there was a ide. You had your starting XI, everyone knew who was in it, and everybody else was made to feel very distant. I was on the bench with the likes of Michael Carrick and Wayne Bridge looking at Sven-Göran Eriksson and thinking: “This guy, no matter how bad we play, he’s never going to change his team.”If any player finds himself in that situation my advice would be: stay focused, because if you get past the quarter-finals, which we nearly did, that’s when injuries and suspensions kick in and you might be needed. But hopefully Gareth Southgate will make sure the ide between the first XI and everybody else never develops.Knocked out 4-1 by Germany in last 16We made two trips to Austria before the tournament, the first a couple of days after the FA Cup final – those of us who’d played at Wembley got two extra days off. So there wasn’t much of a break, and we were together a long time. Then we were stationed out on our own in South Africa, without any entertainment or interaction with the community, nothing to take your mind off football. Some kind of distraction is needed. Retrospectively, that is something I’d have changed, and I don’t think those mistakes will be made again. To get to the end of the season and go straight into a tournament was probably not the right thing, and Gareth Southgate has given the players some rest. You only need about five days. It’s a rest for the mind as much as anything, some time with your family before you go away.I’ve never been one to have families at tournaments. I find it a distraction. It’s a month out of your life, not an eternity. Families can fly in and out and I don’t mind that so much, but the idea of them being permanently around I find quite difficult. After 2006 we went from one extreme to the other, and the middle ground is where you want to be.Once the football starts, all eyes are on you and the scrutiny is intense. We started with a draw against the USA, and if your tournament begins poorly it can be hard to press the reset button and get the confidence flowing again. In 2010 that’s something we certainly didn’t manage. That will be one of Southgate’s big battles, trying to take all the nonsense away from the players, trying not to let any over-the-top negativity infiltrate the team. Once it seeps in unfortunately it does affect performances. At Euro 2004 we got a bit of momentum and had the feeling we could maybe win it. None of the other tournaments I was involved in was like that.Knocked out in group stageI remember when I found out I was going. The announcement was scheduled for about 12pm, and it was nearly then and I hadn’t heard anything. Then I got a text from the FA telling me what time to be at the airport, so I sent one back saying: “Am I in the squad then?” And that’s how I found out, about 10 minutes before it went public.I was made up to be going. I felt that every time Roy Hodgson had called on me I’d produced, and I thought I was going to play a part in the World Cup. In the end I sat on the bench for all but the last three minutes of the Uruguay game. I wasn’t expecting to be in the starting XI but what baffled me was when we needed a goal I was kept on the bench. I was flying at that time and just desperate to get on.We pretty much knew the team and even if the lads had a bad game I don’t think he would have changed it much. That’s been an issue over the years – the team’s been based on names and not form. If I had one bit of advice for Gareth Southgate it would be: change the team, play the right team for every game.When we got to Rio we were staying in a really nice hotel but we just couldn’t leave it. We were in an amazing city but couldn’t see it. A few lads tried to go to the beach and apparently it was just chaos. That was hard at times. Then we had to travel an hour, sometimes more, to training. It wasn’t so far, it was just traffic. The police basically had to shut down Rio to get us there. Maybe a football complex would have been better, somewhere with space to go outside in your free time and training facilities.The way the FA look after the players is amazing. You get treated like kings. But the pressure from the media was something I was not ready for. It shocked me how intense that was and the pressure does creep in. I think the FA bow to the press far too much and if I were Southgate I’d be trying to change that. If damaging stories come out, try to keep the lads away from it and take the pressure off. I’m not saying they should have a drink – those days are gone – but get the players socialising, make sure they have a laugh and let friendships grow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08bee1eef2adccdca27d182479a0a0f727a20aad/11_33_2540_1524/master/2540.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ef7c2015b4c76dbd3da7d170de9a1de","title":"golden goal marcos coll scores from a corner for colombia v ussr 1962","story":"Colombia’s first World Cup appearance has largely been forgotten but midfielder Coll wrote his name into history with a moment of improvisation that remains unique to this dayFor a nation that has recorded just one knockout-stage victory in World Cup history, Colombia have left a particularly vivid imprint on the tournament. From René Higuita racing several miles from his goal at Italia 90 to James Rodríguez’s goal of the 2014 tournament, via the stomach-churning sight of Andrés Escobar stretching to intercept a cross in Pasadena, Colombia’s contribution to the global game is far greater in Technicolour than on paper.Long before Faustino Asprilla, Carlos Valderrama and the legendary Birdman lit up our TV screens, Colombia made their debut in a very different era. Their first World Cup trip – and their only qualification until 1990 – was a short one, travelling to Chile in 1962. They were unfancied outsiders after sneaking through a thin South American qualification pool missing both the hosts and defending champions Brazil – but though they didn’t win a game, one player left his mark on World Cup history.The 1962 tournament sits in the hinterland between the cricket scores of early tournaments and the colour TV breakthrough that made superstars of Pelé, Bobby Moore and Johan Cruyff over the ensuing 15 years. It is perhaps the last World Cup that bears no real resemblance to the supercharged football festivals of the modern era. Chile had orchestrated a slick PR campaign to win hosting rights from under the noses of neighbouring Argentina, but their plans were torn apart by natural disaster.The 1960 Valia earthquake, still the largest ever recorded, caused damage to several prospective host cities, and government support for the tournament was hastily withdrawn with up to two million citizens affected. Only four venues were used in 1962 – three of those, including a Rancagua facility borrowed from a mining company, were close to the capital. The other, in the northern outpost Arica, was where Colombia would play all of their games. The debutants, managed by the Argentina legend Adolfo Pedernera but comprised entirely of unheralded, domestic league-based players, were Group 1’s rank outsiders, drawn alongside the former champions Uruguay and two European giants in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.In one of four opening matches that kicked off simultaneously on 30 May, Colombia took an early lead against Uruguay, the captain Francisco Zuluaga scoring from the spot after 19 minutes, but their opponents rallied in the second half to win 2-1. The next day, the USSR, led by Lev Yashin, widely considered the world’s finest goalkeeper, beat Yugoslavia 2-0 to take control of the group.In their second game, Colombia lined up against the USSR at the Carlos Dittborn Stadium knowing they had to cause an upset to keep their hopes of progress alive. Things didn’t start well – after 11 minutes, they were 3-0 down and on track for a historic beating. Germán Aceros pulled one back but Viktor Ponedelnik’s goal on 56 minutes appeared to end the game as a contest.Twelve minutes later Marcos Coll, a diminutive midfielder from Barranquilla, trotted over to take a corner. As Yashin marshalled his defence, Coll was struck by the Soviets’ height advantage, and how little chance he had of picking out a team-mate. An idea came to him. As the “Black Spider” crept off his line, anticipating a routine catch, Coll aimed a quick shot at his near post – and scored. It remains the only “Olympic goal” – a goal direct from a corner – ever scored at the World Cup. The name derives from a goal scored by Argentina’s Cesário Onzari against Uruguay, the recent Olympic champions in 1924. Onzari took advantage of a new law allowing direct goals from corners, bending the ball into the roof of the net to embarrass their fiercest rivals in Montevideo.Coll’s effort lacked Onzari’s dramatic execution – his shot floated apologetically inside the near post with the Soviet defence dumbfounded. “There was a huge roar,” Coll recalled years later, “because I had scored against the best goalkeeper in the world.” Not that Yashin looks it in this particular clip. Caught on his heels, he begins apportioning blame before the ball hits the net, with the defender stationed on the near post first to get a talking to.With the locals firmly on their side, Colombia poured forward as their opponents struggled to regroup. Antonio Rada toe-poked a cross into the corner just four minutes after Coll’s intervention, before Marino Klinger raced through on goal. Yashin flew off his line, got nowhere near ball or man, and Klinger scored Colombia’s third goal in just eight second-half minutes.The game ended 4-4 – Colombia’s first World Cup point – but the underdogs still needed to beat Yugoslavia to have any chance of reaching the quarter-finals. This was to be no close-run thing – they lost 5-0 – but Coll’s moment of magic proved terminal to the Soviets’ campaign. “What kind of a goalkeeper is not tormented by the goal he has allowed?” Yashin once pondered – and this goal tormented him more than most. The USSR topped the group but their keeper’s confidence did not recover, his poor form contributing to a shock quarter-final defeat to the hosts. If Colombia’s World Cup reputation is built on isolated moments of magic, then the USSR’s (and latterly Russia’s) is grounded in perpetual underachievement. Four years later, Yashin led his team to fourth place in England – still the highest World Cup finish by a Russian side. The host nation appear highly unlikely to buck that trend this summer.As for Coll, he quickly returned to obscurity, playing in his homeland with América de Cali, Deportes Tolima and Atlético Junior. His international career ended in 1962 but the nickname earned in Chile – “El Olimpico” – stuck with him far beyond retirement. His death last June at the age of 81, in his hometown of Barranquila, was headline news across South America.“For me, it was a joy that God gave me that Olympic goal,” Coll said in 2012. “In fifty years, no other player has repeated it. Without a doubt, that goal immortalised me.” This is undeniably true in Coll’s home country, but his singular if unspectacular moment of improvisation, played out in a far-flung group game 56 years ago, has faded from the global consciousness. If his feat is repeated in Russia, of all places, this summer, it should be renamed “the Marcos”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d62207244450131af18054c6afd9c121d7c91f67/1036_86_1161_696/master/1161.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1420c2ad101ee3219044cdbc783c8442","title":"julen lopetegui appointed real madrid manager","story":"Real Madrid have announced that the Spain head coach Julen Lopetegui will take over as manager at the Bernabéu after 2018 World Cup in Russia.Lopetegui has signed a three-year deal with Madrid after two years with the national side, who he has guided to the World Cup in impressive fashion.The timing of the announcement is unexpected, given that Spain kick off their tournament on Friday when they face Portugal in Sochi.Lopetegui, 51, played for Real between 1988 and 1991 as a goalkeeper, making one league appearance, and later turned out for rivals Barcelona a handful of times. He also coached the B team, Castilla, in 2008-09 before joining the national setup as Spain Under-19 coach.He has experienced a modest club career having been sacked by Porto in January 2016 after a trophy-less 18 months at the Estadio do Dragao. That was 11 years after his only previous club job, a brief 11-game spell in charge of Rayo Vallecano in 2003.In May, he signed a two-year extension to remain as Spain coach until 2020 but the call of Madrid has proved stronger.Lopetegui’s appointment comes as a considerable surprise, not just because of the timing as Spain kick off their World Cup against Portugal on Friday, but because his name hadn’t been mentioned at all in Spanish media following Zinedine Zidane’s shock resignation on 31 May.Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp, Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, former Madrid midfielder and youth coach Guti, Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann and Germany national team boss Joachim Low were considered to be on club president Florentino Pérez’s shortlist.Zidane, meanwhile, claims he is taking a break from football after stepping down at the Bernabeu.Speaking at the opening of a children’s playground in Paris on behalf of adidas, he told Diario AS: “Right now, I am taking a break.“I do not know what I will do after, because at the moment the most important thing was the decision that I took. The future? We will see.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63ca12a7a81bd5f1fea52b5d3f6f290ad5f41c71/70_219_3419_2052/master/3419.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b047bbac830e1c189a7f1116984aeed","title":"var world cup referees flag offsides pierluigi collina","story":"Fans inside the World Cup stadiums will be shown replays of incidents requiring video assistant refereeing decisions to reduce the confusion which has reigned during trials of the technology in England and other domestic leagues.Supporters at the tournament in Russia will be shown clips of the passage of play which was under revision but only once the referee has made his decision and play has\u0026nbsprestarted.Pierluigi Collina, the chairman of Fifa’s referees committee, said the problems with lengthy delays during trials this season had been ironed out. The Italian also said assistant referees had been advised to keep their flag down for tight offside calls and to leave it to VAR to decide.“If you see some assistant referee not raising the flag, it’s not because he’s making mistakes,” Collina said. “It’s because he’s respected the instruction to keep the flag down. They were told to keep the flag down when there is a tight offside incident and there could be a very promising attack or a goal-scoring opportunity because, if the assistant referee raises the flag, then everything is finished.”There will then be 13 referees who officiate, exclusively watching the control screens in the video operations room. Collina confirmed the VARs would wear the full kit, identical to their colleagues out on the pitch.“It’s because they sweat like they do\u0026nbspon the pitch,” the Italian former referee said. “It’s not like watching a game on the couch while drinking coffee. It’s very stressful so they can’t be dressed like a clerk.”Néstor Pitana of Argentina will officiate the opening game between Russia and Saudi Arabia at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium on Thursday.Officials have not yet been announced for the group‑stage matches during the tournament but Gareth Southgate, the England manager, insisted on a referee from the\u0026nbspAsian Football Confederation for his team’s final warm-up game against Costa\u0026nbspRica in Leeds.Because of the make-up of Group\u0026nbspG – two European nations, England and Belgium, competing with Tunisia and Panama – it is extremely likely an AFC official will take charge of a game featuring Southgate’s side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ea0a5308e61d385d641aa80ef7cc14556d08f1/137_578_9404_5645/master/9404.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66caa5f307d17aa6adb2f34d5952888d","title":"world cup 2018 32 fans countries preview tournament russia","story":"Supporters from every country that qualified share their hopes and expectations for Russia 2018• Neutral’s choice: who are rest of the world supporting?Moscow can... surprise you every day. It’s an ideal city for sports fans as it has 11 professional football teams and four in the Russian Premier League. Expectations are pretty low for the hosts. Fans don’t consider Stanislav Cherchesov a good coach and we are worried about Russia’s inexperienced defence.Russia will... qualify from the group. But only if Cherchesov finds a way to get the best from a talented squad and understands how to defend without the retired Berezutski brothers. If Russia can avoid Spain in the first knockout match, there is a chance we can go even further.Keep an eye out for... Alexey Miranchuk, an intelligent player who can create the moments that matter. Striker Fyodor Smolov could have a decent tournament too. He wants to leave Krasnodar and move abroad, so he needs good performances this summer. Ilya SokolovThe general mood is... one of excitement. Egypt haven’t been at a World Cup since 1990, so we seem to have forgotten how to celebrate qualification. The streets are draped in red, white and black, and everyone has now become a football analyst. We should just be happy we are at the party.Egypt is... not Liverpool. Mo Salah reached the final of one major tournament this year, but no one seriously expects him to reach another. We just want to see our team play exciting football as representatives of Africa. I would be content if we can get out of the group.Look out for... Ahmed Hegazi and Ramadan Sobhi. Relegated with West Brom and Stoke this season, they will be keen to redeem themselves on the international stage. Legendary 45-year-old goalkeeper Essam El Hadari will hopefully fulfil his dream of captaining Egypt in a World Cup. Ahmed AlyThe country’s emotional state is... euphoric and anxious. Great things are expected. Businesses around Montevideo have decorated their offices in light blue colours and there are World Cup sweepstakes taking place everywhere.Uruguay has... A good chance. There’s a healthy mix of experienced professionals and promising young talents. Luis Suárez and Edinson Cavani carry most of the weight of expectation but we have a very united team and the country has a lot of faith in them.When I was younger... I promised myself that if I ever had a daughter, I would name her Celeste in honour of the national team. Last year Micaela Celeste was born. Natalia TassinoAllowing us to watch football was... about women finally achieving one of their demands. Next up we’ll be able to drive. It’s so amazing to finally see all this empowerment for girls in Saudi Arabia.The country is... very excited about taking part in the World Cup again. Twelve years is a long time to wait for another chance. The Saudi player I’m most excited by is... all of them. We don’t have any star players and go into the tournament with a group mentality. This unity will be the key if we are to go through. Saudi Arabia should be targeting... the heroics of USA 94. Reaching the second round in our first World Cup was incredible. The three group-stage exits that followed were so disappointing in comparison. Sarah AlgashgariThe World Cup... means a lot to us. We have a large population with a strong sense of identity and history, but as a footballing nation we are still relatively inexperienced. Young Iranians feel oppressed and isolated at home, while also constantly misunderstood and stereotyped around the world. Cheering on “Team Melli” is an opportunity to express ourselves. We will... go past our group for the first time. The superb talents of Sardar Azmoun, Alireza Jahanbakhsh, Saman Ghoddos and Masoud Shojaei should give us a chance. It’s hard to look beyond the 2-1 win over USA at France 98 as my favourite World Cup memory. There aren’t that many to choose from. Payam KalantarThe last time we qualified... I was 10 years old. Back in 1998 we were so close to progressing to the last 16, but Brazil somehow lost to Norway. I fancy our chances... against Portugal and Iran but Spain will be on their own planet. Making it out of the group would be a huge success, but not much of a surprise.Our key player will be... Hakim Ziyech, an attacking midfielder who plays for Ajax. Salim ChoudartThe mood is... uncertain. The joy of winning Euro 2016 is still there, giving us hope, but the fact that we just aren’t very good still doesn’t sit very well with many.The minimum expectation is... quarter-finals. Getting out of the group with Spain should be a given but I expect the team to buckle against Argentina or France, the most likely opponents in the quarter-finals.Our creative force in the national team should be... Bernardo Silva. Portugal have lacked a proper attacking playmaker since Deco retired. Ronaldo should play a massive part too, unless he’s fatigued after another long season. Joao MeloBrazil 2014 was... very disappointing. We’ve only just recovered but, if we start well this summer, the belief is La Roja will soon be back.It’s difficult to say... where Spain will end up in the World Cup. There are many wonderful teams and they all want their hands on the trophy. If players such as David Silva, Andrés Iniesta and Isco start on the front foot, we won’t be too far away. Javier PerezAustralia will... never again reach the heights of the performance in 2006, when we were spectacular in Germany. The aim this summer is to get through the group. If the team give their all we shouldn’t be too far away. France are the only team that look unbeatable.The beating heart of our midfield is... Aaron Mooy. His tactical and physical approach shouldn’t be underestimated. He is one of the main reasons Huddersfield remain a Premier League side. His craftsmanship in midfield won’t go unnoticed. James GoughQualifying was... a relief as it is never guaranteed. Our goal is to do better than last time. South Africa in 2010 was a real disappointment but we can definitely make the knockout stages this summer. Then we will probably be destroyed by Argentina.The man with the X-factor is... Christian Eriksen. He’s been on fire for our national team during qualification and inspires younger players such as Pione Sisto, Thomas Delaney and Andreas Christensen. Our team is based around these youngsters. Emil ChristensenThe only thing that can stop us is... overconfidence. We have huge talents but a lack of cohesion. The national team has not evolved as much as we should have since Euro 2016. Didier Deschamps did a very average job with our young players. There’s no real back up for Olivier Giroud our full-backs are not so good and we rely on inidual talents to win us games. I’m not sure if that’s enough to win the World Cup. I would be happy to reach... the semi-finals. Spain, Germany, Belgium and even Brazil look more organised than us. The player who excites me most is... Kylian Mbappé. He already has so much experience and can do a lot of damage with Ousmane Dembélé up front. Antoine Griezmann will be his usual threat. Thomas KamdemThe country is... feverish with anticipation. We’re ecstatic about our first World Cup appearance since 1982. The results are almost inconsequential. I just hope we avoid any embarrassments.Peruvians... Don’t follow rules easily. We work hard and never give up. We’re eternally optimistic.Our national side is... a scrappy team. There are no outstanding players, but Ricardo Gareca has moulded them into a tight, disciplined unit. We go into the tournament hoping for results against Australia and Denmark. France will prove too talented.Our strikers are... near the end of their careers. Paolo Guerrero and Jefferson Farfán can be a potent strike force if they click. Farfan has had a great season in Russia, while Guerrero needs to prove that he still has it after his recent suspension. At the back we rely a lot on centre-back Alberto “el mudo” Rodríguez. Miguel PayetThe mood is... cautiously optimistic, but I don’t think anyone is very reassured by how Argentina have been playing lately.My favourite thing about Argentinian football is... the fans. When I go to see La Albiceleste play, there are always a huge number of enthusiastic and friendly supporters.The most negative thing about the national team is... the high turnover of players and managers. José Pékerman was given far too little time. He would have developed a consistent and mature style of play eventually.I’ve never cheered so loudly as when... Argentina knocked England out on penalties in 1998 – although beating the Netherlands in the 2014 semi-finals came close.If we don’t win the tournament... I hope we bow out gracefully after some memorable performances. MariaMy first World Cup memory... is also my favourite one. Our brave team that lit up France 98 will always be the benchmark for any Croatia team. That was a big thing for an eight-year-old boy. Will we ever finish third again?We should aim for... the semi-finals. There is talent all over the squad, with Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic, Dejan Lovren and Mario Mandzukic the big stars. If they stay fit, another World Cup adventure is very much on. Luka IvezicIf we can get a result against Argentina... you never know what will happen! We are typically optimistic. Iceland doesn’t do national pessimism.Keeping an eye on... Albert Gudmundsson. The winger hasn’t featured much for PSV this season, but he’s our only real alternative to Gylfi Sigurdsson. Tryggvi KristjanssonThe mood is... the usual clash of overblown optimism and deep pessimism. Some always choose to believe we are due an adventurous tournament, while others expect us to crash and burn. I fear it might be the latter.I’d be surprised... if we make the second round. We look unlikely to match Argentina and Croatia for quality, while Iceland’s resolve seems to surpass our own. Our key player is... Wilfred Ndidi. He is an efficient, unfussy footballer. If fully fit, he might earn himself a big move this summer. KiaThe streets of Brazil are... full of green, blue and yellow. Schools are letting students go to classes in their football kits, and classes are cancelled when Brazil are playing. This World Cup... means a lot to us. After all the recent political unrest, corruption and economic uncertainty, the Seleção is not just a team but a symbol of hope. The greatest thing about this team is... we do not depend on just one player. We have Neymar, Coutinho, Firminho, Marcelo, Fernandinho and Thiago Silva. We have a better team than the 1982 one, which was considered the best in our history. Brazilians are... expecting a reaction from the disastrous defeat to Germany four years ago. Every minute of this tournament will be watched. If there’s a ball rolling, we’ll be watching. Pedro Henrique HeinzenThe mood is... cautious. The national team is not in its best form and the toughness of the group also increases the uneasiness among the more skeptical fans. We want to be competitive. I hope we make it to the second round. Getting though such a difficult group will lift our players and we could go even further if confidence grows. Commitment and dedication is a must.The players carrying the hopes of a nations are... Bryan Ruiz, Joel Campbell and Oscar Duarte. If they play well, Costa Rica will have a chance against Switzerland and Serbia.We’ve come a long way since... missing out on the knockout stages of the 2002 World Cup on goal difference. I never though I’d see Costa Rica in a World Cup quarter-final, so the efforts of four years ago will be hard to match. Daniel VillaltaThe Serbia squad is... the most talented in years. Coach Mladen Krstajic has made a positive impression. We haven’t reached a World Cup since South Africa in 2010 and this team is seen as far more promising than the one eight years ago.We should... reach the knockout stages. We can get past Switzerland and Costa Rica, and go through with Brazil. That would likely see us face Germany in the second round. The journey will end there.What excites me most about the team is... the midfield. Luka Milivojevic and Nemanja Matic are already proven high-quality holding midfielders. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic has been one of the most dynamic young goalscoring midfielders in Europe, and Dusan Tadic was unplayable at times during World Cup qualification. Oskar The mood is... one of excitement. There is a real buzz among Switzerland fans. The dream is to reach the quarter-finals for only the fourth time. In the last two international tournaments we were agonisingly knocked out at the second round stage after an 118th-minute goal and a penalty shootout. This time we may have to overcome Germany in the first knockout stage, but we could do that on our day.My favourite player is... Xherdan Shaqiri. He grabbed a hat-trick at the last World Cup against Honduras and scored the goal of Euro 2016. Youngsters such as Manuel Akanji, Steven Zuber and Breel Embolo are continuing to show their promise as well. Nischal Schwager-PatelGermany’s problem in Euro 2016 was... the lack of cutting edge up front. Julian Draxler and Thomas Müller are too slow against faster full-backs. I’m hoping Timo Werner can step into Miroslav Klose’s shoes up front. Germany’s midfield and defence will continue to dominate possession and wear down opponents.If Germany play to their potential, they will... win the World Cup. France and Spain have a crazy amount of talent but Die Mannschaft will be tough to beat. The impact players to watch will be... Leon Goretzka, Timo Werner, Joshua Kimmich and Niklas Sule. I’m excited to see how the Bayern Munich players will gel with the other players. I would also love to be proved wrong about Marco Reus and see him emerge as the world class forward so many people claim he is. Gina MayaThe main concern for Mexico is... the coach. People are optimistic about us making it further than our usual second-round exit but Juan Carlos Osorio may cause us to fail miserably.Brazil 2014 was... a very good tournament for us. We were minutes away from beating the Netherlands in the knockout stages. Our main hope this time is PSV winger Hirving Lozano. I’m excited to see how this young talent will make a mark on the tournament. Joaquín SánchezPeople were far from optimistic...when we ended up in the same qualifying group as France and the Netherlands. It was nearly impossible to think we’d be going to Russia. Most of our experienced players retiring after Euro 2016 also darkened the mood. But a younger generation of players have performed above expectations and here we are.Our coach Jan Andersson has proved... a team without stars can still make a great impact. Former coach Erik Hamren centred Sweden’s whole gameplan around Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Andersson has been a lot braver and has been justly rewarded.We should... progress from the group with Germany. South Korea and Mexico should not be underestimated, but if we perform like we did in qualifying this could be a very memorable tournament.Look out for... Emil Forsberg and Victor Lindelof. An injury-free Forsberg is as close as we have to a superstar. He is expected to pull the strings in the final third. Lindelof may have had some difficulties adapting to the Premier League with Manchester United, but he is still young. In the national team he has captain Andreas Granqvist at the back to guide him. Morris AnderssonSouth Korea fans are... not very optimistic. We are in a tough group and are fearing the worst after the national team made hard work of qualifying. The country will be behind them, but they do not expect much. There is a lot of pressure on... Son Heung-min. Off the scale performances will be required from him. No one else can be relied upon to score the goals needed.My favourite World Cup memories revolve around... Park Ji Sung. I still remember the mood of the nation when his goal eliminated Portugal and sent South Korea through to the knockout stages in 2002. Jevon RyanWe have yet to see the best of our... golden generation. We have a number of great players who are hitting their peak at club level, but they have not yet convinced for the national team.I still have doubts over... Roberto Martínez. The coach hasn’t proved anything yet and has caused quite a stir by leaving one of our best players, Radja Nainggolan, at home.I hope we can make it past the... quarter-finals. It will be hard if we come up against Germany or Brazil. I also expect most of our injury-prone defenders such as Vincent Kompany, Thomas Vermaelen and Toby Alderweireld to have limped off by then. Our most enjoyable player is... Eden Hazard. I hope he has an inspired tournament and gets the best out of Michy Batshuayi up front. Joren PelfreneThe mood is... one of tired resignation. The realignment of English footballing ambition since the golden generation has been slow and pretty painful. The way we massively underestimated a passionate and well drilled Iceland team at Euro 2016 showed we hadn’t quite lost our flair for hubris just yet.My main hopes rest on... Gareth Southgate. He hasn’t seemed overawed yet and we have a bunch of exciting young players. With expectations curbed slightly, this might be the time for us to take our cue from other minnows in the competition and enjoy the ride whatever happens.The player I expect to shine is... Marcus Rashford. He’s going to be fresher than some of the others in the squad after José Mourinho’s man management last season. Raheem Sterling, Kyle Walker and John Stones should benefit from having been part of a Manchester City team that has enough confidence to take on the entire world – which is exactly what they will be doing in Russia. Jack RoeOur first World Cup qualification was... not for the faint-hearted. The last-minute goal that sent us to Russia at the expense of USA was just the last of many nervy moments in a hard-fought group. But it’s been like a carnival celebration ever since.Our expectations are... grounded. We’re conscious about the level of the other teams, but hope to show the world the qualities that got us here: intensity, rhythm and unity.We’ll be the team most likely to... finish games with 10 or nine men. Discipline is our biggest challenge and has been a contributing factor in our previous failures. The soul of our team is... Our captain Roman Torres. He is our leader. I also expect good performances from veterans Blas Perez and Gabriel Torres. Football in Panama is... not the main sport in the country, especially when I grew up. Baseball was and still is the crowd favourite.Getting through the group stages would... extend the carnival celebrations by another couple of months. Amir SanchezThe country is buzzing to have... reached our first finals since 2006. We were so disappointing 12 years ago, despite nearly getting something against Spain. One point against Saudi Arabia and Ukraine sealed our fate before the party had really started. We are... among the weaker nations in Russia. But, while we’re in a tough group, I know we can turn a few heads. I hope we can hold our heads high after the three group games and somehow manage to upset Belgium’s golden generation. Look out for... Naim Sliti, an attacking midfielder who should keep us ticking. Kerym BaccoucheMy favourite thing about Colombia is... the warmth of the people. People genuinely seem to care for you, despite the great difficulties the country is facing. We’re passionate and sometimes a bit overdramatic, but still fun!My first World Cup memory is all about... Carlos Valderrama. His goal against the UAE in Italia 90 meant we could celebrate our first ever World Cup victory. Freddy Rincón’s late equaliser against Germany in the same tournament, which helped us progress through the group, comes a close second.This summer we should... build on the successful 2014 tournament. The majority of the squad from that World Cup is still here and new talents such as Yerry Mina, Davinson Sánchez, José Izquierdo and Mateus Uribe should make us even stronger.I look forward to seeing... James Rodríguez scoring another of the most sublime goals in our short World Cup history. Pedro GalloThe mood is... nothing like the football fever that swept Japan in 1998, when we qualified for the first time. There have been too many setbacks since and people just aren’t that excited this time. The main reasons are Japan coach Vahid Halilhodzic being dismissed right before the tournament and the worrying dwindling popularity of our domestic league.Everything rests on... our match against Colombia on 19 June. The Japanese media expect a positive result will get more people excited about the World Cup.I hope we can... get out of the group. We have an experienced coach in Akira Nishino. He coached Gamba Osaka successfully for many years. We need the communication between the players and the coaching team to be spot on. A strong sense of solidarity is a must if we are to progress. I’m very excited to watch... Takashi Usami. He is becoming a leading midfielder of the national team and learned the ropes under Nishino at Gamba Osaka before moving to Fortuna Düsseldorf. Eiko YoshizumiThe mood in Poland is... quietly expectant. A fine qualifying campaign, backed up by some cleverly scheduled friendlies, ensured we were given a reasonably kind draw. But there’s no point getting carried away. We failed miserably at Euro 2012 when co-hosting, in a group which could not have been weaker.Reaching the knockout stages of Euro 2016... was a massive success. While we lacked a Plan B at times in that tournament, our first XI was a sound mixture of solidity and flair. Question marks hang over the form of key players from that tournament, as well as the suitability of the recently tested formation with three centre-backs. It’s hard not to get excited when... Robert Lewandowski is near a football. With Arek Milik’s injury problems, we’ll need him on top form in Russia. Kuba WitkowskiIn 2002... Senegal carried Africa’s hopes in Japan and South Korea, with all other African nations crashing out at the earliest opportunity. But for poor refereeing decisions, Bruno Metsu’s side would have progressed even further.Sixteen years later... our aim is to progress from the group and pursue the semi-final dream. Why not? Senegal will be one of the hardest working teams in Russia, and the refereeing will hopefully be a lot better than it was in 2002.The player I’m most excited about is... Sadio Mané. After a terrific season with Liverpool it’s time for Mané to shine on the biggest stage of all for his country.

Updated advice from the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) stresses that new mothers should be given appropriate support if they make an informed decision to bottle-feed. The guidance still says babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life, in line with advice from the World Health Organization (WHO).But the RCM has acknowledged that some mothers struggle to start or carry on breastfeeding, and says the decision is a woman’s right. Its chief executive, Gill Walton, said: “Evidence clearly shows that breastfeeding in line with WHO guidance brings optimum benefits for the health of both mother and baby. However, the reality is that often some women for a variety of reasons struggle to start or sustain breastfeeding. “The RCM believes that women should be at the centre of their own care and as with other areas of maternity care, midwives and maternity support workers should promote informed choice. “If, after being given appropriate information, advice and support on breastfeeding, a woman chooses not to do so, or to give formula as well as breastfeeding, her choice must be respected.” The National Childbirth Trust has previously warned that women can face judgment or feel guilty about the decisions they make when it comes to feeding their baby. But the RCM said it recognised that “some women cannot or do not wish to breastfeed”. “They must be given all the advice and support they need on safe preparation of bottles and responsive feeding to develop a close and loving bond with their baby,” Walton added. “We know that every woman wants the best for her baby and we want to be able to empower our members to support women to be the best they can be and enable them to make decisions that are right for themselves and their babies.” The organisation also said that those who chose to breastfeed needed more support and should not feel “guilty or embarrassed” about breastfeeding in public. Research has found breastfeeding can have long-term health advantages, with children less likely to develop diabetes or become obese later in life.

Spoon the hot shallots over the top, then add the parsley and 50g of very finely sliced ham, such as jamon Iberico or San Daniele.The crème fraîche needs to melt and ooze into the potatoes, so dress them quickly, as soon as you have drained and crushed them. If the potatoes have cooled, then melt the crème fraîche in a shallow pan, add the cooked shallots and the parsley, and pour over the potatoes, tossing them gently in the sauce.You can use small carrots for this, crushing them lightly as you would the potatoes, and spooning thick yogurt over the top in place of the crème fraîche.

I find myself hypnotised by the feast of flavours perched in the windows of gelaterias, pondering how many I could realistically fit into one holiday. On a recent trip to Spain, I tried strawberry cheesecake ice-cream and was blown away. After some experimentation back home, I now suspect the Spanish version used actual cheesecake. And although I’m never usually one to shy away from a culinary project, baking up a cheesecake solely for the purpose of using it in ice-cream seems a bit much, even for me – but today’s recipe is close: rich, creamy and bursting with summer flavours.For the shortbread 150g cold salted butter150g plain flour40g icing sugarFor the ice-cream100g double cream200g whole milk4 egg yolks150g caster sugar200g mascarpone1 tsp vanilla extract¼ tsp salt5 tbsp good-quality strawberry jamHeat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4, and put a large bowl in the freezer to chill. Meanwhile, make the shortbread: blitz the butter, flour and sugar in a food processor until the mix looks like fine breadcrumbs. Divide between two rectangular tins, roughly 10cm x 25cm, and press down firmly, then bake for 20 minutes, until golden. Set aside to cool completely.Make the base for the ice-cream: mix the double cream, milk, egg yolks and sugar in a saucepan, and cook over a medium heat. Use a balloon whisk to keep the mix moving constantly, and keep cooking for a few minutes until it thickens. Remove from the hob, stir in the mascarpone, vanilla and salt, and set aside to cool, giving it an occasional stir. Once cooled, put it in the fridge to chill for about two hours.Once chilled, put the mixture in the freezer drum of an ice-cream maker and churn until it starts to freeze. Once the ice-cream has frozen, transfer it to the chilled bowl. Break up half the shortbread into little chunks and stir it into the ice-cream cut the other half into wedges and set aside. Stir the jam into the ice-cream, one spoon at a time, taking care not to overmix it you want to see little ripples of jam throughout the ice-cream. Transfer the whole mix to a tub and pop it in the freezer.If you don’t have an ice-cream maker, pop the fridge-chilled mix into a tub and put it in the freezer. Remove at 25-minute intervals to give it a brief, vigorous stir, until the mix starts to freeze. Then freeze completely.To serve, scoop a portion of ice-cream into a bowl and serve with the shortbread, fresh strawberries and fresh mint leaves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0d1ec5788c10333a3e0e6919e4e87c847f0be06/0_229_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44a5a5ba2d7193021cb32d82a830bcf1","title":"bbc staff accept new pay deal after two years of negotiations","story":"NUJ members vote in favour despite threats from some representatives to resignBBC staff have voted to accept a new pay deal after a hard-fought battle that saw some union representatives threaten to resign in protest at changes to terms and conditions.Union leaders say the deal includes an increase in the BBC minimum salary from £15,687 to £20,000 as of August, increased sick pay and wellbeing arrangements, and a simpler, more transparent pay structure.Messages seen by the , however, show that some representatives of the National Union of Journalists at the corporation had raised concerns with union officials about the deal and the way it was agreed. The proposals were agreed earlier this year following all-night negotiations involving management and three unions at the conciliation service ACAS which lasted for 22 hours.In the lengthy email chains some NUJ representatives threatened to resign if the deal was passed, arguing that union leaders should go back to the negotiating table and demand a more generous package.During the vote the newsroom in the BBC’s New Broadcasting House headquarters was filled with material lobbying against the agreement. Campaigners against the deal anonymously distributed leaflets arguing that the proposed changes would damage the potential future earnings of young staff joining the corporation and offer less certainty for shift workers. The NUJ general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, welcomed the decision to accept the new deal “It’s now time for the BBC’s commitments to better working conditions and greater work-life balance to be put into action,” she said.“The new pay structure still requires collective effort to make it work, but it is a structure that will provide greater transparency and assist in holding the BBC to account on pay parity now and in the future.”Anne Bulford, BBC deputy director-general, said the “simple, fair and consistent proposals” will “benefit staff, the BBC, and most importantly the audiences we serve”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c28f9d5ab388aed4316a7909a17ef87551f21307/395_141_2209_1325/master/2209.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e5ec172da978713667f664033078d27","title":"shakira review o2 arena london","story":"O2 Arena, LondonResurgent after re-embracing Spanish-language pop, the Colombian superstar still gives her all to her anglophone hitsThere is no shortage of alpha women filling the world’s big venues this summer. As Shakira arrives for her first British date since 2010, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry and Beyoncé (performing with Jay-Z) are in the UK this week, and Britney Spears is here in August. Of them all, though, only one gave a speech at the World Economic Forum last year, after receiving an award for her work on early childhood education.That’s not the only thing that distinguishes Shakira from her peers – the singer is a formative figure in the mainstreaming of Latin music, having paved the way for the current ubiquity of Luis Fonsi and her fellow Colombian J Balvin, whose success has, in turn, provided a launchpad for her comeback. Her years away from the live circuit have been consumed by child-rearing and relocation to Barcelona, the hometown of her partner, footballer Gerard Piqué. (Tonight, she turns her guitar to display a picture of Piqué and their children on the back – the pop equivalent of pulling photos out of her handbag.) A self-titled English-language album reached No 2 in the US in 2014 despite not being supported by a tour, but it was 2017’s mainly Spanish record El Dorado that marked the real start of her return.She can still fill arenas, although much of tonight’s crowd seem to be drawn from south London’s Colombian population, who vociferously welcome back-catalogue hits such as La Tortura and ¿Dónde Estás Corazón?. The setlist skews Spanish, and wisely so, given the reaction to songs such as Me Enamoré and her recent venture into reggaeton, Chantaje. If anything, English-language hits such as Hips Don’t Lie and her 2014 duet with Rihanna, Can’t Remember to Forget You, don’t excite quite the same joy and waving of Colombian flags as, say, the sentimental Antologia and Tú.Therein lies the question hovering over the El Dorado tour: can she emphasise her Latin identity by hitching herself to reggaeton and retain the English speakers who came aboard during the era of big pop hits like Hips Don’t Lie and She Wolf? Shakira certainly has a good go at it here. Her last major pop song was her Rihanna duet (which gets a novel twist tonight, with Shakira playing drums as footage of Rihanna appears on video screens), so the tour lacks the white heat that surrounds an artist on a hot streak, yet the set bubbles away at a tremendous pace.It’s apt that the second song tonight, She Wolf, begins with her straining against chains that shackle her wrists before bursting free – Shakira, fearless and frothy-maned, is positively lupine in her power and litheness. One moment she’s acting out standard arena rituals (asking the girls in the house to howl She Wolf’s chorus, demanding that the crowd roar the word “chantaje”) and the next she’s reinforcing her links to Colombia with a video depicting the mother goddess Bachué. Belly dancing, long a feature of her shows, is a tribute to her father’s Lebanese heritage, and an especially limber one at that, complete with gold death mask on the back of her head.“A few months ago, I didn’t think I’d ever play for you again,” she says, alluding to a vocal cord haemorrhage that forced the postponement of the tour’s opening dates. “But miracles do exist.”Long may she howl."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73ba7b16c26031756cdee5cd287e44d93f086a31/0_347_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fba4d6b2d9c6d192b39d641190b46dd","title":"the last bat the mystery of britains most solitary animal","story":"In a dank Sussex tunnel, a solitary greater mouse-eared bat roosts each winter. Is he the only one left in Britain? By  Patrick BarkhamWe cannot speak of its loneliness, but it must be Britain’s most solitary animal. For the last 16 years, every winter, a male greater mouse-eared bat has taken up residence 300 metres inside a disused and exceedingly damp railway tunnel in West Sussex. The greater mouse-eared bat has been all but extinct in this country for decades. This is the only remaining one we know of. The future of the species in Britain appears to rest with one long-lived and very distinctive inidual.The greater mouse-eared bat is so large that observers who first discovered it in Britain likened one to a young rabbit hanging from a wall. In flight, its wings can stretch to nearly half a metre – an astonishing spectacle in a land where bats are generally closer to the size of the rodent that inspired their old name: flittermouse.The bat has large, mouse-like ears and its feeding habits are as striking as its size. Rather than zig-zagging through darkening skies collecting flying insects, like most bats, Myotis myotis descends earthwards, flapping its wings very slowly as it covers the ground, picking up grasshoppers, crickets, dung beetles and other flightless insects as it goes. Often, it will flop on to the ground, wings outstretched to fold over its prey.The solitary inidual who spends the winters in West Sussex has never been observed in flight. Where it goes each spring is not known, and what it does is not known, nor which other animals, if any, it encounters. All that is known is that each winter the bat faithfully returns to its dark tunnel, where it hangs, almost motionless, for five months. This place of winter rest is a closely guarded secret, for the bat’s select band of self-appointed s are adamant: there can be no repeat of the scenes of 1957. That year, a live colony had been found inside an old mine on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset. Although a reasonably familiar sight in southern Europe, where large colonies roost in caves, this was the first time a greater mouse-eared bat had been found in Britain. The Times published photographs, and a media frenzy ensued. Several animals were whisked out of hibernation and transported to TV and photographic studios and filmed for weeks before being returned to their hibernation hole. Disturbing bats mid-hibernation can kill them. Money was also offered for dead specimens and collectors spirited iniduals away.This fascination was fatal: the greater mouse-eared bat was barely seen again in Dorset, apart from reports of “very large, broad-winged bats” in an appropriately gothic setting: flying around Corfe Castle. Although another small colony of greater mouse-eared bats was found in West Sussex in the late 1960s, by 1992 the species was declared extinct in Britain, the first mammal to disappear from our shores since the wolf 250 years ago.Bats fly beneath our radar. While butterfly sightings have been collected for 400 years and birds have been scientifically monitored for more than 70 years, bats only been systematically counted for less than two decades. Little is known about many of Britain’s 18 bat species, some of which exist in perilously low numbers. Today they are threatened perhaps more than they’ve ever been by the loss of their insect prey, the conversion of old barns and derelict buildings in which they roost, and the bright lights of new suburbs, wind farms and speeding vehicles that bamboozle or kill them.The unexpected reappearance of the greater mouse-eared bat in its West Sussex tunnel, in 2002, was a symbol of hope. Against the odds, bats are surviving in our human-dominated land and, perhaps more than any other wild animal, they are constantly surprising us.Bats are great survivors. The oldest known fossil of a bat, found in a quarry in Wyoming in 2003, is about 52.5m years old. Bats have been evolving for so long, and with so many specialised attributes, from echolocation to drastically extended forelimbs, that the order of Chiroptera – “winged hands” in Latin – accounts for one in five species of mammal. They are supremely successful animals. As one expert puts it: when you have been evolving for so long, you’ve perfected the business of being a bat.That business is becoming tricker in a human-dominated world. In older times, they were feared and despised. Modern people may be more tolerant, but even beneficent parts of society – from harvesters of renewable energy to vicars – are often hostile to bats. Energy-efficient homes seal up roof spaces where bats once roosted. New roads – and the planned route of the HS2 railway – block traditional foraging routes. LED lighting is particularly disturbing for bats. Wind farms chop them up: according to a study published in 2016, researchers using sniffer dogs to find and retrieve bat carcasses calculated that 29 onshore windfarms killed 194 dead bats per month – a kill-rate that would dispatch 80,000 bats a year across Britain, without accounting for migrating bats taken out by the rapidly expanding rows of offshore turbines.Earlier this year, members of the House of Lords spoke in favour of a bill that seeks to remove bats’ legal protection in churches unless there is a “significant” adverse impact on rare bat populations. The Bishop of Norwich blamed barn conversions for driving bats into churches, with more than half of 12,000 listed churches housing roosts of bats. Worshippers had “come to the end of their tether,” warned the bishop, because of bat droppings despoiling brasses, fabrics and fittings. For much of the 1990s and early 2000s, the Movement Against Bats in Churches – founded by a vicar’s wife – campaigned to eliminate the blight of bats. Is there another animal in Britain that has a dedicated protest movement against it?Bats that overcome these challenges can live a long time. Only 19 mammal species are longer-lived relative to their body size than humans, and all but one of these are bats. (The other is the naked mole rat.) And of these unusually durable mammals, the greater mouse-eared bat is one of the longest-lived of all: it can clock up more than 35 years. Scientists recently discovered that its longevity is probably due to the fact that, unlike most mammals, its telomeres – a string-like material at the end of its chromosomes – do not shorten with age. They hope further insights from the unique biology of Myotis myotis may one day help humans live longer.Time passes in a different way for such a long-lived animal, and so it seems with its s. I first contacted natural scientist and bat expert Tony Hutson in early 2017, and it was more than a year before he agreed to take me to see the bat. Hutson, a retired entomologist from the Natural History Museum, is wary of any interference in the creature’s peaceful existence. Each month of winter, Hutson and other local recorders count the bats hibernating in several old railway tunnels, and each month I begged to be allowed to tag along. After the bat was inspected without me in December, January and February, finally Hutson agreed that I could accompany them on an extra trip they would undertake in March, with a big caveat: they didn’t normally inspect the bat so late in winter, and could not guarantee it would still be hanging there.Hutson is the second in a short lineage of champions of the greater mouse-eared bat. The first was a wildlife-loving tea-planter from Ceylon called Captain William Watt Addison Phillips. Phillips grew up in Staffordshire during the reign of Queen Victoria, and headed to Colombo to become a tea-planter when he was 19. Living among the civets, leopards and sloth bears of Ceylon, he catalogued its natural history and published papers including “On the habits of the Ceylon Gerbil”.After retiring, Phillips conducted a survey of the flora and fauna of the Males for the Natural History Museum before settling in Bognor Regis in 1959, just after the first greater mouse-eared bat frenzy. Phillips remained active and insatiably curious in retirement, taking an interest in every kind of animal and plant around him. He was also lucky: one day he found a grey long-eared bat – Britain’s second-rarest species – sprawled on his dustbin. It was dead. Some years later, Phillips explored some derelict railway tunnels in Sussex with his grandson. In one, they were delighted to discover a small colony of greater mouse-eared bats. Bearing in mind the old shooting aficionado’s adage, “What hits is history, what’s missed is mystery,” Phillips shouldered his gun, brought down a couple and donated the specimens to the eager curators of the Natural History Museum, who added them to their collections.At the time, Tony Hutson was working as a scientific researcher in the museum and, by chance, had already met Bill Phillips a few years earlier, during an expedition to the Males. Hutson had first become fascinated by bats as a boy, when he saw them above an old priory. He was particularly gripped when he first witnessed the mystery of their motionless hibernation. “That got me – that they will sit there without moving for three or four months,” he says. “How are they doing nothing?” Growing up in south London, he joined a natural history youth group that met at the Natural History Museum as a young man, he applied for a job there. He had a cup of tea with a secretary and asked if he could help its scientists who were studying bats. “They said: ‘No, but we can give you a job in entomology.’” So Hutson cunningly pursued his passion by studying the ectoparasites – such as fleas – that live on bats.As one of the museum’s bat experts, Hutson spent much of his time coaxing irate homeowners not to destroy colonies of rare bats roosting in their roofs. But there were moments of adventure, too. He undertook an expedition to a cave in Ecuador with Erich von Däniken, the Swiss author of Chariots of the Gods, who believed that aliens visited Earth and influenced early human culture. The explorers were winched into the cave by helicopter and the astronaut Neil Armstrong came along. “The theory was that if we did meet any aliens, he would be the best person for them to talk to,” said Hutson. He found no aliens, but they did come across a few interesting bat species.After taking note of Bill Phillips’ surprising discovery of a colony of greater mouse-eared bats in Sussex, Hutson first visited the old railway tunnels in 1974, and saw the bats for himself. “I was working with ectoparasites of bats at the time, so I’d sometimes come down and poke a few around, searching for parasites,” he said. The tunnel was bricked up, with a locked door at one end, to stop visitors from causing a repeat of the scenes that destroyed the Dorset population in the 1950s. (The bats gained access via ventilation grills.) Each year in the 1980s, Hutson unlocked the door and counted the greater mouse-eared bats inside. Each year, their numbers dwindled. The Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 gave bats and their roosts legal protection for the first time, but then, disaster: one winter, all the female greater mouse-eared bats disappeared from the tunnel. It seemed that their maternity roost – the barn or some other unknown place in Britain where the females raised their young during the summer – must have been destroyed, perhaps in a fire, or by developers. By 1992, the greater mouse-eared bat was declared extinct.But Tony Hutson did not give up. Each winter, he continued to check tunnels and disused mines all over the south of England. Nine years later, his vigilance was vindicated. He heard reports of a live bat found, grounded, in Bognor, and raced to the seaside town. By the time he arrived, this old female bat had died. And it presented another puzzle: it was disabled.“A bat’s forearms are usually the same length, but on this bat they were different lengths,” he remembered. “Whether it spent its life flying around in circles, I’m not sure.” Was there a secret, residual population of mouse-eared bats? It appeared not, for this venerable female showed no sign of ever having bred, and no sign of having communed with any other mouse-eared bats. “There were no parasites on it that it would have picked up from others of its kind, which is what I was looking for,” said Hutson. But the find put him on high alert.At the end of 2002, his annual inspection of the old tunnel where the bats had been found by Captain Bill Phillips in the 1960s revealed a single greater mouse-eared bat. It was a young male, born that spring. Hutson and the protectors placed a silver tag on its elbow and wondered how this species would surprise them next.By March, I was desperate to see this bat. I met Hutson on a murky day in a layby close to the secret tunnel. He had been visiting the bat each month over winter, but offered no crumb of comfort. “Whether he flew off last night, I don’t know,” he said with a twitch of deadpan humour. We set off through a woodland with some fellow bat enthusiasts: Crispin Scott of the National Trust, and Sue Harris and Martin Phillis, volunteer bat recorders for Sussex bat group and part of a network of bat fans who form the Bat Conservation Trust. This small charity is the national voice for bats in Britain, and Hutson revealed, with characteristic modesty, that he helped set it up.We walked down the cutting of an old railway line, sharp lumps of chalk and fallen trees tumbling down the banks. The tiniest trace of people having walked along the cutting worried the protectors. “It’s too open,” said Scott. “We need to fell a couple of trees across here so only people in the know come down.” At the end was a tunnel of red brick, marching into the hillside.At the centre of its bricked-up entrance was an iron hatch. Phillis pulled out a key, unlocked the top and the bottom, and we squeezed inside. The tunnel was cool but not freezing dark but not pitch-black. Daylight shone from the grille above our heads and in the far distance, like a mirage, was a crescent of light, another grille, 680 metres away, at the tunnel’s end.I hadn’t anticipated the water. There was the sound of constant dripping as water oozed through the brick ceiling and hit the stony floor. The bricks glistened with moisture. “Bats need it very humid,” said Hutson. “If it gets too dry, they dehydrate.” There were black stains on curved tunnel walls and ceiling. Only when we later emerged and discovered our faces were streaked with black did I realise that this was archeological soot, from the steam trains that last entered this tunnel in the 1950s.The bat protectors wielded head and hand torches and began by painstakingly sweeping their beams up and down the curved walls of the tunnel, inspecting ginger-coloured fungi, straggly like beards, and searching for the bats that clung in crevices where mortar or brickwork had come away. Different species shared this tunnel. Smaller species may temporarily wake from hibernation to pee or feed if it is mild, but the greater mouse-eared goes deeper into the tunnel and remains motionless for longer. Hutson pointed out the different species, with their distinctive features. The natterer’s bat has long, trumpety ears and a Daz-white belly Daubenton’s bat has big feet, which it uses to grab insects off the surface of ponds. These bats are counted three times each winter for Bat Conservation Trust hibernation surveys.We probably didn’t need to, but we talked in low murmurs. I walked past the bats’ somnolent bodies with the same care I take while tiptoeing into my children’s bedroom when they are sleeping.The first question Hutson asked when he found the mouse-eared bat in 2002 was: where did it go after its winter hibernation? Answer this question, and he might find other members of its tribe. Hutson contacted colleagues in Portugal who better knew its lifestyle and were familiar with its preferred summer habitats. “We organised a big survey, well sort of,” he said. “We met in the pub and looked at prime local habitat. It was a time when they were cutting a lot of hay and these bats often go for freshly cut hay, where they can find more insects.”During summer, the greater mouse-eared bat roosts high in church and castle turrets in northern Europe, and in caves in the south. Hutson looked in old sand and chalk mines, and in disused lime kilns. He asked industrial archeologists and consulted other societies for secretive enthusiasts. “There’s always some nut looking for holes in the ground,” he said. “We combed the region for suitable sites.” The bat group appealed to the media, encouraging people to look for big bats. They collected a hair sample to use DNA to identify its origin, but the lab scientists weren’t able to extract DNA at the time.The broadcaster and naturalist Chris Packham came to film the hunt. But there was no trace of the bat or any of its kin. The bat did turn up at the Sussex tunnel the next winter, however, and the winter after that. Hutson considered putting a VHS radio tag on the bat, but was worried that the burden of a tag could kill it, and he would be blamed. “What put me off in the end was if it didn’t turn up again that winter, I’d be drummed out of the country,” he said. In 2007, however, the protectors plucked up the courage to carefully take the bat off the tunnel wall during its hibernation and inspect it. Its teeth were a bit worn, but it was in good health – and very alone. During his inspection of its private parts, Hutson found signs that it had never been sexually active.We were now 300 metres inside the tunnel. A natterer’s was stuffed into a crevice no wider than a centimetre. “He’s awake, isn’t he?” said Hutson, swiftly moving his torch away so as not to disturb it. Then he pointed his torch towards a bat that was noticeably larger than the others: solid, and tea-cup sized. “A very rare bat,” he said, “but not rare enough for you.” A Bechstein’s bat.What of the mouse-eared bat? “He has definitely moved,” said Sue Harris, who had noted his position during their previous inspection, in February. We were in the relatively warm middle of the tunnel, where it was 8.2C, but there was no bat. Harris walked ahead. Suddenly, her methodical movements became frantic. “I can hardly contain my excitement,” she called out.High up, where a whole brick had fallen from the curve of the tunnel wall, hung a large, sandy-coloured bat. A silver ring wrapped around its forearm shone in our torchlight. The greater mouse-eared bat. The natterer’s bats we had seen weighed 8g. This one weighed more than 30g, with a broad pink muzzle, a long, pale underside, and dark-brown wings folded up tight by its side like an umbrella.It would be hard to bond with a creature you only ever saw perfectly still, in a deep sleep, face averted from the world. Was Hutson fond of it? “I shall be sorry when it’s not there, assuming I outlive it,” he said. “You never know – it might have another 20 years to go. It might be having an easy time, no stresses. It looks quite tough, sort of robust.” But Harris was worried. “He’s looking damp, especially around the neck area. He didn’t look at all damp in February,” she said. Droplets of water glistened silver on his fur. His ring looked tarnished.The bat’s unknowability was frustrating but, after 16 years, Hutson had become resigned to the unanswered questions about this inidual, and the fate of the species in Britain. Where does this bat go? Perhaps to France? Are there really no others? “After a few years I wondered if we should have done more in terms of finding others,” said Hutson, “but now I’m convinced it is a loner and whatever we had done wouldn’t have made a difference.” Could they reintroduce the species using wild specimens caught in continental Europe? “The first problem is that they would have to go into quarantine for at least six months because of rabies. After being in captivity for six months they wouldn’t be too good at operating in the wild.”We reached the end of the tunnel. There was no exit, just a solid wall of breezeblocks. The bat seemed less a pioneer, the first of its kind, than a survivor, the last of its kind – like the tunnel, a dead-end.If there really is only one greater mouse-eared bat in Britain, with no possibility of reproduction, then it is as good as extinct. Seven other British bat species exist in such low numbers that no reliable population data exists. But technology such as bat detectors, which reveal bats by the sound of their echolocation, is helping better monitor populations. The Bat Conservation Trust’s systematic monitoring of 10 species since the start of this century has revealed an unexpected picture: nine of these appear to be increasing in number. If true, it is yet another way in which bats have surprised us.But counting bats accurately is difficult, said Mathews. They are usually counted where they are known to roost, but scientists have yet to work out a way of counting the number of roosts in an area. “Unless we know that, it makes it very, very difficult to understand what is going on with the population,” she said. Current threats to bats seem to spring from misunderstanding of both human and bat nature. Today, every bat and every roosting site in the EU is protected by the EU Habitats Directive. But legal protection infuriates many home-owners and developers, and may encourage the furtive destruction of bat colonies.Environmental legislation usually follows a “polluter pays” principle, but with bats, the person providing a home for bats is penalised, and must meet all the expense of surveying and providing alternative sites. The government is promising that after Brexit, public money for farmers will be based on the services they provide for the ecosystem (clean water, fertile soils etc). Mathews wondered whether a similar formula could be applied to homeowners who provide bat services.“You can understand why people find it frustrating when they want to convert their barn and it’s got bats in it and it’s a complete palaver,” she said. “Whoever has a bat roost is providing a service to the rest of the community, so there should be a community effort to make sure the bats are protected.”The second challenge for bats is another visible sign of society’s supposed care for them: the bat bridges that  new roads. These trellises of wires hung between telegraph poles either side of the carriageway are designed to funnel bats up and safely over fast-moving traffic so they are not killed by cars and lorries when they follow their traditional foraging routes across new roads. Unfortunately, they don’t work: bats are still killed by moving vehicles. And there is no funding to monitor how bats use these bridges, if at all, or to test whether there may be a design that does work.Despite the roads, the regulations, the wind turbines and the barn conversions, Mathews feels there are grounds for optimism for Britain’s rarest bat. The greater mouse-eared bat may have dipped in and out of extinction in Britain, but after decades of decline in northern Europe, the species is on the rise again in countries such as Austria. She believes it might be possible to find out more about the lonely bat’s mysterious life. “My first question was: why don’t we put a GPS tag on it?” she said. “It’s already 16. It’s now or never. We don’t want to intervene and hasten the demise of this animal – it’s that burden of responsibility – , but on the other hand, it does seem a rather wasted opportunity not to find out anything else about it. If it had been me, I would’ve been blitzing the place looking for evidence of greater mouse-eared bats, and I don’t think anybody has.” A new scientific review of British mammal populations states that it is “plausible” that other iniduals are present, and could be revealed by exhaustive searches of potential summer roosting locations, or sites where they “swarm” in autumn.Mathews will start doing just that this summer, putting out special nets – such as a harp trap, a large frame with strings between it which cause a bat to drop unharmed into a collection chamber below. “The same species on the continent is often found in churches and castles and big buildings. We could start looking at these sorts of places. We could also do DNA analysis of historic droppings. Perhaps it does go to France every summer and comes back? Surely it won’t be the only one doing that? We could do some more work in the autumn, when these bats exhibit swarming behaviour. If there are others in the area that happen not to hibernate in the tunnel, it’s possible they may turn up at that time of year.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d3a34e2329975bff4054900cdbb32d7dcb518d2/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ff6d606d83393dec2de3599b4fd52846 960w","title":"arron banks tells mps i have no business interests in russia","story":"Brexiter questioned about where his £9m of backing for leave campaign came fromArron Banks has told MPs he thought it would be worthwhile meeting a Russian businessman fronting a goldmining deal, at the suggestion of the country’s ambassador to the UK, but pulled out after being warned not to become more deeply involved.Banks told the digital, culture, media and sport select committee he reasoned it was worth attending the initial meeting with Siman Povarenkin, but was then advised to “be circumspect” about further involvement by the former chief of the general staff Lord Guthrie and the businessman Peter Hambro. “I met with him, I’m a businessman, why shouldn’t I? I thought it was interesting,” Banks said. After the warnings, he added, the deal fell away. “I have no business in Russia, I have done no business deals in Russia.”Questions about the Brexit donor’s engagement with the deal came towards the end of a three-hour hearing. Banks eventually walked out of the hearing, refusing to answer five more minutes of questions because he had a lunch with the Democratic Unionist party MPs Ian Paisley Jr and Sammy Wilson and had previously been told the proceedings were close to a conclusion.MPs repeatedly questioned Banks about the sources of his wealth, prompting the insurance entrepreneur to deny that any of it came from Russia. Banks, appearing alongside the Leave.EU communications director, Andy Wigmore, also denied visiting Russia in February 2016 to progress the mining deal, and he presented the committee with copies of both of his passports, which he said showed there was no visa stamp around that date. The two witnesses said that when Wigmore had emailed a journalist at the time to suggest Banks was in Russia and unavailable, he was being mischievous and lying.At another point, Banks said it was not uncommon for he and Wigmore to exaggerate to try to gain an advantage with plausible stories. “We certainly weren’t afraid of leading journalists up the country path, the same with politicians,” he said. “Journalists are the cleverest, stupidest people on earth. They are clever, but they want to believe some of this stuff.”After the hearing, the committee chairman, Damian Collins, said: “Banks and Wigmore themselves put on the record that they frequently lie, exaggerate, misspeak and misunderstand. So it is difficult for the committee to know if we should take all of their answers seriously when it comes to data sharing and misuse, campaign spending, and their meetings with high-ranking Russian officials.”The suggestion that Banks meet Povarenkin followed a meeting with Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, in November 2015. Banks told MPs he went to meet him because he had been invited at the prompting of Wigmore, who also acted as a trade envoy for Belize.Giles Watling, a Conservative MP on the committee, asked Banks: “I’d like to move on to big, scary Russia. I get the point that if the Russian ambassador asks you round for a drink you go, but this relationship went on for quite some time. What were you hoping to get out of it?” Banks initially replied: “A good lunch, and that’s what I got.” This prompted Watling to ask if there were in fact “many good lunches”, to which Banks said: “Many good lunches.” The businessman was attending the hearing in the aftermath of the leak of a cache of emails belonging to him, Wigmore and others, which suggested his dealings with Russia were far more extensive than previously thought. He had previously said in the book The Bad Boys of Brexit that he attended one “six-hour boozy lunch” with the Russian ambassador in November 2015, several months before the Brexit vote, at which they drank vodka supposedly distilled for Joseph Stalin. Banks and Wigmore also told MPs they had passed a phone number for the Trump transition team to Yakovenko at another lunch they had with him in November 2016, a few days after their visit to Trump Tower when they met the then president-elect after waiting in the building for six hours. “What’s wrong with that? We gave them a telephone number,” Banks said.He said he asked her “what if somebody wants to get in touch with you?” and she replied: “Here’s a number, you can give them that.”Earlier it emerged Banks had lodged an appeal against the Electoral Commission over its decision to fine Leave.EU £70,000 for breaching spending limits. Collins told the committee that as a result it would not be possible for the MPs to explore related areas. The commission is also conducting a separate inquiry into the “true source” of Banks’ loans and donations to Leave.EU and Ukip, which amount to at least £9m.  The hearing began with an attempt by the two men to unbalance Collins by pointing out that according to the register of members’ interests he had received hospitality and two tickets from Roman Abramovich’s Chelsea to watch a game against Crystal Palace. “In the light of hospitality from Putin’s No 1 man in London, you might recuse yourself,” Wigmore said.Collins told the witnesses it was a “nice try” but that although he had watched the match he had not met Abramovich. He went on to say he “wasn’t offered Stalin’s vodka” and had “no shares in goldmines”, and in response to a suggestion from Banks he added that there were “no honey traps”. The Conservative MP said: “Chelsea won 2-1, that was the extent of the entertainment.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/076b20a4fd3a296edb29f949a88a096ed737e6ad/0_131_3435_2061/master/3435.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6d4d059d5761438896b60637be1529c","title":"brexit no 10 rejects last minute meaningful vote compromise ahead of key vote politics live","story":"MPs are voting on Lords amendments to EU withdrawal billThe government has defeated the final group of Lords amendments, by 321 votes to 40 - a majority of 281. The SNP voted against, but Labour abstained.In a point of order Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, says Labour has let down the people of Scotland.The Labour MP for Edinburgh South, Ian Murray, uses Twitter to justify Labour’s stance.Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, also rises to make a point of order. She says the way the government is applying the Sewel convention undermines Wales.Dominic Grieve told the Press Association that his amendment today was not about facilitating a second referendum. He said:I think a second referendum is a wholly separate issue. If the public change their mind on Brexit, then my judgment has always been that parliament needs to consider that. Some of my colleagues don’t agree.This debate in parliament today is not about second referendums, it is about trying to manage what is an extremely risky and complex process as well as possible.MPs are now voting on remaining Lords amendments.Lidington says the government agrees with the spirit of the amendment proposed by Chris Patten in the Lords (one of 15 amendments on which the government was defeated). But it is proposing amendments to tidy this up, he says.John Bercow, the speaker, interrupts. Time is up for the debate.Bercow asks MPs to approve government amendments to the Patten amendment. They go through on the nod, and then the Patten amendment, as amended, goes through unopposed.The Conservative MP Heidi Allen, who was one of the Tory MPs who rebelled over Dominic Grieve’s “meaningful vote” amendment in December, has said she abstained tonight because she was assured the government would accept parts 5A and 5B from the new Grieve amendment.Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the UK government is legislating on matters that are devolved. He asks for an assurance that Westminster will not do that without a legislative consent motion.Lidington says the Welsh government accepts that Westminster is honouring its obligations to devolutions. And he says the UK is honouring the Sewel convention (which says the UK government should not legislate for matters that are normally devolved without the approval of the devolved legislature). Lidington says the Scottish government’s Brexit minister, Mike Russell, has admitted that these are not normal circumstances.Lidington is still speaking in the debate. He says the Welsh government has agreed to what the UK government is proposing for powers being repatriated from the EU relating to matters normally devolved. The Scottish government has not accepted the government’s plans, but Lidington says the UK government has engaged constructively on this issue.You can read the voting lists for the “meaningful vote” ision here.MPs are now starting the debate on the second set of amendments being considered today. But because the programme motion has set aside just six hours for debate, and because the voting has taken so long, there are only about 15 minutes set aside for debate.David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, opens the debate. These amendments cover devolution issues, he says.The SNP’s Pete Wishart says the government should be ashamed of how little time has been set aside for this debate. (Wishart has every right to complain. The government tabled some substantial amendments when the EU withdrawal bill was in the Lords relating to devolved powers. But the SNP are not represented in the House of Lords, and so the SNP have not had a parliamentary say on these matters.)And the government won the the 11th and final vote in this round of voting, by 321 votes to 305 - a majority of 16. MPs voted to take out a Lords amendment requiring the government to seek parliamentary approval for phase two of the Brexit talks.The government won vote number 10, another one removing a Lords amendment saying ministers could only pass secondary legislation when “necessary”, and not just when “appropriate”. Ministers won by 317 votes to 306 - a majority of 11 (the lowest of the night).These are from Alex Wickham, who works for the pro-Brexit Guido Fawkes website.According to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, government sources are not reading quite as much into the concession as Tory pro-Europeans like Dominic Grieve (see 6.07pm) or Phillip Lee (see 5.55pm.)There could be at least four explanations for the briefing discrepancy.1) Different parts of the government machine are giving out different messages.2) The government is pulling back a bit, under pressure from Brexiters.3) The Tory “rebels” read rather too much into what May and others in government were telling them.4) The “rebels” are deliberately talking up what they think they secured from May to make it harder for her to back down.It is quite possible that there is an element of all four in the mix.Here is some more comment from journalists on the significance (or otherwise) of the government’s “meaningful vote” concession.From the Sun’s Tom Newton DunnFrom the Economist’s John PeetFrom the ’s James Rothwell"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb9af07538644ec405d19b12db729cc587294d72/0_52_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4575c410f8f0f53f3441c8fc53a84746","title":"government relax immigration rules overseas doctors","story":"May heeds pleas from cabinet colleague to scrap ‘absolutely barmy’ caps on staffThousands more overseas doctors will be able to come and work in the NHS after Theresa May heeded pleas from cabinet colleagues to scrap limits that hospital bosses had criticised as “absolutely barmy”.The relaxation of immigration rules, which is due to be announced imminently, represents a victory for Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid and follows a vociferous campaign by NHS organisations and medical groups.They have been arguing that medics should be taken out of the cap on skilled workers allowed to work in Britain, in order to help tackle the NHS’s deepening workforce crisis. Hunt, the health and social care secretary, and Javid, the home secretary, have been privately lobbying the prime minister to ease restrictions that between November and April denied more than 2,300 doctors from outside the European Economic Area the chance to work in the NHS.Under the current immigration system the number of non-EEA skilled workers of all sorts able to come and work in Britain on a tier-2 visa through a certificate of sponsorship is capped at 20,700 a year – a ceiling set by the Home Office. However, the government has decided that the NHS’s need for more doctors is so great that they should be treated differently, well-placed sources have told the . The rethink should mean that doctors are no longer left unable to take up job offers from hospitals and GP surgeries because they cannot get a visa. There will now be a separate system to decide which medics come. Recent official figures show that the NHS in England alone is short of 9,982 doctors. Those refused tier-2 visas in recent months have included GPs, psychiatrists and cancer specialists, all of which have a significant number of vacancies. Hospitals have said their inability to recruit doctors from outside the EEA would lead to patients facing longer waiting times for treatment and hit patient safety. Andrew Foster, chief executive of the Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS hospital trust recently condemned the “bonkers decision” to ban doctors whom the NHS desperately needed. “It’s absolutely barmy that one branch of government is trying to increase the capacity of the NHS and another branch is stopping it from doing so”, he said. Hospitals have been unable to hire doctors they had identified as highly skilled and necessary recruits because the cap on the number of professionals given a visa has been reached in each of the last seven months. The Home Office had made clear that if the rules were to change so they would operate differently in the third quarter of the year, which includes August, when newly-qualified young doctors start their NHS training, any relaxation of the policy had to be agreed by the end of this week. It is unclear if nurses will also be taken out of the cap system. They are already classed as a shortage occupation by the Home Office’s migration advisory committee. As such some nurses have been deemed a greater priority than doctors in recent months when officials have been deciding who will get tier-2 visas. Hunt has argued that doctors and nurses should be treated differently to other skilled migrants on a temporary basis, until increases in the numbers of homegrown staff he has instigated produce more British NHS staff. “If reports that the cap will be lifted for doctors are true, it will be a welcome relief to trusts in addressing immediate staff shortages, to help ensure safe, high quality care,” said Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts in England. “These visa restrictions have been a major obstacle to recruiting much-needed medical staff. For trusts it has resulted in unfilled vacancies, often filled by paying premium locum rates. For doctors, they may have given up on working in the NHS and decided to work in another country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3df86d930e88f2458aa0c5d1ad08320291947fc/0_242_4041_2425/master/4041.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac187714279b8e71b648066f9bf38913","title":"david haye retires from boxing tony bellew defeat","story":"Nearly eight years after he vowed to retire on his 31st\u0026nbspbirthday, David Haye was adamant on Tuesday that he is walking away from boxing for good. Revealing for the first time details of long and painful back surgery that curtailed the latter part of his career, he said: “I have given my heart and soul to boxing for 27 years.”And no sooner had the transatlantic shouting match between Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder descended into another strident and pointless exchange than Haye stole everyone’s thunder – although it was hardly a surprise, given the way Tony Bellew battered him to defeat in the fifth round of their rematch at the O2\u0026nbspArena in London last month. It was a brave, doomed farewell for the former world cruiserweight and heavyweight champion who, at his best, was among the most exciting fighters in the world.He strongly suspected before the fight that the future belonged to Joshua, Bellew, Wilder and a hunting pack of young and not-so-young contenders – such as Tyson Fury – who are too strong and fresh for him, but he was determined to find out for himself the only way he knows how: in the ring.Joshua and Wilder are now locked in a ping-pong match of offer and counter-offer, although the odds are their unification fight will take place in the UK this year, probably after the British multi-belt champion makes a mandatory defence against Alexander Povetkin.Eddie Hearn responded by saying: “It’s great that he’s come back to us. We made this offer about four weeks ago and I don’t know if he’s come back because he’s heard we’re close to closing the Povetkin fight or whether he wants the fight. But, either way, he’s going to be getting a contract from us asap.”It is the sort of exchange Haye was adept at throughout a 32-fight career that began in 2002 and which delivered some great nights – winning the cruiserweight title from Jean-Marc Mormeck in Paris in 2007 – and less memorable evenings, such as his 12-round survival exercise against Wladimir Klitschko in 2011, after which he attracted universal ridicule for blaming his poor performance on a sore toe.The latter part of his career will be remembered for serial cancellations because of injury, particularly ahead of aborted bouts with Fury. But he lit up British boxing like few other big men, an uncompromising knockout artist who stopped 26 of his opponents, while failing to get to the final bell three times himself.In a long and detailed statement, Haye said: “Thanks to boxing, I have been able to live my unencumbered childhood dream, a dream my dad, Deron, facilitated the moment he took me to Fitzroy Lodge amateur boxing club as a nervous 10-year-old.”He also revealed for the first time the full extent of his physical struggle in recent years. “If I had it my way, I would have fought as many as 16 times in the last eight years. But, unfortunately, my faulty body only allowed me to step through the ropes on seven occasions for four wins, three losses. Often it was a fight just getting to the ring in one piece.“In the past five years I have snapped both biceps, my rotator cuff and my achilles tendon. All four injuries were potentially career‑ending and each of them required operations with months of intense rehabilitation.“The biggest physical challenge I had to face, however, was spinal surgery in March 2015. I herniated a disc in my lower back 10 years ago and years of intense training wore this disc away. This caused fragments of disc to push into my spinal nerve passage, resulting in chronic pain and loss of function in both legs. An operation was required to put a two-centimetre metal cage between two vertebrae and implant two metal rods with screws and bone grafts to fuse it all together.“This was one battle I had to fight in private, and it’s only because the process was recorded for a documentary that people will one day be able to grasp the severity of the situation.”With The Hayemaker, there is always a deal around the corner. He is a promoter now and will no doubt bring his special brand of hype to the business – and, given the details of his injury problems, will not be tempted for one last big night in the ring, whatever the money."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac5a100e719bc8f82e4216fd5aba58b442ba57a/0_28_2688_1613/master/2688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b4bf5f134516cecb224e41aa8abb735","title":"moeen ali england australia odi series cricket","story":"Moeen Ali has promised to remain a free spirit with the bat during England’s series with Australia and the all-rounder has no regrets about the shot that caused his demise against Scotland.Moeen looked to have steered Eoin Morgan’s side to their target of 372 at the Grange on Sunday, only to pick out long-on when attempting to hit the left-arm spinner Mark Watt over the rope going for a fourth six in his innings of 46 from No\u0026nbsp7.Scotland went on to a famous six-run victory, but Moeen will continue to play his way and is feeling in form after hitting 114 from 75 balls for Worcestershire against Warwickshire in the Royal London Cup last week.“When shots are going for six and you’re playing well, everyone is trying to big you up,” he said. “Mis‑hit one, get out, all the negative people come out.

This, the 118th staging of the major, has included its most famous participant warn that players may miss tee times because of traffic chaos in the vicinity of the course.An abundance of recent and high‑profile US Open matters include widespread criticism of course condition at Chambers Bay in 2015 and a rules abomination featuring the 2016 champion, Dustin Johnson. The tournament’s last visit here, in 2004, became infamous for borderline unplayable greens during round four.Given Woods is not prone to loose comment, this will be interpreted as a high-profile warning to the United States Golf Association. Woods is staying in his $20m yacht – named Privacy – docked in nearby Sag\u0026nbspHarbour. Presuming he can properly negotiate the daily route to Shinnecock, Woods will seek to end a major victory wait that started after this event in 2008.Twelve months ago, Woods was in the early stages of recuperation from a fourth back surgery. Last May, he was arrested on a driving under the influence charge. Asked how his life had change since the latter, embarrassing event, his answer was curt. “It has gotten better,” he said.The 42-year-old was more expansive on the changes to his professional situation since the last US Open, which he watched on television. “There’s really was no expectation to have the thought that I could be here again. I was just given the OK to start walking again, start moving around so I hadn’t been cleared to start lifting yet. It was about just having my standard of life. Forget golf. Can I participate in my kids’ lives again? That’s something that I had missed for a few years and that was the main goal of it.His prospects have been endorsed by Jordan Spieth. Woods and Spieth played a practice round here on Sunday, with the Texan suitably impressed. “He’s playing good enough golf to win a tournament at any point in time,” he said.“Nobody would ever count out probably the most clutch putter and short-game player of all time and then he’s striking the ball extremely well, the rounds I’ve played with him. He’s hitting the driver long and straight, working it both ways. It’s a matter of time in my opinion.”Woods reflected on a bittersweet year when he has finished second at the Valspar Championship and been in contention to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational but failed to challenge at the Masters. “There’s two ways of looking at that,” he said. “I’ve given myself chances to win. Then again, I’m not happy with the fact that I didn’t win because I loved how it felt being there.“I’ve had my opportunities. I’m very thankful to have had those opportunities. I didn’t know if I was going to have them again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/073a52a74f36896433b57fbc9285604b8414e4fa/0_91_1311_786/master/1311.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20888db4d546a9bfc2d59a61affbdba9","title":"england v south africa second womens odi live","story":"42nd over: South Africa 230-6 (Kapp 4, Lackay 0) Target 332 The required rate is now 12.75.

A dot follows, then Tryon backs away and though she’s not set at the point of contact, still manages to belt six over cover! She’s got an eye, she has. But Shrubsole comes back well, her final three deliveries yielding just a single. 40th over: South Africa 216-5 (Tryon 32, Kapp 2) Target 332 Kapp scoops a leading edge around the corner that gets her off the mark with two. The required rare is now 11.38.Oh yes!

Elwiss does everything right, running around to get under it, then spills it! Whoops!

She tries, coming across her stumps to open up the leg side, Sarah Taylor-style, but can’t get enough of it ... but then she can! Forward, across, down on one knee and six over midwicket! 36th over: South Africa 182-4 (Du Preez 5, Tryon 7) Target 332 This is all very sedate now. Four singles is all South Africa can manage, amid an appeal for caught behind when Tryon may or may not have edged. Surely the batters will have a dart now. 35th over: South Africa 178-4 (Du Preez 3, Tryon 5) Target 332 Elwiss has been much tighter in her second spell, but Tryon drives four as Wyatt chases, bellyflops, and misses. There are two other singles from the over, which is to say these need to steam in. 34th over: South Africa 172-4 (Du Preez 2, Tryon 0) Target 332 The required rate is at a fat, round 10.00 at the end of the 34th, and the question now is whether England bowl South Africa out or not. There we go. Ecclestone, looking to cramp Van Niekerk, bowls straight and full, but Van Niekerk has no choice but to chuck hands at it anyway. She can’t get under the ball properly, it flies high into the air, and is caught comfortably at mid on. 33rd over: South Africa 171-3 (Van Niekerk 9, Du Preez 2) Target 332 Du Preez gerts off the mark with a Red Bull single the required rate is now 9.60. This is an excellent catch. Lee cuts hard and it flies to point, phizog-height Wyatt does really well to get the hands up while taking half a step back, and that is probably that. What an innings, though! 33rd over: South Africa 166-2 (Lee 116, Van Niekerk 7) Target 332 Back comes Elwiss, her field suggesting a full and straight line...32nd over: South Africa 166-2 (Lee 116, Van Niekerk 7) Target 332 Ecclestone replaces Brunt here we go. Or he we don’t go both Lee and Van Nikerk look to free their arms, but three singles is all they manage and this is slipping away from South Africa now. Well bowled, Sophie Ecclestone. 31st over: South Africa 164-2 (Lee 115, Van Niekerk 5) Target 332 After three dots, Van Niekerk has a slash at Shrubsole, but the ball goes just pass Wyatt’s e. But only a single more follows, and we’re at that point again: someone needs to do something. 30th over: South Africa 160-2 (Lee 114, Van Niekerk 2) Target 332 England will want to see the back of Lee before Shrubsole and Brunt come off again and the spinners have to come on, but in the meantime the required rate has climbed to 8.6 - not impossible to achieve, but for 20 overs, very difficult. “By absolutely any standards it’s possible to imagine, that’s a sensational effort,” says Robert Wilson of Liselle Lee. “A second fifty in 22 balls from an opener, just as the run-rate is starting to get a bit hairy. Talk about bending the game to your will. It’s less a sign of mental strength than a gross insult to probability. Wow.”Yep, it’s been brilliant. And I think she can go again too - does Sarah Taylor keep her top bowlers out there and hope they get a wicket, or keep them back for another go at the end? 29th over: South Africa 157-2 (Lee 113, Van Niekerk 1) Target 332 Lee hasn’t been able to attack England’s opening pair in the way she persecuted the rest of the attack, and two runs plus a wicket is a brilliant effort from Anya Shrubsole. Yorker-length ball from Shrubsole and Luus gets hold of it nicely - it’s right in her slot - but picks out Brunt at deep square, who slides under it with no little expertise. 28th over: South Africa 155-1 (Lee 112, Luus 2) Target 332 Brunt gets a proper shy at Luus, who manages a single around the corner from her fourth ball. Lee then can’t find the gap, yes she can, the final delivery of the over strays onto the pads and is duly twisted for four through deep backward square. 27th over: South Africa 150-1 (Lee 108, Luus 1) Target 332 Shrubsole returns, seeking to exploit the new batter, and Lee takes a single from her third ball Luus can only manage the same from what’s left. The required rate is now 7.97. 26th over: South Africa 148-1 (Lee 107, Luus 0) Target 332 The batters crossed, so it’s Lee on strike and she plays a late cut that defeats the short third man, there especially not to be defeated by that shot. Wolvaardt’s hardly had a hit this last bit, and she looks to go over the leg side but doesn’t get enough of it and Jones takes a simple catch. I’m not sure if that’s a good change from Sarah Taylor, or one she should’ve made half an hour ago. 25th over: South Africa 140-0 (Lee 101, Wolvaardt 31) Target 332 The highest successful run chase in women’s cricket came in 2012 when Australia made 289-6 to beat New Zealand, which is to say this would be the best and by a street. Anyway, Sciver replaces Ecclestone and Lee deflects one back of a length, which comes on perfectly when she gets in a big stride, over square leg for six! So Sciver goes fuller, and again Lee gets down the track and use the pace to add four through square leg! We are witnessing something very, very special! Yes we are! a controlled pull, that’s 15 from the over, a century for Lee, and what an innings this has been! Power, patience, skill and touch, it’s all there - her second 50 took just 22 balls. 24th over: South Africa 125-0 (Lee 87, Wolvaardt 30) Target 332 Lee has gone! She swivels on a leg side one from Marsh, caressing it around the corner for four, then cuts a wide one for four more - pressure now for England. As I’ve said all along, she’s martialing this chase perfectly. But the rest of the over yields just two singles, so achieving the run rate but without cashing in given what’s to come back. 23rd over: South Africa 117-0 (Lee 78, Wolvaardt 29) Target 332 South Africa are, though, finding gaps in the field more easily than before, and Lee brings up the hunnert with a deft turn around the corner for four. And look at that! She gets down on one knee to marmalise Ecclestone over wide mid on for six, then annihilates a full toss over square leg and onto the roof of a local accountant’s. she is such a clean and powerful hitter! Surely England will try and break this partnership now? Anyway, there’s a break while they seek the ball, but that’s 17 runs off the over. 22nd over: South Africa 96-0 (Lee 61, Wolvaardt 29) Target 332 England have not often looked, and do not really look, like getting a wicket. I wonder if England might soon bring back Brunt, Shrubsole or both, because they’ll be starting to wonder. But there’s a limit to how many overs can go by without even getting close to the required rate, and this here is another. 21st over: South Africa 92-0 (Lee 59, Wolvaardt 27) Target 332 Ecclestone and her SLA continue, and Lee absolutely mashes her over midwicket, over the fence and against the catering tent. “Shot!” she tells herself, and South Africa are starting to up the pace. 20th over: South Africa 79-0 (Lee 51, Wolvaardt 26) Target 332 Laura Marsh comes on and Lee cuts her hard, earning four through backward point. Lee then edges ... but it keeps low and goes between Taylor’s pads for four! The lights are on now, and the players are starting to dry the ball, but there it is covering itself in dew when Lee cuts again, this time squarer, and that’s her fifth fifty in six innings. She’ll have to convert this one, I shouldn’t wonder, and that’s drinks. 12 off the over, and the required rate is now 8.30. 19th over: South Africa 70-0 (Lee 39, Wolvaardt 25) Target 332 England raised their hundred in the 19th over but South Africa seem content to nurdle - despite facing a new, young bowler in Ecclestone - like it’s the 1992 World Cup final. Except it isn’t, they don’t have Wasim Akram, and they’re batting second. This is actually quite strange now.

The acclaimed American playwright and actor – who played Nancy McNally on The West Wing – glances at the rehearsal room floor, draws breath and begins the opening monologue of her one-woman show, Notes from the Field, assuming the voice of famed civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill.“It is impossible to talk about the criminal justice system, mass incarceration, without talking about education,” Smith says, capturing both the matter-of-fact exasperation and scholarly expertise you can imagine the NAACP Legal Defence Fund’s veteran president exuding.The monologue is one of 19 speeches that make up the 90-minute show – all verbatim extracts from interviews Smith conducted herself or speeches made in public, which explore the uniquely American phenomenon of the school-to-prison pipeline. The play is her first appearance in London for more than 25 years, and won critical acclaim when it was performed off-Broadway in 2016, including from President Barack Obama.America incarcerates almost a quarter of the global prison population, with by far the highest rate of imprisonment in the world. The prison-industrial complex began during Nixon’s war on drugs and has continued to proliferate ever since, giving rise to a system that disproportionately punishes people of colour. Feeding into this dysfunction is a public school system, increasingly punitive and over-policed, that feeds the machine with young adults – disproportionately black and brown – abandoned by formal education. Smith’s work seeks to engage this dark trend with a group of characters carefully chosen from more than 250 interviews the playwright conducted around America over a period of roughly three years. It is the latest in her On the Road series, encompassing more than a dozen plays using verbatim interviews as the foundation for drama. She flits between young people caught at the harsh end, and teachers, judges, activists and politicians who see the problem from different personal and historical vantages. The performance combines these perspectives with live musical accompaniment and video clips documenting the contemporary events her subjects are grappling with. It is an extraordinary accomplishment, which provides a rich exploration of the subject through deeply personal narratives. But how does she think audiences in London will engage with such a raw, perhaps alien, exposé of contemporary America, when the play comes to the Royal Court this month? “I’m honoured to be invited, but I haven’t pursued London since that time as a place to go with my work, because I’m very mission-driven,” she says. “I’ve thought maybe I’m just too American. I’m very aware of my mission in America, my place in America.” She recognises, of course, that the UK has long faced its own entrenched prejudice within the criminal justice system, albeit on a scale that is dwarfed by the juggernaut of American inequality. And she suggests a meaningful run in London, at a theatre located in one of the most affluent boroughs in the city, is ultimately about raising awareness. “I would say that success in London would be if anyone’s concerned, and concerned enough to see how that plays out in England. Racism is not unique to the United States.”There is a pang of sadness watching Notes from the Field, recorded as a live action movie for HBO, in the era of the Trump presidency. The play was researched throughout the Obama years and, although its subject matter touches on some of the darkest moments in his presidency – from the racist massacre of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, to the riots in Baltimore – it is a reminder that the nation’s first black president had actively engaged with the need for sweeping reform of America’s broken criminal justice system.Trump, who branded himself the “law and order candidate”, has already taken significant measures to roll back any of the progress made by the previous administration and appointed former Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, who has had to deny allegations of racism, to be his attorney general. Smith says the play has not been significantly altered since it was first performed in the Obama years. “I’ve always had a sense of purpose with this project. So, I don’t think that’s changed because Trump is president. He’s not helping the plight of poor kids, and he’s not helping the disparity between rich and poor, and he’s not helping our situation with regard to what punishment has become in this country at all. But the problems were here before Trump.”And yet, she says, certain points within the work now carry a different weight. A closing moment sees the actor assume the role of congressman John Lewis, the civil rights veteran brutally beaten by police officers during civil disobedience in Selma, reflecting on a moment of reconciliation with one of the officers there that day in 1965.“Hold on. Never give up. Never give in. Never lose faith. Keep the faith,” she says as Lewis. The intensity of the performance leads her to what she describes as a “monkish existence” during runs. She avoids loud places, won’t kiss or hug anyone after shows, and mostly heads straight home to bed – all in a bid to keep free of germs, preserve the quality of her voice, and sit with the weight of the stories she is telling.Smith, who received a George Polk award – one of America’s highest journalism honours – for her body of work last year, is nonetheless uncomfortable with the label of a journalist. “You’re supposed to be objective,” she says to me, forthrightly bashing her fists on the desk we’re sitting at. “So you can’t call yourself an art form, even if it’s beautiful and it has that aesthetic value. But I can say that I’m looking for metaphors to reveal the truth. I don’t have to say I’ve found the truth. You do.” She accepts though that her research methods bear a similarity to the journalistic process itself: travelling long distances, booking in interviews as the trip unfolds and speaking to people about the most desperate, difficult moments in their lives. I tell her that the play had a profound effect on me in a way that theatre rarely does. Many of the events included were stories I covered on the ground. Some of the characters in her work are people I have interviewed, too, and it brought up feelings of residual trauma associated with covering the endless cycle of violence and brutality in American society. As a reporter there is a tendency, as I have experienced, to lose the ability to empathise with your subjects, and I wonder if it’s something she feels, too? “The compassion fatigue is something very, very serious,” she says. “In my case, I respect what I’m carrying. I know it’s not light. But I’ve been training to carry it for my whole life. You know, it’s rough.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ab6e137aec22f53629acdd96e8e40fa0c9363a1/0_304_4640_2784/master/4640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb534450c802887180edbfdd6103bd3e","title":"10 best surf schools in world portugal hawaii south africa norway","story":"What sets these surf schools apart is a commitment to excellence when it comes to tuition, which will help you to catch a wave from Portugal to Hawaii, South Africa to Norway Surf camps provide a taste of the surfing lifestyle and include accommodation and transport, as well as social activities where you can meet other surfers.

File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe .The Cabinet has agreed that a referendum should be held later this year on removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan brought a proposal to Tuesday’s meeting seeking approval to proceed with the referendum, which is expected to be held in October.It would likely take place at the same time as a referendum on changing a constitutional clause that prioritises a woman’s domestic role over work. The votes on the two topics and may coincide with a presidential election, if one takes place. Voters will be asked whether Article 40.6.1 (i) should be retained in the Constitution. Blasphemy is defined as “matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion”.The Defamation Act 2009 made blasphemy a crime punishable by a €25,000 fine. As far back as 1991, the Law Reform Commission recommended that the offence of blasphemy be removed from the Constitution. The law came to prominence last year when a Garda inquiry began after a complaint was made over British actor and comedian Stephen Fry making critical comments about God during an interview on RTÉ. No prosecution was brought in the case.“By removing this provision from our Constitution, we can send a strong message to the world that laws against blasphemy do not reflect Irish values and that we do not believe such laws should exist,” Mr Flanagan said. Article 41.2 of the Constitution prioritises a woman’s domestic role over work with the Constitution saying the State “recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved”. “The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home,” it continues. The Constitutional Convention examined this issue and reported to the government in 2013. Some 88 per cent of members voted against its inclusion in the Constitution. Meanwhile, 98 per cent voted in favour of amending the wording to render it gender-neutral. It was also proposed to include other carers both “in the home” and “beyond the home”.Planning for a referendum on that issue is less advanced but the proposal is also expected to be put to voters in October. -the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3527772.1528802054!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british minister resigns over irresponsible brexit strategy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA file image  Phillip Lee who resigned as Justice minister on Tuesday. Photograph: AFP British prime minister Theresa May has suffered a ministerial resignation ahead of crunch Commons votes on Brexit, with Phillip Lee hitting out at the Government’s “irresponsible” approach.Remain-supporting Dr Lee quit as justice minister on Tuesday, saying he could not support “how our country’s exit from the EU looks set to be delivered”.He said his main objection to government policy was over the “wish to limit parliament’s role in contributing to the final outcome” and signalled he would rebel on the issue in the Commons later.Dr Lee also called for the government’s final proposals to be put to the public in a second referendum.“When the government is able to set out an achievable, clearly defined path, one that has been properly considered, whose implications have been foreseen, and that is rooted in reality and evidence, not dreams and dogma, it should go to the people, once again, to seek their confirmation,” he wrote.The issue of a “meaningful vote” is set to be a flashpoint in the Commons, with ministers seeking to overturn a Lords amendment which would give Parliament extensive powers to direct ministers how to proceed if a deal with Brussels is rejected by MPs or no deal is reached.The government’s compromise is that a minister would come to the House within 28 days of a deal being rejected to tell MPs what will happen next, but an amendment tabled by former attorney general Dominic Grieve would insist on a binding Commons motion.Dr Lee, who represents the Leave-voting Bracknell seat, said in a lengthy resignation statement: “Our parliament should be able to direct our government to change course in our interests.“In all conscience, I cannot support the Government’s decision to oppose this amendment because doing so breaches such fundamental principles of human rights and parliamentary sovereignty.“A vote between bad and worse is not a meaningful vote. And I cannot bring myself to vote for it in the bastion of liberty, freedom and human rights that is our Parliament.”Dr Lee added: “If Brexit is worth doing, then it is certainly worth doing well regardless of how long that takes. It is, however, irresponsible to proceed as we are.”A Downing Street source said: “We will get a good Brexit deal that works for everybody in the UK.“The government’s amendment today provides for a meaningful vote.”Dr Lee’s shock departure came as David Davis warned potential Tory rebels that they cannot undo the EU referendum, ahead of a tricky 48 hours in which the government will try to get its Brexit programme back on track.“A meaningful vote is not the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.“We will put in front of parliament the decision for them to vote ... after that there will be a process of primary legislation to put the actual details of it in parliament, so parliament will actually decide on the application of the detail.”Asked what would happen if they voted against the deal, he said: “If they throw it out, well, they throw it out. We will have to go away, think about it and come back and make a statement, which is what I am saying to the House this afternoon.”However, Devon Tory Sarah Wollaston signalled on Tuesday morning that she would back Mr Grieve’s amendment.Dismissing the Government’s compromise, she tweeted: “Merely issuing a statement in response would make it a meaningless final vote.“Grieve’s amendment puts that right and in a way Govt could and should accept it.”She said unless there was a “meaningful vote” parliament would be left with “the grim choice between a poor deal and exit with no deal at all”.It would also give hard Brexiteers the chance to “scupper a good deal”, she claimed.The prime minister appeared to have defused a potentially explosive row over the EU customs union on Monday night as Tory pro-Europe rebels Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan and Brexiteers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Sir Bill Cash came together to table a separate compromise amendment backing “a customs arrangement” with the EU.Government sources signalled that ministers were set to back the move.However, the compromise is only likely to delay a full-blown showdown on the customs union until trade legislation returns to the Commons in July. - PA Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3528227.1528823647!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mps vote against holding meaningful ballot on final brexit deal","story":"British MPs have voted 324-298 against a Lords amendment to include a meaningful vote in Parliament on the final Brexit deal.

Photograph: Getty ImagesBritish prime minister Theresa May won a vote in parliament on Tuesday, winning over potential pro-European Union rebels in her party with a compromise on plans to give parliament a meaningful vote later this year on the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU.After a closely-watched debate, politicians voted 324 to 298 to accept a proposal saying that if parliament rejects the final Brexit deal, a government minister will set out how the administration plans to proceed within 28 days.That, combined with a promise to listen to a leading pro-European politician and potentially add further safeguards giving parliament more influence, was enough to see off a rebellion that had threatened to undermine the prime minister’s authority.Prior to the ballot of MPs frantic negotiations to prevent a damaging government defeat over parliament’s ability to block a no-deal Brexit came down to the wire, with rebels and government whips locked in deep discussions hours before the vote.The mood appeared to shift against the government over the course of the afternoon. Justice minister Philip Lee resigned on the morning of the vote and suggested he would rebel against the government.A compromise offered by the government in which a minister would tell MPs what will happen next within 28 days of a Brexit deal being rejected may as well say, “Oh House of Commons, get lost”, a Tory former chancellor has said.Ken Clarke criticised the offer on the “meaningful vote” which seeks to help overturn a Lords amendment which would give Parliament extensive powers to direct ministers how to proceed if a deal with Brussels is rejected by MPs, or no deal is reached.The Government’s compromise is that a minister would come to the House within 28 days of a deal being rejected to tell MPs what will happen next, but an amendment tabled by former attorney general Dominic Grieve would insist on a binding Commons motion.Speaking as MPs debated the Lords amendments, Mr Clarke said the government would produce a written statement among the “piles of written statements we have every day”.He told the Commons: “What does the government say in its amendment that the House should be faced with? Within 28 days, a written statement will be produced amongst the piles of written statements we have every day – and dare I suggest not every member of parliament usually bothers to go through the piles of written statements?“What’s a written statement going to say? It could say, ‘well in that case there’s no deal, we’re leaving.’ It could say, ‘well we’re going to do this and that’s it, that’s the end of the parliamentary process.’“It might as well say ,‘Oh House of Commons, get lost.’ And that is a wholly inadequate response to the votes we had before Parliament.”Mr Clarke also rejected the idea of a second referendum, saying he hoped to “never live to see another referendum in my life”.He made the comments after Tory Sir Bill Cash asked Mr Clarke to explain “whether he believes that it is possible with the meaningful vote to actually manage to maintain the Brexit process. Does he not accept that the effect of a meaningful vote is actually to reverse the Brexit process. And furthermore that it is, to use an expression, completely failing to understand the nature of the amendments to suggest otherwise?”Mr Clarke said the debate had been dominated by the argument from Brexiteers that the meaningful vote amendment was an “attempt to get around the referendum”.But he explained: “Much though I regret it, but I was on the losing side in the referendum, after the majority in article 50 we are going to leave the European Union. I don’t join these campaigns to have a second referendum. I hope I never live to see another referendum in my life.”Veteran Tory Brexiteer Sir Edward Leigh said it would be a catastrophic blow if the Government lost: “Parliament, don’t stand against the people, implement their will.”Mr Clarke intervened during Sir Edward’s speech and spoke about the “important process of parliamentary accountability”.Sir Edward replied: “This really is the ultimate wrecking amendment and it’s not wrecking of parliamentary sovereignty, it’s wrecking of the will of the people, of democracy.”Labour former minister Hilary Benn said a meaningful vote was the one opportunity before the end of the negotiations for MPs to have their say.“It is the only opportunity to make it clear to the Government that we intend to have our say when the negotiations have been concluded: this is the one chance that we have to exercise the sovereignty that all of us believe properly rests with this House, whether we voted Leave or we voted Remain in the referendum.”Labour’s Chris Leslie said MPs’ mandate collectively had a value: “We have a duty to safeguard our constituents from harm, that harm could not just affect their livelihoods and their jobs, but it would also affect all the revenues that taxpayers pay towards our public services, so if you care about our NHS you have to make sure that there is a safeguard in place.”Labour’s Kate Hoey said the people of this country would “see through” the Lords amendment: “They will see that this is really about actually trying to go back on Brexit. The reality is the European Commission do not want us to leave, they do not want to give us a good deal, they want to punish us and this motion, this amendment if it goes through I believe actually is a recipe for the EU to actually try to get a no deal so that we will then have to go back cap in hand from this Parliament and ask for changes.” – PA serviceReutersNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"magnum freedom project pictures","story":"1968 was a seismic year of deep societal and political shifts.

The interior minister is leader of her Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and could pull it out of the government, leaving Mrs Merkel without a majority in parliament.Percentage of people comfortable with having social relations with immigrantsWhile it is thought unlikely the clash would come to that, Mrs Merkel was facing a serious challenge to her authority which could limit her ability to negotiate with European Union partners.At the centre of the dispute are Mr Seehofer’s plans to turn away asylum-seekers who are already registered in another European Union country at the German border.Under the EU’s rules Germany can already send asylum-seekers back to the first member state they entered. But cases are only decided once migrants have applied for asylum and few are actually deported: last year only 7,100 out of 64,000 such cases resulted in deportation,Mr Seehofer wants to change that by turning away such migrants at the border. But Mrs Merkel is said to fear such a move could anger other EU countries and wreck her efforts to negotiate a new EU-wide migrant policy.“As far as I am concerned, we will apply European law. Because I only see a solution in European regulation,” she told German television at the weekend.Mrs Merkel is said to be particularly concerned Mr Seehofer’s proposals will upset the new populist government in Italy, which says it is being made to shoulder too much of the burder as one of the main points of entry for migrants crossing the Mediterranean.But Mrs Merkel’s critics say she is more concerned at the damage to her image if she is seen to close the border now after refusing to do so during the migrant influx of 2015.The dispute has reopened the rift between the chancellor and Mr Seehofer, who was the biggest critic of her “open-door” refugee policy in 2015.The two buried the hatchet to put on a united front for last year’s election, and Mr Seehofer was rewarded with control of migrant policy as interior minister. He was set to announce the new measures as part of an asylum “masterplan” on Tuesday.But he is said to be in no mood to water down a key proposals, and reportedly told MPs at a party meeting on Monday he was not prepared to release “half a plan with lazy compromises”.“Seehofer’s masterplan is becoming a disaster plan,” Burkhard Lischka, parliamentary spokesman for Mrs Merkel’s other coalition partner, the centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD) said.Leading CSU members made it clear the party is united behind Mr Seehofer. The party faces regional elections in Bavaria this October and is determeined to fend off a challenge from the nationalist Alternative for Germany party (AfD), which has campaigned against government migrant policy.Please review our commenting policyComment: How worried whips managed to save Theresa May... for nowTrump-Kim summit: Donald Trump vows to \u0026#39end war games\u0026#39 in \u0026#39new history\u0026#39 with North KoreaBritain\u0026#39s first police mugshot shows thief banished to Australia for stealing cushionsTech giants will face state regulation unless they start cooperating with police, Chief Inspector of Constabulary warnsScottish drug deaths increase to record levels amid questions about \u0026#39parking\u0026#39 addicts on methadoneComment: Donald Trump is driving a new world order – with terrifying implications for BrexitDonald Trump shows Kim Jong-un Hollywood-style video laying out the stakes of summitTrachoma: more drugs pledged to fight \u0026#34disease of thorns\u0026#34Comment: We love to laugh at avocado suites and loo carpets, but they\u0026#39re so much more joyful than the tyranny of good tasteIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner made $82m last year while working in White HouseArmed man takes two hostage in Paris\u0026#39Automated\u0026#39 cars put drivers in danger by encouraging them to take their eyes off the road, insurers warnStockholm bans sexist advertising in public spaces Gurkha fights to keep sister in UKMan survives being projected out of car in high-speed crashShopping complex evacuated as Army are called in to deal with suspicious packageTown rallies around mother told not to hang her washing out by launching \u0026#39laundry revolution\u0026#39The human rights atrocities under Kim Jong-un that were not mentioned during summit We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/12/TELEMMGLPICT000166135691_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"armed man takes three hostage paris","story":"The incident is not believed to be terror related Police rescued two hostages and arrested a man at a small business in central Paris on Tuesday after he demanded to be put in touch with the Iranian Embassy to deliver a message to the French government, authorities said.The inidual has been arrested and the hostages are out of danger, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said on Twitter.There were no immediate details on the age, appearance or nationality of the hostage taker.

But the virus takes a week or longer to incubate so it\u0027s still possible it\u0027s out there, he said. Countries most closely connected with the Nipah virus outbreakJake Dunning, consultant in infectious diseases at Public Health England, said the agency was monitoring the disease. “This outbreak presents a negligible risk to the UK public. While southern India is a popular destination for UK tourists, the risk of tourists contracting the virus is very low if standard precautions are taken such as avoiding contact with bats and their environments, not touching any sick or dead animals and avoiding raw or partially fermented date sap.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Some 19 people were infected with the virus, which spreads between humans through contact with bodily fluids of affected iniduals. The Indian government has monitored more than 1,000 contacts of those affected and confirmed that the disease has not spread. The disease is spread through the ingestion of fruit bat secretions, such as saliva. Residents in Kerala were told to wash hands thoroughly and not consume fruit or vegetables partly eaten by birds or animals.According to the Press Trust of India two of those who died were siblings in their 20s who had eaten fruit picked near to where they were building a home. The nurse treating them also died.Nipah is on the World Health Organization\u0027s priority list of pathogens with potential to develop into an epidemic and for which there is currently no vaccine or effective treatment.Last month the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations granted a $25m grant to two US-based companies, Profectus BioSciences and Emergent BioSolutions, to develop a vaccine against the disease.Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the coalition, described Nipah as a deadly pathogen that has already travelled thousands of kilometers, has serious epidemic potential and the ability to surprise us.Nipah virus outbreak | Where could it spread?Nipah was first identified in Malaysia in 1998. It spread to Singapore and more than 100 people were killed in both places. On that occasion, pigs were the virus hosts but they are believed to have caught it from bats.In India the disease was first reported in 2001 and again six years later, with the two outbreaks claiming 50 lives.Both times the disease was reported in areas of the eastern state of West Bengal bordering Bangladesh.Bangladesh has borne the brunt of the disease in recent years, with more than 100 people dying of Nipah since the first outbreak was reported there in 2001.In Bangladesh in 2004, humans became infected with Nipah after eating date palm sap that had been contaminated by infected fruit bats.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyFrench photographer charged with rape in Nobel Swedish Academy scandalComment: How worried whips managed to save Theresa May... for nowTrump-Kim summit: Donald Trump vows to \u0026#39end war games\u0026#39 in \u0026#39new history\u0026#39 with North KoreaBritain\u0026#39s first police mugshot shows thief banished to Australia for stealing cushionsTech giants will face state regulation unless they start cooperating with police, Chief Inspector of Constabulary warnsScottish drug deaths increase to record levels amid questions about \u0026#39parking\u0026#39 addicts on methadoneComment: Donald Trump is driving a new world order – with terrifying implications for BrexitDonald Trump shows Kim Jong-un Hollywood-style video laying out the stakes of summitTrachoma: more drugs pledged to fight \u0026#34disease of thorns\u0026#34Comment: We love to laugh at avocado suites and loo carpets, but they\u0026#39re so much more joyful than the tyranny of good tasteIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner made $82m last year while working in White HouseArmed man takes two hostage in Paris\u0026#39Automated\u0026#39 cars put drivers in danger by encouraging them to take their eyes off the road, insurers warnStockholm bans sexist advertising in public spaces Gurkha fights to keep sister in UKMan survives being projected out of car in high-speed crashShopping complex evacuated as Army are called in to deal with suspicious packageTown rallies around mother told not to hang her washing out by launching \u0026#39laundry revolution\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/12/TELEMMGLPICT000166116362_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPMvwEv6xuoDlmzv6f7Gk6Hf7hV0jJyuAppLRc0BQkuU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"town rallies around mother told not hang washing launching laundry","story":"Residents have hung out their washing in support of the mother-of-twoIt was once the epicentre of the fight against the Catholic monarch James II, earning a reputation as “the most rebellious town in Devon” after its men volunteered in droves to follow the Duke of Monmouth.Now the winds of dissent are once more blowing through Colyton, but this time over the delicate matter of underwear.Where once the struggle was over the question of religion and who could lay rightful claim to the throne, today’s uprising turns on a woman’s right to hang her smalls out in public.It began when Claire Mountjoy, a single mother of three, received an email from local traders instructing her not to hang her washing out to dry for fear it would lower the tone of the neighbourhood.In response hundreds of fellow residents have taken to displaying bras, nighties, pants and other items of laundry outside their homes in a show of solidarity with Ms Mountjoy.Claire Mountjoy - and laundry - outside her house in Colyton, DevonThe email was sent by an anonymous correspondent on behalf of the Devon town’s traders, claiming that the sight of her underwear hanging outside Ms Mountjoy’s small terraced home was likely to offend passing tourists.It stated: “I am writing on behalf of local businesses and your neighbourhood to ask you with kindness not to put your washing out at the front of your house.“We all try hard to keep our lovely town thriving and looking good. The visitors walk up from the tram and your terrace is a prime location.While we understand you have a small house with no outside room for your boys, would you please consider using a tumble dryer or hanging the washing indoors.“This letter is not written with malice but we ask you to please help us all keep Colyton a town we can all be proud of.”That was enough to summon up the same spirit of rebellion that led to dozens of Colyton’s citizens to follow the Duke of Monmouth into battle in the summer of 1685.Ms Mountjoy, 47, posted the offending email on her Facebook page and was soon deluged with messages of support.As the great nicker rebellion spread items of underwear began appear on washing lines and clothes racks in front gardens and alleyways across the town - to the presumed chagrin of the anonymous traders.Neighbours began hanging their washing out in public in support of Ms MountjoyMs Mountjoy said: I think it is so lovely that I live in a community that\u0027s so supportive of me and doing something that people have done for generations - hanging the washing to dry outside their homes.The community response has been amazing - the rebellious nature of Colyton has come to the fore and the laundry revolution has begun!Washing drying in the Devon townMs Mountjoy, an education officer for Devon Wildlife Trust, said her favourite gesture of support was the bra that one sympathiser had managed to erect on the top of one of the town’s flagpoles.It shows the fabulous community spirit Colyton has - it\u0027s known as the most rebellious town in Devon. That kind of streak is still in its people,” she said.It is quite strange that someone should be so upset about it. They suggest that visitors would be put off, but actually our laundry revolution is actually bringing in more visitors.Soon hundreds in the town had joined inOn Saturday the local Nunsford Nutters Carnival Club strung up a washing line decorated with pyjamas between the town hall and the Colcombe Castle pub in support of Ms Mountjoy.Gail Jarman, one of the race organisers, said The reaction for Claire has been fantastic - the amount of people who have got behind it is absolutely brilliant. The note is ridiculous - none of us are supporting the person who wrote it. You have got to dry your washing somewhere.Alison Stenning, a neighbour, said We should have an annual Colyton Hanging Day when everyone hangs their washing in front of their house.Colyton earned its reputation as the most rebellious town in Devon after more citizens from the town joined the Protestant rebellion against the Catholic James II than from any other part of the county.The rebellion was led by James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, who claimed to be rightful heir to the throne after James became after King of England, Scotland and Ireland on the death of his elder brother Charles II.Monmouth, an illegitimate son of Charles II, landed at Lyme Regis on 11 June 1685 and over the following weeks his rag-tag army of nonconformists, artisans and farm workers fought a series of skirmishes with local militias and regular soldiers.But the rebels were unable to match James II’s forces and the rebellion ended in defeat at the Battle of Sedgemoor, on 6 July 1685.Monmouth was executed for treason on 15 July 1685 and hundreds of his supporters were condemned to death or transportation by Judge Jeffreys, during a series of notorious trials which came to be known as the Bloody Assizes.Please review our commenting policyTrump-Kim summit: Donald Trump vows to \u0026#39end war games\u0026#39 in \u0026#39new history\u0026#39 with North KoreaBritain\u0026#39s first police mugshot shows thief banished to Australia for stealing cushionsTech giants will face state regulation unless they start cooperating with police, Chief Inspector of Constabulary warnsScottish drug deaths increase to record levels amid questions about \u0026#39parking\u0026#39 addicts on methadoneComment: Donald Trump is driving a new world order – with terrifying implications for BrexitDonald Trump shows Kim Jong-un Hollywood-style video laying out the stakes of summitTrachoma: more drugs pledged to fight \u0026#34disease of thorns\u0026#34Comment: We love to laugh at avocado suites and loo carpets, but they\u0026#39re so much more joyful than the tyranny of good tasteIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner made $82m last year while working in White HouseArmed man takes two hostage in Paris\u0026#39Automated\u0026#39 cars put drivers in danger by encouraging them to take their eyes off the road, insurers warnStockholm bans sexist advertising in public spaces Gurkha fights to keep sister in UKMan survives being projected out of car in high-speed crashShopping complex evacuated as Army are called in to deal with suspicious packageAngela Merkel faces power struggle as she moves to block policy to close Germany\u0026#39s border to migrantsThe human rights atrocities under Kim Jong-un that were not mentioned during summit We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"alexithymia condition impacts emotions new research science","story":"One in 10 people struggle to recognise their emotions. New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Andy Martin on the man who’ll be guiding ITV viewers through a month of World Cup hyperboleEverybody is a commentator these days. @Chasepacheco1, for example, who tweeted after last month’s Uefa Champions League final:\u0026nbsp“My Liverpool team fought hard and I’m proud of them. Except for Karius, he can die in a hole.” Loris Karius, Liverpool’s German goalkeeeper, let in three goals (one of them, to be fair, a moment of sheer brilliance by Gareth Bale). Which means that online he finds himself denounced as a “Nazi”. And, according to one theory, paid handsomely for his “howlers” by Real Madrid. We can assume that the World Cup in Russia this month will be the occasion of a deluge of similar wildly overheated rhetoric, hyperbole and death threats.But you won’t be hearing any of it from ITV’s chief football commentator Clive Tyldesley. Winner many times over of the Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year award, he is the voice of moderation, the calm centre at the eye of the storm. Occasionally the target of Twitter rage himself, he expects to encounter not just a lot of verbals but also racism, hooliganism, and misogyny on top. Football, he says, is “warts and all. It reflects life. It corrupts. That is part of its fascination.” But, from the heights of the commentary box, he tries to provide something like a counterpoint to all the frenzy, the agony and the ecstasy.He is a fit-looking 63 and described himself as “a respecter of vocabulary” when I went to see him shortly before the Champions League final. “I would never say it’s a ‘disaster’ or a ‘tragedy’ if the ball goes through the goalkeeper’s legs,” he said. “You only use words like that if somebody dies.” He thought he might stretch to “calamity”.\u0026nbspHis words were strangely prophetic. As it turned out that is exactly the word he selected to describe Liverpool’s “goalkeeping calamity” when Karius bowled the ball right onto the toe of Benzema. But it struck me that there was also a kind of poetry, of a restrained, austere kind, in his summary of Real Madrid’s first goal, perhaps something like an instant haiku:And Real Madrid are in front.His “an evening that had started so promisingly for Liverpool” sounded a poignantly elegiac note. I also had to admire the comment, after Karius lets a tame one by Bale slip through his hands and into the net: “His reputation would do well to survive that moment.” Note the use of the conditional tense. Tyldesley appreciates that the keeper’s reputation is already in tatters, but that – perhaps in an ideal world – it could still recover.David Hume said that you cannot get an “ought” from an “is”. Somehow Clive Tyldesley manages to pull that off. He is only describing a game of football but there is an implicit ethics in his commentary. Tyldesley agrees with Bill Shankly that football is not a matter of life and death, but omits the punchline, “it’s more important than that.” Still, it is “a huge emotional investment by all the people who turn on. They choose to watch.” Therefore, as a commentator, “You have to be careful with your use of words.”The Playstation Schools Cup U15 final, between Thomas Telford School and Carshalton Boys Sports College, held at Reading’s Madejski stadium, was as fraught and intense as any Champions League final. Some of the players even had agents already. “Maybe overdid it a bit, Hodnett,” commented Tyldesley, in his simultaneous schools broadcast, as he skyed the ball over the bar. He prepared for this game as scrupulously as he is now preparing for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and had a foolscap file in front of him containing assorted facts about the players.There was a goalmouth melee, which saw both the Carshalton goalkeeper and the Telford player red-carded. And a penalty shootout after the much fancied Telford came back from 2-0 down only to blow it on the last kick of the game. “Now that is absolutely out of order,” said Tyldesley, as the hulking No 10 wrapped a menacing paw around the referee. “He’d have done well to keep his opinions to himself.” It’s advice he has tried to follow.But in a sense all of his commentary implies an opinion. Presumably he would have disapproved of Zinedine Zidane’s farewell headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and David Beckham’s retaliation on Diego Simeone that got him sent off in 1998. Tyldesley himself doesn’t get flustered. He is unflappable. He has – and admires – grace under pressure. “His control wasn’t the best,” as he said in one of his critical remarks about the U15 final. The ability to take and keep control is all important, whether you’re on the pitch or off it.This might have something to do with having been subjected to the furious “hairdryer” treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson when still manager of Manchester United, not just once but twice. “You really can feel your hair blowing backwards.” He thought that the boot that hit David Beckham in the face in the dressing room was “probably an accident”.Whether it’s broadcasting to schools or to 10 million people on ITV, Tyldesley always feels a sense of “responsibility”. “Balance” is a key word. He points out that the dying words of Pheidippedes, the messenger who ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to report on the outcome of the battle back in 490BC, “We won!”, only caused confusion, because people were bound to ask, “Who is ‘we’?” “He wasn’t a good journalist,” says Tyldesley. “What he should have said is ‘Athens won’.” Greece 1, Persia 0.He was once commentating on an England-Scotland game with Ron Atkinson when Atkinson insisted on saying “we”. Tyldesley said to him, “You should say ‘England’ not ‘we’.” Although he accepts that there perhaps he was being “correct beyond reason”. He allows that the occasional we “might slip out” at the World Cup. “I’m English but I’m still objective. You don’t choose to support England. It would be odd to switch to supporting Chile.”Tyldesley disapproves of those who get too fancy. “A straightforward pass would have done,” is a classic line of his, which happened to be addressed to schools. So too when it comes to commentary. He argues that cricket and golf have passages of inaction which permit – or even demand – “colour”, the kind of lyrical and expansive discourse, infinitely digressive, forever associated with John Arlott and Brian Johnston in cricket or Peter Alliss in golf. Steve Bunce likewise in boxing, and I can get similarly carried away when it comes to describing surfing, perhaps because there are often long lulls between the epic and the awesome.Tyldesley is more a fan of plain speaking. He says the best ad slogan of all time is Ronseal’s “Does exactly what it says on the tin”. That’s how he thinks commentary should be. You observe, you analyse, you try not to hype it up. You keep it “succinct”. “There’s no point trying to be Wordsworth or Browning. As Barry Davis once said, “One man’s commentator is another man’s pain in the arse.”Everything is mediated and mediatised. There are no exceptions. The old Zen koan, “If a tree fell over in the forest and no one was there to witness it would you still hear it?” now has a clear answer. Yes, because it would be captured by a passing drone or on satellite TV, blazed all over Instagram, tweeted about furiously, the tree’s friends on Facebook would start a crowdfunding campaign, and it would shortly thereafter be the subject of a controversial Channel 4 documentary. Nothing happens any more without commentary. But this is and always has been especially true of football. “They think it’s all over… it is now”, Kenneth Wolstenholme’s line, is as memorable as the 1966 World Cup final itself. Whether or not the ball crossed the line is less significant now than the fact that there was so much debate about whether or not it had. And new technology is not making the debate go away, rather the opposite.I can’t play football without also hearing something like this in my head:\u0026nbsp “Martin comes on, scores with his first touch, and the crowd goes wild.” As Simon Critchley, philosopher and (currently distraught) Liverpool fan comments in his book, What We Think About When We Think About Football, “We usually know football through commentary, through largely, and hugely, inane commentary.”Tyldesley doesn’t think of it as inane. “Sometimes,” he says, “‘a game of two halves’ is exactly what it is. You can’t improve on it.” If he were to write a book about it, it would be something like the opposite of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. Hornby is all about irrational fandom, ritual, intensity of feeling. Tyldesley is more of a phlegmatic “keep calm and carry on” sort of guy. “We don’t need to see that!” he exclaimed at the sight of an overflow of emotions on the sidelines with even teachers getting hot under the collar.Albert Camus said, “I learned everything I know about morality from football.” Which is to say, when it comes to the “beautiful game”, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all on display. There are undoubtedly heroes and villains in Tyldesley’s narrative. But he does it subtly. “You try not to sound too much like a Methodist preacher,” as he puts it. When it comes to making criticism of the play – you could call it a judo throw – by Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain, that resulted in Mo Salah going off in agony with a dislocated shoulder, Tyldesley is judicious but still uncompromising in his remarks. There is “a coming together with Ramos that only he can fully explain”. As he goes up to collect the cup, Ramos is described as “not everyone’s idea of a model professional – maybe nobody’s”.There is even an implicit politics in his commentary. Tyldesley has no objection to big money in football. “It’s labour intensive, they’re entitled to be paid. You can’t do without inidual players.” But still “the collective should be stronger than the inidual”. And this is where we went so badly wrong in the Brexit campaign, and the adjacent media coverage, he argues. “We turned it into a personality competition. Instead of providing the relevant information, we focused on the impact it would have on the lives of politicians.”He says that “the most popular team in this country is not Manchester United or Liverpool, it’s England. It’s a great democracy.” And he has to be “inclusive”. He would never use the word “esoteric” for example, he says, because he doesn’t “want anyone to have to get up and look for a dictionary”.When I saw him, Tyldesley was prepping Arabic and Russian names. He says, “I will try to get it correct, but I will not make sounds we don’t make in the English language.” When identifying James Rodriguez of Chile in the past, he wanted to say “James”.\u0026nbspEventually he bowed to pressure from Twitter to say “Ham-es”, in the Spanish manner. “But later I learned that his father,\u0026nbspa 007 fan,\u0026nbsphad named him after James Bond.”\u0026nbspHe felt vindicated, because in Spanish-speaking countries it’s always James, never Ham-es, Bond.\u0026nbspHe is not, he reckons, “responsible for the teaching of Spanish” or Arabic or Russian.In an extremist, Dionysian world, Tyldesley is an Apollonian voice of reason. He holds the mirror up to football with minimum distortion, minimum fuss. Sound without the fury. A degree zero of poetry. Let’s hope he doesn’t have to repeat a line he first used of England versus Iceland in 2016, “This is the most abject failure that I can recall.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.This is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Standing in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Below, a square hole in the rock floor denotes a sacrificial spot from the time of the Dedanites. Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Deploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.And a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sending vulnerable victims of trafficking back to the place they were trafficked from risks pushing them straight back into modern slavery,” she told The Independent.“It also means that victims won’t come forward or ask for help for fear of being sent straight back again. Instead of tackling modern slavery, this risks strengthening the power of the traffickers.”Labour MP Vernon\u0026nbspCoaker, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on human trafficking and modern slavery, said the current policy was “outrageous” and “totally and utterly unacceptable”.“Immigration policy seems to be riding roughshod over the needs of victims of trafficking. With much of this we’re talking about confirmed victims. These are not people who are playing the system, they are cases where the Home Office themselves have said these are victims of some of the most serious crimes,” he said.“It’s going to put people off coming forward, and it’s going to undermine the government’s own strategy on cracking down on trafficking and modern slavery. If the government is true to its rhetoric around supporting modern slavery victims, this would not be happening.”The Home Office accepted that Mr Nguyen was a victim of trafficking last August. He was released on bail last year and relocated in Glasgow, where he began volunteering for a number of charities, but he was detained again last Monday and issued the deportation notice.He is currently being held in Colnbrook detention centre, in Harmondsworth, awaiting deportation on Thursday.Describing his trafficking ordeal, Mr Nguyen said: “I worked but I had no money. I knew nothing about cannabis. They told me they couldn’t sell it because my skills to cultivate it were so poor.“When I realised it was illegal, in my mind I had a plan to escape\u0026nbspbut I couldn’t\u0026nbspbecause they are gangsters and part of an underground group.\u0026nbsp“They would come in and open the door and then leave again. I had to wake up after midnight to turn on and off the lights and to water the cannabis. I often had to stay up overnight.“I couldn’t get out. The house lacked oxygen – all the windows and the doors had live power on them so I would get electric shocks if I tried to open them.”Eight months into the exploitation, police raided the property and Mr Nguyen was arrested and sentenced to 15 months in prisonThe Vietnamese national described his imprisonment as “hard, but better than\u0026nbspgrowing cannabis,” adding: “I felt more freedom in prison.”Expressing his fear of deportation, the Vietnamese national said: “I feel very nervous. I don’t know what will happen to me in the future. I would be scared to go back because the gangsters will be out to get me. If I was to return I fear I will be killed.”Mr Nguyen’s situation has prompted a renewed push for changes to legislation to ensure adequate\u0026nbspsupport is\u0026nbspprovided to modern slavery victims, after a report by the National Audit Office urged there was\u0026nbsp“much more to do” to ensure victims in the UK are protected.At\u0026nbsppresent,\u0026nbsppeople who are officially recognised to have been trafficked through the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) – the UK’s official framework for identifying victims of human trafficking –\u0026nbspreceive no long-term support or automatic immigration status in the UK.Janet Fisher, advocacy manager and a solicitor at anti-slavery charity Hope for Justice, said the number of victims the organisation was seeing being threatened with deportation was “definitely increasing”, and claimed the issue was an as yet uncovered element of the hostile environment policies.She told of one client who\u0026nbspwas recently taken from their safe house, which is\u0026nbspwhere trafficking victims stay after they are rescued,\u0026nbspby immigration enforcement officers in order to carry out their deportation. The removal was later halted after\u0026nbsplawyers intervened.“We’ve had a number of trafficking victims who have been deported and then been pursued by their captors and fled straight back again. It’s a growing problem. It’s one of a number of things which are happening in the hostile environment but are only anecdotal at this point because they haven’t come to light,” said Ms Fisher.“We know that traffickers are mentioning the threat of deportation when they are exploiting people as a way of keeping control. One man was shown his own house on Google Earth by his trafficker to show they knew where he lived, so didn’t want to report the abuse out of fear. There are genuine threats to people.“The government must focus their immigration efforts on the people doing the trafficking, not the victims. But we know there have been many more victims facing deportation than traffickers.”Bhaveshri Patel-Chandegra, a solicitor from Duncan Lewis who is representing Mr Nguyen, said: “So many people get put off reporting because word gets around and they think if this is how I’m going to be treated, why should I claim?“There needs to be a change in the policy. People are being recognised as victims but then left without status. They’re left with nothing. What’s the point in being recognised as a victim if they’re not going to have any kind of support?”Kate Roberts, head of the Human Trafficking Foundation, echoed the concerns, saying: “There is a conflict between the immigration enforcement and the rehabilitation and victims’ needs, and supporting people to ensure they have a chance to rebuild their lives and not be re-trafficked.\u0026nbsp“It’s symptomatic of the huge focus on immigration control and its prevalence above everything else.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not routinely comment on inidual cases.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But EFTA has a coordinated customs policy of its own, meaning also joining both it and maintaining a customs union with the EU could prove difficult. The EEA agreement as it stands would likely need some form of renegotiation to make it compatible with a customs union.The current agreement also does not cover VAT or agriculture, the latter of which would be particularly important to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland.‘Norway-style deal with EU will not prevent Ireland hard border’ Norway-style Brexit declared ‘dead’ by Labour MP Norway drops objection to Britain joining EEA after BrexitEurosceptic parties expected to benefit from Norway electionWhat is the single market and EEA? Can the UK stay in after Brexit?Labour, which wants to stay in a customs union with the EU, ruled out voting for the EEA amendment partly on that basis. The party has said\u0026nbspit wants to retain access to the single market but has suggested it would try to negotiate changes to freedom of movement and state aid rules, as well as a say in how rules are drawn up.The government is refusing to vote for the amendment and is instead seeking a “bespoke deal” without freedom of movement, membership of the single market\u0026nbspor membership of a customs union. It has not settled on a final customs proposal, with two options, both already rejected by the EU, under consideration by the cabinet.\u0026nbspMr Barnier has in the past repeatedly said that the UK would have to stay in the single market and a customs union in order to have frictionless trade with the EU after Brexit. But there has been little public detail so far on how this would be achieved.\u0026nbspIn July he said that “the regime of the European Economic Area for Norway, for Iceland, for Liechtenstein still entails a system of procedures and customs controls” and that “only the combination of the internal market and the customs union guarantees the free movement of goods”.MPs are set to defy their party leaders and back the EEA\u0026nbspamendment, which was introduced by the House of Lords (PA)Single market membership removes the need for regulatory checks on products arriving in ports, while the customs union removes the need for checks on rules of origin and customs duties.Some Brexiteers say staying in a customs union with the EU is not a good idea because it means the UK would not be able to sign its own trade deals with other countries. Those that oppose single market membership say the UK would be bound by rules that it had little say in making. Critics of those positions insist that\u0026nbspas a large bloc the EU can obtain better trade deals than the UK on its own, and that British\u0026nbspbusinesses would have to follow single market rules anyway if they wanted to export to their nearest major market.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

This can only be achieved by keeping the UK in the single market and a customs union.“If there is anything blocking this model for our future relationship it is red lines drawn up in the UK, and specifically Labour’s manifesto commitment to end freedom of movement.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

You’ve been a stain on this country’s character for decades. I’m not interested in your bullying. I will do what I believe to be best for the country and people I love.”\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, the Labour MP for Streatham, pointed to both front pages with the comment: “These people think they can intimidate and threaten members of parliament.

I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible.“But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.”Ms May looks set to avoid a humiliating defeat on a vote scheduled for Wednesday on the customs union.

Clause 1 makes specific reference to newspapers printing headlines not supported by the textIn perhaps the most notorious front page of the past few years, the Mail derides the High Court judges who ruled that parliament must have a vote on whether to trigger article 50 and start the Brexit processIn the Express\u0027 take on the same story, they manage to incorporate the Union Jack, allude to First World War propaganda, invoke memories of Churchill and, of course, state Brexit means BrexitThe Sun marked the day on which Mrs May triggered article 50 by projecting a huge and terrible pun on to the Cliffs of DoverReferencing their notorious eurosceptic headline from 1990 (See: Up Yours Delors), the Sun stokes the flames of the brief Gibraltar dispute, a dispute in which Spain, the supposed aggressors, only joined to note that there was no need for itThis headline followed Mrs May\u0027s snap election announcement, which gave the Mail hope that dissenting opinions on Brexit would disappearIn recent months, the Mail has often forgone catchy headlines in favour of rambling rants, this is an early example aimed at Tory Brexit rebelsThis headline (?) takes aim at the Lords over their repeated amendments to the EU Withdrawal BillOn the day that the EU Withdrawal Bill is to be debated in the Commons, the Sun offers two choices to MPs, desperately including all conceivable imagery that might make Brits feel patriotic, which apparently includes the Loch Ness MonsterOn the same day, the Express lets MPs know what the consequences of the vote may beBut the government remains vulnerable to a damaging defeat on a “meaningful vote” amendment which would hand Parliament a decisive say over what happens next if it rejects a final Brexit deal. A compromise amendment on the issue has been put forward by the pro-EU rebel Dominic Grieve but the government is yet to declare whether they will be supporting it.\u0026nbspLabour’s Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, wrote in the  on Tuesday: “Instead of negotiating for Britain, the Prime Minister is lurching from crisis to crisis, increasing the risk that the talks break down, and we crash out without an agreement.

It\u0026nbspis unclear whether ministers\u0026nbspwill agree to that time limit, which is likely to be proposed\u0026nbspin a further amendment to be tabled in the House of Lords.Nevertheless, for the first time, Theresa May appeared to be entertaining the idea of a deadline for success in the talks.In total, the government hoped to overturn 14 amendments made in the Lords to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, but there was a risk of a Tory rebellion on a series of knife-edge votes.See below for live updatesSNP\u0027s Ian Blackford raises a furious point of order about the lack of time, which he says is an attempt to force through a power grab by Westminster.\u0026nbspPlaid Cymru\u0027s Liz Saville Roberts raises a similar point, saying it sets a corrosive precedent for Welsh interests.\u0026nbspSpeaker John Bercow says he understands the sense of grievance but the House has complied with its standing orders.MPs are now voting on a string of other amendments.\u0026nbspHowever the more interesting ones are now due to come tomorrow, including clashes on the customs union and the single market.David Lidington is opening the debate, but Labour\u0027s shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman says it is disgraceful that he is the only voice that will be heard.\u0026nbspThe Cabinet Secretary says it is her own frontbench\u0027s fault for choosing to have\u0026nbspso many votes on similar issues.\u0026nbspHe discusses one of the key amendments, which commits to there being no checks or controls on the Irish border.\u0026nbspMr Lidington says the government agrees with the spirit of the bid and has put forward several amendments to tidy up the amendment.MPs have now moved onto the second set of amendments for the day, which mostly focus on devolution.\u0026nbspBut, as the earlier votes took so long, there is only 15 minutes for debate. Scottish and Welsh MPs are absolutely furious about this.MPs voted by 317 votes to 306, majority 11, to disagree with Lords amendment 45, also linked to Henry VIII powers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe government\u0026nbspalso managed to overturn another amendment by\u0026nbsp321 votes to 305, which sought to prevent the use of secondary legislation to implement a withdrawal agreement until Parliament has approved a mandate for negotiations about the UK\u0027s future relationship with the EU.\u0026nbspLead Tory rebel Dominic Grieve\u0026nbsphas spoken about the concessions offered by the prime minister.\u0026nbspHe said: The PM\u0026nbspagreed that the amendments we had tabled, and the issue that we had raised about parliament\u0027s role in the event of no deal, was an important one and undertook to work with us to put together amendments to present in the Lords which would address those concerns.The former attorney general said he expected two parts of his amendment to be taken on by the Government, stating: The two parts provide the mechanism by which Parliament has to be consulted in the event of no deal and the Government come forward with a motion explaining what it will do.And that in the event of a deal being rejected, the same thing will happen.MPs are now voting on a Lords amendment that would\u0026nbsplimit\u0026nbspministers\u0027 powers under the bill so they could be used only when necessary, rather than when appropriate. The amendment is defeated by 332 votes to 306.Keir Starmer, Labour’s Shadow Brexit Secretary, commenting on the meaningful vote amendment, said: “This vote was about ensuring Parliament was given a proper role in the Brexit negotiations and that we avoid a no deal situation, which is becoming more likely with the isions at the heart of this Government.“However, facing the prospect of a humiliating defeat Theresa May has been forced to enter negotiations with her backbenchers and offer a so-called concession.“We will wait and see the details of this concession and will hold Ministers to account to ensure it lives up to the promises they have made to Parliament.Just two Tories voted for the amendment (Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry) while five Labour MPs voted with the government against it (Campbell, Field, Hoey, Mann and Stringer)New: MPs have voted by 324\u0026nbspto 298 reject the Lords amendment on a meaningful vote. Majority for the government of 26.MPs voted by 326 votes to 301, majority 25, to disagree with Lords amendment\u0026nbsp37, which was part of an attempt to remove the exit day from the Bill and allow\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspCommons\u0026nbspto rethink its approach.MPs voted 324 to 302, majority 22, to disagree with Lords amendment 110.This had sought to give greater powers to the sifting committee, which would be established to decide whether statutory instruments proposed by ministers to amend retained EU law after Brexit would require a\u0026nbspCommons\u0026nbspvote.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Macedonia is a candidate state for EU membership.Under the deal\u0026nbspcountry’s name would be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, to reflect the existence of the Greek region of Macedonia on the other side of the border and the cultural claim Greeks see over it.

Nationalists in both countries are opposed to compromise and could yet derail the accord. The agreement is set to be formally signed on Saturday at Lake Prespa, which straddles the country’s border, and that of neighbouring Albania.There is no way back.“The name change will be implemented not only in the country\u0027s international relations but also domestically,” Mr Tsipras said in a televised press conference, while Mr Zaev, speaking separately, told his countrymen: “There is no way back.” The PM called on the opposition to back the name change and said it would guarantee access to the EU and Nato.In Greece, the right-wing Independent Greeks party, which is in Mr Tsipras\u0027s governing coalition partner, has said it would oppose the agreement in a parliamentary vote – meaning the left-wing prime minister will need to seek support from political opponents.Negotiations, which have been on and off for decades, have intensified in recent months under the oversight of EU, US, and German diplomats.Ancient Macedonia was the cradle of warrior king Alexander’s empire, but under the Romans the province of Macedonia was expanded to include territory ning Macedonia, as well as Bulgaria and Albania.Some Greeks have accused Macedonians, who speak a Slavic language, of appropriating aspects of Greek culture.

She held crisis meetings with Mr Davis, Mr Johnson and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox before offering an aspirational end date.

And, with free trade often hinging on the free flow of information, Brussels is presenting a tough line on allowing Britain continued access.Britain has asked for a special deal on data-sharing laws after Brexit, involving the establishing of a \u0026ldquoone-stop shop mechanism.However, this essentially leaves Britain preparing to replicate the EU\u0026rsquos ruleset into British law.This will be complying with a harsh set of rules imposed on selected non-EU countries \u0026ndash New Zealand, Israel, Switzerland and Uruguay \u0026ndash who have data transfer agreements with Brussels, according to Michel Barnier, the Commission\u0026rsquos chief Brexit negotiator.The flow of data is vital in maintaining a quality relation between Europe and in order to protect links Britain wants to sign a bespoke data treaty, which would effectively replicated the pre-Brexit arrangement.Mr Barnier has ruled out the regulatory cooperation Britain has suggested. He said judgement on British standards would be an \u0026ldquoautonomous EU decision.

meaning they have more control over the curriculum and other aspects of the school.Theyre held accountable for their performance through a funding agreement.Meanwhile, maintained state schools are overseen by the local authority, and have to follow the national curriculum and stick to national pay and conditions for teachers.Grammar schools are also state-funded but they select their pupils using an entrance exam called the 11-plus.The 11-plus usually involves sections on Maths, English, Verbal Reasoning and Non-Verbal Reasoning.But critics of grammar schools say they dont meet their aim of giving opportunities to brighter pupils, regardless of their background - as poorer kids 11-plus results are undermined by other children whose parents pay for expensive tutoring.Private schools charge fees to attend - which, according to research reported by the BBC, range from £13,194 to £30,369 on average per year.The more expensive private schools tend to be boarding schools, with the fees covering living costs during term time.Private school fees can be reduced through scholarships, based on academic talent or other abilities in sport or music - while some offer discounts for multiple siblings attending the school.Similarly to grammar schools, private schools can be selective, and often have an admissions test to choose their pupils.In the run-up to the general election in 2017, Theresa May pledged £500million to build 140 new free schools.Free schools were first approved in the Academies Act 2010 and championed by former Education Secretary Michael Gove.They are not council-run, but are funded by the government, and often set up by parents, charities, businesses, and religious groups.Therefore, they do not need to follow a national curriculum and can set their own pay and conditions for teachers, but are not permitted to make a profit.In the October 2017 Tory Party Conference, the PM reaffirmed her pledge and promised to build 100 free school every year that she is in parliament.In May 2018, Education Secretary Damian Hinds announced schools in England would receive £50m to create new places.But the announcement was met with a furious reaction by the National Education Union which said: The grammar school corpse has climbed out of its coffin once again despite evidence of the damage that selective education causes.The programme is now being redirected towards the worst-performing areas of England, particularly the North East.Ministers said they will be targeting the next wave of about 35 new schools in the bottom third of lowest-performing areas - following criticism that the programme had focused on the wealthier South East.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats how serious I was about getting that job.Kazi then found business success after launching perfume company Sunnamusk, but for the past two and a half years, hes been focused on his real dream: starting an airline.Breaking into the airline business is a monumental challenge for anyone, but Kazi has no industry experience at all - and hes dead set on keeping to his religious morals.Malaysian carrier Rayani Air is an example of a Sharia airline - although it was shut down in 2016Kazis chief adviser, veteran aviation consultant John Brayford, has been concerned about the feasibility of Kazis Sharia business plan from the start.If you look at the airlines around the world that dont serve alcohol, theres not one of them which can be considered successful, John says.But Kazi was always reluctant to budge on his principles, even when he attracted a barrage of hateful online comments from Islamophobic trolls who made jibes about kamikaze pilots and making stopovers in Islamic State territory.However, he has recently decided that his controversial Sharia angle has turned into a PR headache - so hes started to tone it down a bit while courting passengers and investors.The entrepreneur told Sun Online: When you say Sharia compliance, people will take it as Sharia enforcement, which isnt the case.But were trying to position ourselves to Islamic investors. Theres obviously the halal food and then modest dressing - I dont believe in exploiting women to get more business.There will be no alcohol but we will try to use substitutes.The under-experienced and overenthusiastic businessman dreams of flying long-haul to the Middle East, but first he needs to establish some short-haul routes to make a name for his airline and earn some money.In the documentary, we follow Kazi as he opens negotiations to fly out of Londons Ashford Airport and Waterford Airport in Ireland.Normally, airlines pay airports a fee in return for being allowed to fly from them, but wheeler-dealer Kazi was audacious enough to demand that the airports should be paying Firnas.With this unorthodox request, Kazi gets a firm no and negotiations collapse, forcing his ego to make an emergency landing.But it turns out that Kazi, banking on his negotiations going well, had already signed a £60,000-a-month lease on a 72-seater turboprop plane, egged on by business partner and fellow Bangladeshi Abdul Roqueb.He may be used to cleaning toilets, but Kazi had never been in it that deep before.The would-be airline boss was paying thousands for his plane to sit on the tarmac, with nowhere to fly it and his credibility in tatters.Still haemorrhaging money, Kazi cancelled the lease on his pricey 72-seater and returned to the drawing board, where he decided that flying short commuter hops are his only hope if he wants to break into the notoriously change-averse airline business.With nothing to show for two years work, it was time to go plane shopping again - but this time Kazi had to dial down his enthusiasm, and act a bit less like a kid in a sweet shop.On the show, we see him poking around a much smaller 19-seater Jetstream plane - a sturdy little craft but a world away from the long-haul Dreamliner Kazi wants to see in Firnas colours.Hes clearly underwhelmed by the tired-looking upholstery and creaking seats, and he knows that his hopes of flying to the Middle East couldnt be further away.That hole there, says Kazi to the planes pilot and owner, as he inspects the wing. Is that meant to be there?Raging at his team, Kazi adds: This is not the plan. Every decision we make we have to go right back to the bottom. Its going on and on and costing me money every day.But he has no choice. If he wants to start an airline, he has to start small - and in this business, the Jetstream, at a cost of £8,500 a month, is as small as it gets.Today, it finally looks as if Firnas first aircraft is ready to fly - and Kazis journey from plane cleaner to plane owner is complete.Kazi has raised around £500,000, money which will be used to lease planes and cover the many costs of getting set up.His nifty little Jetstream plane has been painted in a fetching shade of Firnas purple, and is ready to be sent on short commuter runs between UK cities.And despite the online backlash, Kazi is still committed to filling the gap in the market for an Islamic airline.Its about brand positioning - its about being different and sticking out from the crowd, a chirpy Kazi tells us.We want to be a premium airline.

He has been at RSPCA kennels for three months.Weighing in at almost eight stone and standing over a metre tall, Patch may be the size of a Shetland pony but hes the ultimate softie.He craves tender love and care and he lives for fuss and to be spoiled, say the staff at the Southport animal centre he currently calls home.He is best suited to living in an adult-only house without other pets because he needs to be the centre of attention.And he will need a big garden or live near some outdoor space to run around.Come to think of it, he’ll need a pretty big bed too.American Bulldogs are stocky yet agile and typically need a lot of exercise so hell suit active owners.For more info about rehoming Patch, click here.Name: BillyThe RSPCA rescued Billy and a number of other dogs in February 2014. He had been kept in a small cage stacked up with other dogs in a warehouse.He spent two years in boarding kennels while the case when through the courts and then moved to the RSPCA centre.Billy has a degenerative condition affecting his sight and leaving him almost completely blind. He needs owners who can help him adapt to his new surroundings.He has been learning directional commands and copes well with his deteriorating vision - he still loves a game of fetch and will use his sense of smell to sniff out the ball.Billy would like an active home in a rural area where he can spend lots of time with his owners.Kelpies are highly intelligent and need plenty of activities to keep their clever minds occupied.More info about BillyName: JaggerJagger came into the RSPCA care five months ago with a large tumour on his foot, which happily vets were able to remove.He’s fully recovered from months of healing and physiotherapy, and back to his usual self - loving to bound around outside.Like most Dobermen, he’s intelligent and likes learning new things. He’d benefit from training to build his confidence because he gets a bit scared around cars and traffic.Weighing in around around six-and-a-half stone and standing just over a metre tall, Dobermen need at least an hour of exercise daily to all expel their energy.Jagger is a big softie and loves his toys so much that he likes to carry them in his mouth for his whole walk but hes less keen on cats.More info about JaggerName: JackJacks owners could no longer keep him and has been in RSPCA care for two months.He loves squeaky toys, if he hears a ‘squeak’ he’ll come running.He adores people and has been known to man the reception desk at the centre where he enjoys greeting visitors.The staff who look after him all says he’s a real sweetheart who would like an attentive owner who can work with him on basic training and teach him it’s ok to be left alone.Pugs are a small, quiet breed that are relatively inactive when indoors.Though playful and rambunctious, they dont need a lot of space - an excellent choice for families with small homes.More info about Jack2. Settling inJust like us, dogs can get scared or worried sometimes, especially in an unfamiliar new environment.If they had a favourite toy or blanket at the RSPCA centre, put that in there so they have at least one thing that smells familiar.Establishing a routine is key. Walks, feeding and bedtimes should be around the same time each day so they will know what to expect and build a trusting relationship with you.Take your time. Going from an RSPCA kennel to a new home can be overwhelming so just be patient, let them settle into the new home first and get to know you and the immediate family. Then gradually introduce them to new people and environments.3. Keep them happy and healthyDogs are intelligent and inquisitive so along with lots of exercise they’ll need toys and training activities to keep them entertained.They communicate through body language so owners need to learn to recognise what their signals mean so you can protect them from things that make them anxious or sad. Follow these tips and youll enjoy life with your new rescue dog and know that you’re giving a dog that may never have had a happy home a second chance at a happy life.Name: BolloBollos previous owner became homeless and could no longer care for him properly.He has been in RSPCA care for seven months, having arrived at RSPCA Halifax, Huddersfield, Bradford \u0026amp District Animal Centre, in West Yorkshire, late last year.Bollo is a laid-back dog who loves spending time with people.He spends his mornings out walking with the animal centre volunteers and his afternoons with the rehoming co-ordinator in her office.He loves sleeping under the desk and enjoys saying hello to visitors.He also enjoys spending time learning new commands and loves playing with toys, whether it’s chasing balls or chewing toys.He’s a gentle giant who would love to find a home to call his own.Japanese Akitas are large, handsome dogs who need plenty of space and exercise.It’s recommended that they get at least two hours of activity every day. They are likely to love playing in the garden throughout the day too.More info about BolloName: HarleyHarley was given to the RSPCA in February when his owners could no longer care for him properly.He is a happy chappy with a dazzling Staffie smile.He’s extremely affectionate and loves nothing more than a cuddle.There will be an adoption fee to pay that goes towards helping the RSPCA continue rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming more dogs.These fees vary by centre from around £135 for adult dogs to £200 for puppies under six months.All RSPCA dogs are spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. And they come with free MORE TH\u0026gtN pet insurance for the first six weeks.While he loves people, he’s a little unsure around other dogs so staff have been working hard to socialise him and would like his new owners to continue positive interactions with friendly dogs.He’d love a big garden to run and play in, and a cosy sofa to curl up on at night.Hes a medium-size dog who needs at least an hour of exercise a day but wont suit sharing a home with other pets.Despite their tough guy reputation, Staffies as a breed are popular dogs to have around children, due to their calm, tolerant natures.More info about HarleyOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The most dangerous would be a mortal blow to the Government’s negotiating hand and could trigger a new election.Another one on Wednesday would be a giant step towards shackling ourselves forever inside an EU customs union, without any power over its decisions. That’s the worst possible Brexit, a catastrophe.Monday nights fudge between the two wings of the Tory party is still a risk — and merely postpones an inevitable showdown next month.In the end MPs must have faith in our great country, our extraordinary talent and our ability to thrive outside the EU. And, if they respect the democracy that has put them where they are, they must trust the decision we took.Todays “meaningful vote” amendment, if passed, would wreck the Government’s negotiating position in Brussels. That is already weak enough... Theresa May has made far too many compromises and is doing far too little to prepare Britain for a “no deal”. But this new move would be deadly.It would enable Parliament to reject any deal we strike with Brussels and force the Government to go back and keep negotiating. It would strip Mrs May of the power to walk away.The EU could offer us a derisory and punitive deal knowing Parliament had compelled the Government to accept it in the end. It would be like haggling with a used car salesman who knows you have to pay whatever he wants.The diehard Remainers running an orchestrated, multi-million pound campaign to keep Britain in the EU are relying on this vote to upend the process. It could trigger a second referendum or an election which Corbyn’s Marxist wrecking crew could win.Tory rebels must have nothing to do with it. It is their duty to give the Government the strongest possible hand in negotiating our exit and a future trade deal.Another vote on Wednesday seeks to push us into a restrictive customs union with the EU. That would place us permanently and powerlessly under Brussels’ control — with no say over it, nor any ability to sign our own deals around the world.Free trade with America, China, India, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? Forget it.Remain-backing MPs pretend this — and staying in the single market — represent “soft Brexit”, a compromise to reflect that 48 per cent voted Remain. But they are fatal to Brexit and they know it.Either would be a far worse deal than we have had before. They are a ruse to engineer a new vote to stay in.We get that Europhile MPs hate Brexit. But they are there to represent their voters, not advance personal agendas.For some Tories and many Labour MPs the decision should be blindingly obvious: their own constituencies voted Leave. The manifestos on which they then stood for election last year promised to leave both the single market and customs union.Do they seriously believe it right to betray their voters and their own doorstep promises?Most people are too busy to follow the daily ins and outs as the Brexit debate grinds on. Outside the London political bubble, they imagine it’s done and dusted. They just want to get on with leaving. And in full.It has barely occurred to them that many politicians never accepted the result, have waged war on it relentlessly and are closer than ever to victory.Imagine the explosion of anger if that happens. If, today or next month, Tory Remainers vote with Labour’s opportunists to defy the biggest democratic mandate in British history. If MPs, having approved the EU Withdrawal Bill once already, back wrecking amendments drafted by unelected peers bent on destroying Brexit.That rage won’t even be limited to Leavers. Many Remainers also consider it vital to fulfil the result of the vote in full. They know staying in the single market or customs union is not leaving. It is a suicidal, half-baked Brexit.Why would anyone trust our democracy again if we took such a course, in defiance of the referendum result?The Sun understands the Tory rebels’ fears for the economy and jobs post-Brexit. We believe we may well be in for a rocky ride short-term, before the longer-term benefits pan out.But everyone should read the authoritative view from ex-Aussie Prime Minister Tony Abbott — who initially backed Remain but is brimming with confidence over what he considers a golden opportunity for this country, even if we never strike any deal with Brussels.The Sun understands, too, the worries many Remainers have that Britain could become less ­liberal, less open and more prejudiced against foreign migrants after Brexit. We whole-heartedly believe that’s unfounded.Brits are becoming MORE welcoming, secure now in the knowledge we are at last about to get the same control over numbers every non-EU country enjoys.On these two ​vital days for Brexit — and further votes next month — The Sun says this to backbench Tories: Have faith in the people of Britain.They made the right decision on Brexit and they will make it work... if you allow your Government to give them the chance.THE most Eurosceptic people in Britain are calling on Theresa May to make good on her promise that Brexit means Brexit.The Lincolnshire town’s Tory MP Matt Warman was a Remainer but now advocates a “clean break” from Europe in agreement with 74.9 per cent of his constituents.Office worker Beverly Iles, 67, said: “We should have come straight out. We shouldn’t be still messing about with all this.”Retired council worker Brian Isam, 75, said: “We don’t need soft Brexit. We didn’t pay Europe a penny when we went in and we should not pay them a penny to get out.”THE people of Hull want Theresa May to wave goodbye to the Eurocrats now.In the East Yorkshire city, the leave vote was 68 per cent, although Labour MP Karl Turner was a Remainer.Happy Cakes manager Debbie Scaife, 56, said uncertainty had driven up the price of ingredients.She added: “Mrs May, I call on you to do this for us now.“The British public voted to leave. They didn’t want five years of hell.”Retailer Vicky Paddey, 37, said: “I voted for Brexit and I’m proud to say that — it was what people wanted then and they still want it now. If we end up with a soft Brexit, a lot of these shops in this city centre will not survive it.”IN the North East, some impatient voters are calling for dithering Mrs May to go.Voters in Gateshead went 56.8 per cent in favour of leaving in 2016, against the wishes of Labour MP Ian Mearns.Florist Dawn Athey, 41, said: “I think Theresa May should resign.“She’s not the person I thought she was going to be.“I think she’s scared of being the Prime Minister who’s going to take us out of the EU.”And Jude Ditchburn, 51, from Gateshead, said: “I think she is betraying the country and not doing what people want.FORMER Tory Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan is a leading Remoaner — but in her Leicestershire constituency people want to get on with Brexit.The area voted 50.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU.Brexit backer Andrew Cooper, 56, said: “They are dragging their feet, the people have voted for this and they need to do what the people asked them to do.”Cedric Hewitt, 90, said: “I think Theresa May ought to get her finger out and get on with it. It’s what the British people wanted.”And David Greasley, 85, a former quality control engineer, said: “I voted out and simply want out.”HARD Brexit opponent and Conservative MP Anna Soubry wants Britain to be shackled with a customs union.Now, they want her party to carry out their wishes.Ray James, 82, and Elsie James, 80, said: “We think the Government are failing to get things sorted. It is taking a long, long time and no people thought it would take this long.”John Wilson, 68, said the Government was clueless on disentangling from the single market. “It has become a shambles,” he added.TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston switched sides during the referendum campaign and became a Remainer.But she is out of step with her Devon constituency, where 53.9 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU.Christine Williams, 64, said she was disappointed with Dr Wollaston.“I don’t know if I can now vote for her in the next election,” she added.Butcher Chris McCabe, 70, blamed Theresa May for the slow progress.He said: “This is like the Champions League final and we are at half-time.“She still has a chance but she needs to get her team in order so they can go back out and win this.”WHILE the capital was the heartland of Remain, in Bromley, South London, there was a paper-thin majority of 50.6 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. Tory MP Bob Neill is a Remainer.Gardener David Alden, 52, said: “It’s been dragged out for a reason. They know how to grind people down and tire them out. The elites want one thing and try any way to get it. They want to stop Brexit.”Retired software developer Steve Johnson, 58, said: “They are trying to come up with these fudges — ways to try to renege on the will of the people without outwardly doing so.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Endangered not only by parliamentarians who never really accepted the referendum result, but by the Government’s negotiating approach, which risks delivering an exit from the EU which fails to deliver the control Britons voted for.When, on June 23, 2016, 17.4million people went to the polls to vote for Britain to chart a new course for itself outside of the European Union, they would never have imagined that, almost two years on, Parliament would still be debating whether to keep this country as — essentially — a non-voting member of the EU.Or that their government would still not have set out a detailed blueprint for this country’s relationship with the EU once we have left. So what has gone wrong and who is to blame?There are TWO BASIC RULES of negotiation. Know what you want and do not go into a negotiation unless you are prepared to walk away.Theresa May’s government has FAILED BOTH OF THESE TESTS.Even now, the Government can not say what it wants Britain’s customs arrangements with the EU to be after Brexit. Instead, we’ll have to wait for two working groups to report back before the Cabinet makes up its mind.This failure to know what it is trying to achieve has hobbled Britain in these negotiations — and handed the initiative to the hardliners in the European Commission. Mrs May must take the blame for this.She should never have triggered Article 50, the two-year process for leaving the EU, until she had a clear and precise idea of what she wanted the exit deal to look like.It has also meant that, in the absence of clear UK aims, those conducting the negotiations have treated the whole thing as a damage-limitation exercise.As the Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has been sidelined in the talks in favour of the civil servant Olly Robbins, complains in private, the civil service is not suited to negotiating.It struggles to deal with European chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s take-it-or-leave-it tactics.But the biggest mistake has been the failure to rigorously prepare for no deal. Mrs May used to emphasise that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.But she has never followed through on that rhetoric. There has been no big national effort to get this country as ready as it could be to walk away from the talks.There is plenty of blame to go round for this. The Treasury — aided by the Chancellor Philip Hammond — has refused to make planning for no deal a priority.Why? Because it feared if there was a plan for no deal, the Brexiteers would end up using it. Better, it thought, to make minimal preparations for it to ensure the UK stayed at the negotiating table.But this got it ALL WRONG. The best way to avoid no deal was to plan for it. For WEAKNESS IS PROVOCATIVE. The EU looks at how unready Britain is to walk away and turns the screw.Would Michel Barnier’s team feel free to be so dismissive about Britain’s proposals if they thought we might simply walk out of the talks, taking our £39billion divorce payment with us?It is worth remembering that a report from the House of Lords, hardly a hotbed of Brexiteer sentiment, concluded that Britain was under no legal obligation to pay ANYTHING AT ALL to the EU on leaving.The Government risks being left with the most unpalatable of choices: No deal or stay in a customs union with the EU and the European Economic Area, leaving Britain as, effectively, a non-voting member of the EU.Senior EU figures think they can do this because they do not see any serious attempt by the UK to properly prepare for no deal.If this country had made preparations for going it alone that were so big they were visible from the other side of the Channel, the EU would be engaging in the negotiations in a far more constructive manner and Britain would be on course to secure a much better deal.Leave-supporting Cabinet ministers can not escape their share of the blame for this, either.They should have been far more assertive and pushed for serious no deal planning.They should have insisted that Cabinet was updated every fortnight on Britain’s preparedness to walk away without a deal.They should have demanded that the Government had serious and credible contingency plans to deal with disruption to cross-Channel trade. They should have told Mrs May they would resign if Hammond would not provide the funds necessary to make no deal planning a reality.But there is, as the minutes of the Brexit Inner Cabinet’s most recent meeting make clear, another reason why “EU ministers had no fear of no deal”.They “observed the UK Parliament and prominent Remainers, who had formed a cross-party alliance against Brexit, and thought there was no chance of no deal”.Too many MPs voted for a referendum on our EU membership, then were not prepared to genuinely accept the result when they lost. Too many Tories were prepared to stand at last year’s General Election on a manifesto of leaving the single market and the customs union that they were not actually committed to. That is not being straight with the voters.One of the other reasons EU ministers are not worried about no deal is Mrs May’s loss of the Tory majority in that snap election.Ever since Britain voted for Brexit, the EU has feared the emergence of an alternative economic model on its doorstep.It worried Britain might become a hyper-competitive, low-tax economy 26 miles off its coastline.They expected that Britain would respond to no deal by slashing taxes and regulation to make up for the failure to strike a trade deal with the EU. This gave the EU an incentive to come to an agreement with us.But when the Tory majority disappeared, so did this fear. It is clear this hung parliament does not have the stomach for such a course.Indeed, Mr Hammond said in Germany in January that we would change our “economic model” if we could not get a good trade deal, then took that threat off the table in a visit to France the month after the election. He, unhelpfully, told the French press we would keep up the European economic model even after Brexit.The next big British mistake has been its handling of the Irish border issue. The history of Northern Ireland meant this subject needed to be treated with care. A return to every vehicle being stopped would clearly have been a recipe for trouble.But Britain should never have agreed in December that no new physical infrastructure at the border meant there could not even be number plate recognition cameras.The decision to rule these out has made it far harder to use technology to try to solve the border issues and has been grist to the mill of those who want to use Northern Ireland as a device to keep the whole of the UK in a customs union and “high alignment” with the EU and unable to strike comprehensive free-trade deals with other countries.The Government now finds itself urging the EU to accept a UK-wide “backstop” in an attempt to try to get beyond the Irish border issue knowing that the EU will break off trade talks before they have really begun if there is not progress on this.This backstop, though, is not a good deal for the UK. It would see Britain stuck in a customs union with the EU and following all of Brussels’ rules on goods, yet with no say in making them. It would provide a trade solution for goods, where the EU sells £135billion more to us than we do to them, but not for services, where we sell £92billion more to them.In these circumstances, would the EU really be rushing to complete a trade deal with us? Of course not. It would be in their interest to drag things out, knowing that the backstop would remain in place.If the House of Commons votes for the House of Lords amendment to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU or to take no deal off the table, it will weaken Britain’s negotiating position still further.It will make it almost inevitable that the only deal Brussels is prepared to offer Britain would leave this country as, essentially, a non-voting member of the EU.The Government has made many mistakes in its handling of these negotiations. But this is no excuse for Parliament to compound these errors.MPs should reject these amendments today and the House of Lords should respect the will of the elected House of Commons when the bill returns to it.Then, the Government should get its act together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Brexit that leaves it half in, half out and subject to EU rules it has no say over would be a disaster but that’s what seeking a deal at any price will lead to.As one of Britain’s many friends abroad, please accept my assurance that you don’t need a customs union to prosper.Without being in a customs union with Europe, and without any free trade deal with it, Australia does nearly $100billion a year in trade with Europe.In the two years of my prime minister-ship, Australia finalised free trade deals with our three biggest export markets: China, Japan and South Korea.So my advice to Britain is: Stop fretting! It IS possible to trade successfully under the WTO rules which already govern 55 per cent of Britain’s exports and it IS possible to do good deals with your main trading partners once you are free to do so, as Australia’s experience abundantly demonstrates.Let’s say, out of spite, the EU refuses to offer Britain a satisfactory bargain.Britain already imports goods from Europe free of tariffs and quotas. Britain already recognises European standards and credentials. Just declare that you will continue to do so.Trade from Europe to Britain would be absolutely free. And even if the Europeans — in an attempt to hurt Britain that would actually damage them — apply the same tariffs to Britain as they do to the US, the fall in the Pound would make British exports at least as competitive in Europe as they are now.Britain should still be the best place from which to export to Europe or to service Europe — because it has the freest markets, a can-do culture and will no longer have EU officials trying to harmonise away its competitive advantage.No new Brussels directives will apply in the UK. British courts will no longer be subject to European ones. And Britain need no longer admit everyone with an EU passport.Importantly, Britain will be able to strike trade deals with anyone it chooses without waiting for 27 other countries to sign up too.The coming Britain-Australia Free Trade Agreement should mean a dramatic increase in trade opportunities between our two countries without disadvantaging anyone else.First, there should be no tariffs or quotas on any goods traded between our two countries — there should be no exceptions, no carve outs, nothing. And second, there should be full recognition of each country’s credentials and standards.Because Australia and Britain are like-minded countries with similar systems and comparable standards of living, there should be no need for tortuous negotiation and labyrinthine detail.After all, Brit and Australian workers enjoy similar protections in the workplace: So why should they need elaborate protections against each other?Britain and Australia have comparable attitudes to job qualifications and product and service standards, so why should British rules be insufficient for Australia and vice versa?And Britons and Australians already have more than 200 years’ experience of each other, so why not allow them more freely to travel and work in each other’s country?This could be a template for the trade deals Britain could swiftly do with New Zealand and Singapore.On a similar basis, Britain could seek to join NAFTA, (North American Free Trade Agreement) which could become the North Atlantic Free Trade Area — and perhaps open to other free market economies seeking to escape the regulatory restraints and statism of the EU.Brexit could begin a process leading to genuinely freer global trade, rather than protectionist trade blocs.Brexit is a wonderful opportunity for Britain and the wider world — if only British leaders are prepared to make the most of it.So go for it Britain, for all our sakes!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An endless, choking diet of documentaries, live events, lectures, news items and outright bollockings, from the BBC, all to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.Not one of which had as much impact as Love Island’s “Girl Power” task on ITV2, involving super-hero capes, bikinis, large items of fruit and narrator Iain Stirling explaining: “The girls will squish melons with their bums. Slowest girl to crush her melon is out of the contest.”Just part of the reason I adore a show which pricks pomposity and political correctness like ­nothing else on British television and is dedicated to no other purpose than entertaining its viewers. That’s the ideal, anyway.The reality’s been a bit more disappointing, so far, probably due to the excessive hype and sense of deja vu with contestants on either half of the gender divide.Both operate a squad rotation system, of course, but among the main players on the blokes’ side, we have painfully shy ­doctor Alex, with all the presence of a fire extinguisher, Jack who “got his teeth in Turkey”, possibly by ripping them from a feral mountain goat’s mouth, and this year’s comedy figure Niall, who’s “an investment for the future”, a bit like Betamax video tapes, and “multi-layered”, like a landfill site.There’s the compulsory personal trainer, as well, of course — Adam, who seems to have the run of the females, plus strong silent type Wes and fluffy-haired Eyal, pronounced “Eeeeh-al”, “Oooh-all”, or just “Aaaah-sole”, if you prefer.Quite the ­profound one, is Eyal, forever banging on about “auras” and his spirituality while insisting: “I want to find someone here with depth.”A claim which, surely, represents the very height of human optimism given the most profound question all of the girls were asking last week was: “Where’s your head at?”In Kendall’s case, it was “literally all over the place”. One of her eyes was in Majorca, another in Ibiza and her ­forehead was somewhere in the Cote d’Azur. She’s gone though now, leaving, among significant others: Samira, Georgia, Rosie, super- manipulative Hayley and Laura, a former air stewardess who’s ­covered in more make-up than the giraffe in a theatre ­production of The Lion King.Most of the hype, however, has centred around the ­presence of Dani Dyer, the daughter of EastEnders actor Danny Dyer. But you knew that already, didn’t you, possibly because you read it in the paper and possibly because you saw her perform exactly the same big reveal on ITV2’s Survival Of The Fittest a couple of months ago. A doubling up that blows my mind, frankly.Because you expect hit shows to be copied by other fringe channels.What you don’t expect is ITV2 to abuse the basic law of ­supply and demand by copying its own format. A move that doesn’t help Love Island at all. It stops it being an event, in fact, and just makes viewers think this sort of crap is on all year.Personally, I think that’s a shame. Love Island genuinely deserves to be a huge success again. Not only is it one of the funniest and most UN-PC shows on TV, it’s also a series that can actually make you feel glad to be old and half-crippled by your medical complaints, rather than the youthful insecurity and stupidity which has gripped this bunch, who really did surpass themselves, on Friday.Georgia: “What do you think of Brexit?”Hayley: “What’s that?”“We’re leaving the EU so things like welfare and, like, things we trade with would all be cut down.”“So that means we wouldn’t have any trees?”“Cheese?” “No, trees.” “Oh.”Emmeline Pankhurst, your work here on Earth was not in vain.(Love Island, ITV2, 9pm).HAVING discovered Danny Dyer is the rightful heir to the English throne, BBC1 really should’ve knocked it on the head with Who Do You Think You Are?Until such time as one of the researchers can prove Danniella Westbrook is the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty and the Imperial Highness of all Russia.So they must have been flipping cartwheels at HQ when they discovered the great-great-grandmother of this week’s guest, ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan had her birth certificate signed by registrar Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes.A much greater honour, in the Beeb’s book, than three wise men and some shepherds turning up at your crib, but a detail that was probably as dull as ditch water for most viewers.The far more interesting thing to emerge during the hour, I thought, was Michelle’s own staggering ignorance of life, the world and everything.She had, for instance, no idea where Genoa was and gave a genuinely staggering response when a local historian told her: “By 1940 your family will have been torn apart, like every other family in Gibraltar, at the time.”“Why?”(Pause) “The Second World War.”You wondered then if the show would ever get round to revealing if the plank gene had entered her family tree through the maternal or paternal line.Then Michelle Skyped her mum and, waving a frothy cup of coffee at the screen, said: “Guess where I am. I’ll give you a clue, I’m drinking a cappuccino . . . ”“France?”Mystery solved.Loose Women, Russell Brand, with Janet Street-Porter: “Everyone is so beautiful here.”Good Morning Britain, roly-poly Piers Morgan: “When I grew up, I loved Frosties and it never did me any harm.”And Love Island, Samira: “I can sing, I can dance, I can act.” (Bursts into song).She can’t sing.NEVER, in all its ten-series history, has ITV’s love lift been quite as badly needed as it was on Saturday’s brilliant, one-off Take Me Out special for the “over-50s”.A slightly generous description, I thought, given the 30 game old birds looked like they had the combined age of the Pyramids.The fire still burns down below, though, evidently, as a queue of lights remained on for George, the midget Zumba teacher with the wooden teeth, Lawrence, the Billy Connolly lookalike from Ibiza, and even “bouncing Bill”, the ex-policeman, above, who emerged from Paddy McGuinness’s love lift gasping for breath and telling the women: “Every night, when I go to sleep, I like to think I’ve made someone’s life better. What would your motto be?”Fingers crossed, I’d imagine.Lee Dixon: “I like Alexander-Arnold because he gives you half a goal.”Ian Wright: “Harry Kane is still getting back to where he is.”And Glenn Hoddle: “By the time the World Cup starts, today will be history.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In 1883 which luxury train service ran between Paris and the city now called Istanbul?” Alice: “The Eurostar.”Ben Shephard: “The former Labour MP Ed Balls married which politician in 1998?” Phil: “Theresa May.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The plumage of what flightless bird was used as a medieval helmet decoration?” Geoff: “Eagle.”And Ben Shepherd: “How many of the eight planets in our solar system have the letter A in their name?”Harj: “I think the answer to that is one.

Led by Caroline Flint, the Brexit-backing MPs have sent a stinging letter to Jeremy Corbyn urging him not to bow to pressure from pro-EU colleagues.EEA membership gives countries such as Norway and Liechtenstein access to the single market, but they have to accept unlimited EU immigration and EU rules and regulations. Jeremy Corbyn wants his MPs to back separate Labour plans for a bespoke Brexit deal that would guarantee the UK full access to the single market.But leading Labour backbenchers including Chuka Umunna, Mary Creagh and Chris Leslie, are among the 70 expected to defy him.The tension on the Labour benches erupted on Sunday when Mr Leslie had a bitter TV dust-up with Brexit-backing Caroline Flint.After saying Ms Flint of sounding like arch Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg, she accused him of sounding “desperate”. Ms Flint - a former Labour Europe Minister - was one of a cluster of Labour MPs from Leave constituencies urging Jeremy Corbyn not to bow to pressure from Europhiles.In the letter, the MPs, including Gareth Snell, said backing EEA membership would force the UK to continue to accept unlimited EU migration. Another split emerged as the TSSA Union became the first Labour affiliated union to call for a referendum on the Brexit deal agreed with Brussels.One source told The Sun: “The party is split two to three ways. And it’s great fun for the Corbynistas – they’re watching the MPs who wanted him out scrapping with each other.”Sir Keir Starmer met a group of Europhile Labour MPs before he addressed the full Labour Parliamentary Party.One insider said he hinted Labour could move closer to backing EEA membership next month when both the Government’s Customs and Trade Bills go before the Commons.The UK Chamber of Shipping urged MPs to reject any Norway-style deal.The trade body said: “We cannot allow the UK to become the only major economy in the world to have no say in the rules and regulations its economy lives.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tory Remainer delivered a rousing speech warning her parliamentary colleagues that it was time to stand up and be true to what they believe in. Ms Soubry, who has led campaigns to stay in the EU, spoke to those MPs who have approached her in quiet and dark corridors to praise her and other Tory Brexit rebels. The Conservative former minister also called out businesses who express concerns about leaving the EU in private but won\u0027t speak in public.  And she warned about the dangerous turn the debate over Brexit has taken speaking about death threats she has received and the fears of a colleague who had to attend a public engagement with six armed under cover police officers.  She said: I am getting a little tired of honorable members and right honorable members on the backbenches, in government, even in the cabinet who come up to me and others in quiet and dark corridors to British businesses who demand private meetings where they lay bare their despair but refuse to go public, to the commentators who say to me \u0027you\u0027re doing a great job keep on going\u0027 in the face of death threats which mean that one of our number had to attend a public engagement with six armed under cover police officers. In a passionate intervention she said: That is the country we have created and it\u0027s got to stop. To the journalists who fight nobly for every cause but on this most important of issue are mute. It\u0027s got to stop. Everybody now has to stand up and be true to what they believe in.  MPs were stunned by Ms Soubry\u0027s passionate intervention.  Labour\u0027s Wes Streeting tweeted: I don’t care what anyone says,  Anna_Soubry is made of steel. Powerful speech in defence of Parliament and democracy.

The amendment to her flagship EU Withdrawal Bill would have let MPs block us from leaving the EU without a deal. But MPs voted down the plan tonight after a furious campaign by the government. Theresa May only managed to win the vote after issuing a last-minute compromise to buy off rebellious Tories. So who did actually vote for a meaningful vote on Brexit in the end? And how many Tories rebelled? Search for your local MP below.  Tonight\u0027s vote is one of 15 on the EU Withdrawal Bill. It killed off plans to give MPs a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in Autumn 2018 on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal. The plan would have given Parliament a specific power to decide what happens next MPs reject her agreement with Brussels. MPs could have forced her back to the negotiating table, for example, instead of crashing out with no deal. Backers insisted they wouldn\u0027t use it to \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 - but that\u0027s exactly what Leavers feared would happen. So Solicitor General Robert Buckland bought off Tory rebels by promising to meet them - and dropping a huge hint he\u0027d accept their pleas. Mr Buckland said he was particularly interested in a compromise that was put forward by Remain-backing Tory MP Mr Grieve. Under the compromise plan, Theresa May would be forced to let MPs vote on her final Brexit deal this autumn. But if talks are still deadlocked she would have until 30 November 2018 to make a formal statement on what to do next. Search for how your MP voted here   How did Tory MPs vote? Tory MPs voted AGAINST a meaningful vote. But 2 rebelled against the party line to back it. Tory rebels Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry voted to give parliament a meaningful vote. How did Labour MPs vote? Labour MPs voted FOR a meaningful vote. But 5 rebelled against the party line. Ronnie Campbell, Frank Field, Kate Hoey, John Mann, Graham Stringer plus suspended Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins, who sits as an independent, voted against giving Parliament a meaningful vote. What if my MP did not vote? There were 12 MPs from the main parties who did not vote, six from the Labour benches, five Tories and one Lib Dems. For those MPs who \u0027did not vote\u0027, some abstain deliberately - but not all. Sometimes illness or personal reasons can be blamed for them not turning up. MPs have to turn up to the House of Commons in person to vote. So if they can\u0027t, often they \u0027pair\u0027 off with an MP in another party who agrees not to vote too. This, however, doesn\u0027t show up in the system. All these reasons mean it\u0027s not always well-advised to harangue your MP for not voting on a particular day. There could be a very good reason. MPs are holding a marathon two-day voting session on June 12-13 on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - the law that enacts Brexit. Theresa May wants MPs to overturn 15 amendments, passed by the House of Lords, that would push Britain towards a much softer Brexit. It could make or break her premiership so she\u0027s been pleading for Tory Remain-backers not to vote against the government. But it\u0027s going to be massively confusing. To help you follow the drama, here\u0027s a summary of the original 15 Lords amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - and what they would achieve if they pass.  Meaningful vote*: Would give MPs a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in Autumn 2018 on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal. This would give Parliament a specific power to decide what happens next if her deal is rejected. MPs could force her back to the negotiating table, for example, instead of crashing out with no deal. Backers insist they wouldn\u0027t use it to \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 - but that\u0027s exactly what Leavers fear will happen. (49, 19) Customs Union: Would force Tory ministers to take steps towards staying in an EU Customs Union - by making a statement on how they\u0027d do it. This could stop Britain from striking trade deals around the world - but would prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland and keep free trade with the EU. (1, 1) Single market: Would force the Tory government to keep Britain in the European Economic Area (EEA) - which practically means keeping membership of the single market, and following nearly all its rules. This would likely continue free movement between Britain and the EU - almost as we see it today. (110A, 51) Brexit Day: Would remove the legal date of Brexit - 29 March 2019 - to let ministers change the date at the last minute if they don\u0027t have a deal. Leavers also fear this could be a tool to delay Brexit indefinitely. (95, 37) Northern Ireland*: Would give added protection to the Northern Ireland border - forcing ministers to obey the Good Friday Agreement, and keep the province in an EU customs union if it stops a hard border. (88, 25) Henry VIII powers 1: Would block Tory ministers from changing EU laws on several issues - employment, equality, health and safety, environmental or consumer rights - without enhanced scrutiny by MPs. (11, 4) Henry VIII powers 2: Would block ministers having a wide-ranging power to decide when EU laws can be challenged after Brexit. (18, 52) Henry VIII powers 3: Limits ministers\u0027 power to change law without a vote - they\u0027d only be able to do it if necessary, instead of if appropriate. (31, 10) Henry VIII powers 4: Would give a \u0027sifting committee\u0027 of MPs the power to insist Parliament gets a vote on legal changes. (70, 110) Refugees\u0027 rights*: Would continue refugees\u0027 rights to be reunited with their families in the UK under the EU\u0027s Dublin Regulation. (59, 24) Citizens\u0027 EU legal rights*: People could continue suing the government in UK courts for breaching general principles of EU law. (19, 53) Charter of Fundamental Rights: Would ensure the vast majority of the EU\u0027s Charter stays in UK law. (15, 5) Theresa May\u0027s mandate: Would force the PM to get MPs\u0027 approval for her \u0027mandate\u0027 for Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU. (51, 20) Future EU laws: Would let ministers copy and paste new EU laws into UK law after Brexit, and carry on taking part in EU agencies. (93, 32) Protecting the environment: Would block ministers from using Brexit to water down any protections for the environment. (1, 3)  For geeks, each amendment\u0027s \u0027number\u0027 is in brackets. As if it wasn\u0027t confusing enough, each one gets \u0027renumbered\u0027 so we\u0027ve included both numbers - the old number, followed by the new number. Some of the above will be overturned, some could pass if there\u0027s a Tory rebellion. Four we\u0027ve marked with asterixes (*) - these are ones where the government has offered a compromise to get them through."},{"url":null,"title":"mps laugh idea eu dont","story":"NewsMPs explode with laughter at idea the EU don\u0027t know the Tory cabinet is divided over BrexitVeteran Tory Ken Clarke said it was \"ridiculous\" to suggest that voting to give parliament a meaningful vote undermined the Prime Minister\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent15:25, 12 JUN 2018Updated15:27, 12 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMPs exploded with laughter as veteran Europhile Tory Ken Clarke mocked the idea the EU don\u0027t know the cabinet is divided.  He was speaking to urge the Commons to vote for an amendment on the EU Withdrawal bill which would give give MPs a so-called meaningful vote on the final deal.  Mr Clarke dismissed the idea that this would undermine Theresa May\u0027s position. He told MPs: The argument that we\u0027re undermining the Prime Minister\u0027s position in the negotiations is equally ridiculous. It is based on the proposition that out there on the continent they don\u0027t know there are divisions in the cabinet and they don\u0027t know what the situation is here in the House of Commons.  And were a whisper to get out with some slightly unusual votes in the House of Commons this would undermine my right honourable friend\u0027s position [David Davis] and that of the Prime Minister and make it much weaker for them. The Commons erupted into laughter at the MP for Rushcliffe\u0027s intervention. And he continued by suggesting that the continent is utterly bewildered by the Anglo Saxons, they have no idea what we think we\u0027re doing. And he hit out at the real zealots in this house who he accused of trying to stop this parliament playing any part in the process which is totally unacceptable. One of the Lords amendments that MPs will be voting on this afternoon is one which gives Parliament extensive powers to direct ministers how to proceed in the event of no deal or if a deal with Brussels is rejected by MPs.   The government opposes the amendment and Brexit Secretary David Davis earlier dismissed it as a no Brexit amendment - quoting comments made by Crossbench peer Lord Bilimoria in the House of Lords.  But the Government fears losing a vote on the amendment. Attempting to avoid losing the vote, which would prove humiliating, ministers have tabled a compromise amendment which would see a minister come to the House within 28 days of a deal being rejected to tell MPs what will happen next.  But the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve has moved an amendment insisting on a binding Commons motion.

But it ended in a sickening story of violence and death deep in the South American jungle. A cult leader who once preached peace and equality and railed against the violence of the global nuclear arms race now urged his followers towards death. Jim Jones was found shot in the head lying among the bodies of 909 followers - including women and babies. The 1978 mass suicide was the largest ever single loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act, and remained so until the 9/11 terror attacks.  Followers of Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, better known as Jonestown, had committed mass suicide. Earlier other cult members had butchered congressman Leo Ryan, in an act that Jones ordered, after he arrived in north Guyana to investigate claims people had been held against their will. He had met disciples who begged for his help amid lack of food and a dictatorship regime. Jones feared he was about to be exposed and so ordered Ryan\u0027s death, with several of his entourage also killed. The cult leader then set in motion the plans for mass suicide he had long anticipated. He called his adopted son, also called Jim, at the cult HQ in Georgetown, the largest nearby city, and gave him an order with a terrifying secret meaning.  In a new documentary he recalls: In the early evening I went down to the radio room because my father wanted to talk to me. He says, \u0027We\u0027re going to meet Mr. Fraser\u0027. And that was code for committing revolutionary suicide, and \u0027you need to work out how you guys can meet Mr. Fraser in Georgetown\u0027. I\u0027m like, \u0027What the hell is going on, is there something else we can do?\u0027 Then my father went into a rhetoric: \u0027This is the cause that you have to stand up to, our avenging angels will protect us, and prove things right or make justice happen, but we have to meet Mr. Fraser.\u0027 Terrified about what was happening, Jim and his brothers went to the American Embassy to raise the alarm - but it was already too late. Back at the camp Jones had called a large meeting at the town\u0027s pavilion using the speaker system he often gave propaganda laden speeches over. Deadly cocktail  Meanwhile a cocktail of sedatives and cyanide  had been mixed by 30-year-old camp doctor Lawrence Schacht and flavoured with powdered grape juice flavouring.  The phrase Drinking the Kool-Aid was later born from the Jonestown suicides to mean a person or group who goes along with a doomed or dangerous idea because of peer pressure. The assembled were told it was time to die. The first to take the poison were Ruletta Paul and her one-year-old son Robert. A syringe with its needle removed was used to squirt poison into the infant\u0027s mouth, after which Paul squirted another syringe into her own mouth. Jones ordered mothers with babies to take the poison first and it\u0027s been speculated that it was to make adults more willing to die after their children were dead.  One eye-witness stated that while the poison was squirted in some children\u0027s mouths, there was no panic or emotional outburst and the assembled Temple members looked like they were in a trance. This though was contradicted when a 45 minute audio recording - known as the death tape - emerged revealing cries and screams of children. On the tape Jones could be heard ranting: I tell you, I don\u0027t care how many screams you hear, I don\u0027t care how many anguished cries...death is a million times preferable to 10 more days of this life. If you knew what was ahead of you – if you knew what was ahead of you, you\u0027d be glad to be stepping over tonight. Humble beginnings The cult leader had begun as an American evangelical preacher who was certain the Cold War of the 1970s would bring a nuclear bomb. He created a community in San Francisco, California, where he said his followers would be safe from nuclear fallout. Many of his followers were recovering drug addicts from the black community and he seemed to offer a warm welcome at a time when racial divides were strong. But the authorities started to pay extra interest to his community - called the People\u0027s Temple - and there were stories in the press from disaffected former members of the church. Then almost overnight Jones relocated to Guyana, in South America. Followers - to whom he preached about communism, socialism, the US government, the rich, economic equality and ending childhood hunger- believed he had special powers and followed him to the new planned utopia  One member of the cult who survived the massacre with his children, Jerry Parks, recalled a car journey when what he thought at the time was a miracle happened. He said: My son Dale was driving to school with Jim Jones with two or three cars. The lead car which he was in hit a duck and knocked it to the side of the highway. Jim had him pull over, open the door, got out, walked over and picked the duck up in his hand and Dale says he stroked the duck. Miracle He said he was saying something but he didn\u0027t understand what he was saying and all of a sudden the duck jumps up to his feet on the hand and flies away. That is something to this day we don\u0027t understand how to view it, what to think about it, was it real, was the duck alive, would it have happened anyway? We didn\u0027t think that way at the time, because it was too early on with Jim Jones so we believed that it was the real thing. Jerry says now that he never fully bought into Jones\u0027 hyperbole and suspected disaster was on the horizon the moment he landed in South America.  He said: I knew early on that we were going to die over there. He had backed himself into a corner that he couldn\u0027t get out of and it would soon fall in on him. He said we may have to die for this. But he didn\u0027t mean we\u0027re going to grab guns and stand out there and protect ourselves. \u0027You have to die for it\u0027 means we\u0027re gonna kill ourselves before they get us. New start In South America in the baking heat Jones and his followers built a town housing 1,000 - mainly women and children. But it was not to be a peaceful life as quickly his methods of controlling a community containing those who had begun to doubt their mission became increasingly cruel and driven by paranoia. Residents had their passports collected on arrival and any dissent was treated with brutal beatings or menial tasks as punishment. Members of the cult were forced to sign confessions to theft, abuse and terrorism as a sign of loyalty but in reality they were used to keep the members quiet. Former member Joyce Shaw told the Mirror in 1978 that Jones imposed celibacy on members, telling them he was the only heterosexual in the world but slept with both men and women. Shaw, who had been a member in the US, said: I saw beatings and physical abuse. For discipline people were publicly spanked or beaten with thick sticks. A man who confessed to being a homosexual was stripped, beaten with a rubber hose and made to march around to show his welts.  You could see that he could no longer have functioned as a man. Another man who complained about the celibacy rule was forced to perform humiliating acts in public with a woman who vomited over him. That cured his ardour. Little kids who misbehaved had to box each other, so did elderly people. Word began to leak back to the USA that some residents were being held against their will in the community - which was known as Jonestown - and relatives lobbied their elected representatives for help. Paranoia Jones believed the American Government had it in for him and was terrified he would lose control, so he ordered his brainwashed followers to conduct drills in preparation for a mass suicide. Then, in November 1978, Congressman Leo Ryan decided to visit the community after his interest became aroused when the son of a friend who was a member of the cult was found murdered days after saying he wanted to leave. It was to begin the ball rolling towards a tragic conclusion. By the time Ryan arrived on November 14, Jones\u0027 health had declined, according to survivors, and he was abusing LSD, Quaaludes, stimulants and barbiturates. His once sharp speaking voice was slurred, his eyes were glazed and he was increasingly paranoid. Ambush Ryan was initially refused entry to the town but once inside he was treated to a well-rehearsed musical show designed to show all was happy and well. In fact it would later emerge he had told an aide that he planned to report all was well upon his return to the US. Jones, though, had already decided on his deadly course. Inside the camp several unhappy families approached Ryan asking to come with him when he left, but the numbers were still small in relation to the overall population. On the evening of November 18 the departing Ryan party - along with 30 defectors - assembled at the nearby Port Kaituma airstrip to fly back to Georgetown. They had been joined by Temple loyalist Larry Layton despite the concerns of those leaving who did not trust him.  As the party waited at the airstrip a tractor and trailer appeared and hidden gunmen opened fire - Congressman Ryan, two reporters and an NBC cameraman were killed along with defector Patricia Parks, while several other people were also injured. Congressman Ryan was shot more than 20 times. Jerry Parks was at the airstrip when the shooting happened and recalls in a new Investigation: Discover documentary: I had just fastened my seatbelt and was siting right by the window and I heard the guns going off and the bullets flying and all I could think to say was \u0027my God!\u0027 I heard my mom holler \u0027look at Patty\u0027, my wife. I looked back and she was sat slumped over with the top of her head gone. Larry Layton had shot two people inside the plane but when he tried to shoot Jerry\u0027s son Dale, the gun jammed. The gunmen fled after killing the Congressman and the survivors hid in the jungle until help arrived.  Back at the camp Jones used news of Ryan\u0027s death to speed up the mass suicide telling his followers: The Congressman’s dead … please get us some medication. It’s simple, it’s simple, there’s no convulsions with it, it’s just simple, just please get it before it’s too late. The GDF (Guyana Defense Force) will be here. I tell you get moving, get moving, get moving … The poison took just five minutes to kill. When the army arrived they found a scene of unimaginable devastation with bodies littering the ground around the pavilion. A handful of cult members survived by fleeing into the jungle or hiding. Grover Davis, 79, who was partly deaf, missed the announcement to assemble on the loudspeaker, lay down in a ditch, and pretended to be dead. The children A first body count put the death toll at 400. Only when the bodies were moved was it discovered that children and babies had been murdered and their bodies lay hidden beneath the adult corpses. Plastic cups, Flavor Aid packets, and syringes, some with needles and some without, littered the area where the bodies were found. Jones\u0027 body was found with a self inflicted gunshot to the head. At the cult\u0027s headquarters in Georgetown, cult member Sharon Amos cut the throats of two of her own children and then killed herself.

Several students were reduced to tears in an advanced cognitive and biological psychology exam on Wednesday, May 30 after the topic they were told to revise didn\u0027t come up in the paper. Split in to two halves, the first half of the exam had four potential topics but only three questions. Meaning one of the topics would not appear.   A student, who wished to remain anonymous, contacted Somerset Live about the exam and explained that they had been told to revise at least two topics as a safety buffer.  However, he added that a member of university staff made matters more complicated. He said: Apparently a member of staff gave out a hint in a seminar that the sleep topic was definitely going to come up. “I did not hear this directly but the people that did only revised sleep, despite lecturers definitely saying to revise two topics.  He added: “Before the exam started there was lots of commotion as people made jokes about leaving the exam if the sleep topic wasn’t there. “But these jokes soon turned to tears for a lot of people when the paper was turned over and sleep was not on it. These tears resulted in a \u0027disturbance\u0027 during the exam, with many people choosing to get up and walk out. Because of this the university has offered students the chance to re-take the paper. The offer was made in an email sent round by Executive Dean, Andy Salmon.   In the email, he said: As you are aware we have investigated a number of complaints about the Advanced Cognitive \u0026amp Biological Psychology .    Following this investigation we decided that we would provide students who feel their exam was disrupted, with an extraordinary opt-in opportunity to resit this exam.

Tina Cantello, 49, was reported missing by her family when she failed to return home from her door-to-door job with Provident cash loans. Her mobile phone was found abandoned at the side of the road and her body later discovered in Langdon Hills, Essex. Geoffrey Hutton, 38, was arrested by detectives and charged with Tina’s murder on Monday night. He appeared before magistrates in Basildon, Essex, today accused of stabbing the mum-of-two to death.  Wearing a bright red jumper and a heavy medical bandage on his left arm, he spoke only to confirm his name and will appear at Chelmsford Crown Court on Wednesday. According to Hutton\u0027s LinkedIn profile, he worked for the Ministry of Justice from 2001 to 2010. His Facebook profile states he is now employed as a finance officer with Ford.  No details on the case were heard beyond him being charged with one count of murder which took place at some point between June 7 and 10. Chair of the magistrates bench Paul Fisher declined jurisdiction on the case and said: We have no power to do anything today apart from remand you in custody to Chelmsford Crown Court where you will appear tomorrow. Mrs Cantello\u0027s mobile phone was found abandoned at the side of the road with her distraught family describing the disappearance as 100 per cent out of character.  A missing person\u0027s appeal was launched but then suspended 24 hours later when her body was found about two miles from where she was last seen in Basildon, Essex. Police later revealed Mrs Cantello died of multiple stab wounds to the chest. A spokesman for Essex Police confirmed: A post mortem examination was carried out and established that she died from multiple stab wounds to the chest.

Helen Wright was diagnosed in July 2017 after a year of increased shaking and weakness which left her struggling to change nappies or undo her bra strap. The 34-year-old fell pregnant in February 2016 and started to experience symptoms of the debilitating illness three months later - but excused them as normal. After Helen gave birth to George, now 18 months, her symptoms worsened and husband Chris, 34, urged her to go to the doctor. The primary school teacher admits after receiving the shock diagnosis she worried about how she would look after her boys - and feared she would not get to see them grow up.  Helen, from Penkridge, Staffordshire, said: I found out I had Parkinson\u0027s in a phone call when I was looking after the boys at home. I had no idea what to say to the neurologist. I was completely speechless. The thought that ran through my head was, \u0027Oh my god, I\u0027m going to die.\u0027 My visions of Parkinson\u0027s were of old men shaking and struggling to move. My husband was in an important meeting but came straight home when I called him. I was in floods of tears. For a whole week I didn\u0027t stop crying. I kept thinking about what might happen to me and how well I would be able to look after the boys. I had no idea Parkinson\u0027s was something you could get when you were young and it was horrible to think I\u0027d have to live with the condition.  Helen began to develop a tremor in her left hand while three months pregnant with her second son George. The expectant mum put the symptom down to exhaustion from being pregnant while caring for her eldest son, three-year-old Oliver. But her condition only worsened after George\u0027s birth. After a visit to her GP in December 2016, Helen was referred to a neurologist and after eight months was given the diagnosis. Helen said: It was shortly after I fell pregnant with George I started to get a tremor in my left hand. I was also exhausted, but then I was looking after a one-year-old toddler and teaching primary school at the same time so I didn\u0027t think much of it. But after I gave birth to George the tremor didn\u0027t go away as expected. My husband noticed it was getting worse and happening more often so I went to go and get it checked out. In January 2017 I was referred to a neurologist at Stafford County Hospital and was referred on to Royal Stoke Hospital for DAT and MRI scans. It was a huge shock when the diagnosis came through.  Despite receiving the diagnosis at a young age while bringing up two young sons, Helen is determined not to let the condition affect her. The mum-of-two is still teaching at a primary school two days a week as she did before her pregnancy and is only taking a very low dose of medication. Helen said: Fortunately early onset Parkinson\u0027s can be quite slow to develop so I know I have plenty of time. My Parkinson\u0027s nurse is fantastic and she has done so much to help me understand the condition and that it is something you can live with. Sometimes my husband and I completely forget I have it and the children don\u0027t know. I can be holding a glass of wine and the rings will rattle against it when my hand shakes and Chris can tell me to stop making the noise. It\u0027s only then that I\u0027ll have to remind him I can\u0027t. Obviously when the boys grow older they\u0027ll realise what I have and it might be harder for me to be a more active mum, but for now it\u0027s not holding me back at all. I\u0027m living life to the full and I have a wonderful family to help and support me.

Jack Renshaw, 23, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, bought a Gladius Machete to kill Rosie Cooper last summer. On the opening day of his trial, Renshaw pleaded guilty to preparing acts of terrorism as well as making a threat to kill police officer Victoria Henderson. Judge Mr Justice Jay directed the jury to deliver a formal guilty verdict on the first two charges Renshaw faces. He is on trial alongside Christopher Lythgoe, 32, from Warrington, who denies giving Renshaw permission to murder the West Lancashire MP on behalf of National Action on July 1 last year. The pair, along with Garron Helm, 24, of Seaforth, Merseyside, Matthew Hankinson, 24, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, Andrew Clarke, 33, and Michal Trubini, 35, both of Warrington, also deny membership of the banned far-right group.  Opening the trial, prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC said: This case concerns these defendants and their support for, involvement in and membership of the proscribed racist neo-Nazi group National Action. He said Renshaw planned to carry out a politically and racially motivated murder in support of National Action. They were done with the blessing of his leader, Lythgoe, jurors heard. He told jurors the group had engaged in a campaign of virulent anti-Semitic and homophobic propaganda since 2013. It tried to recruit and radicalise young people through violent images and hate-filled language, he said. Its support for the murder of MP Jo Cox in June 2016 led to it being banned, Mr Atkinson said. But he said the defendants remained active members of the organisation after it was proscribed. Mr Atkinson said evidence would come from a disenchanted former member of National Action, Robbie Mullen, who passed information to Hope Not Hate.  The court heard that the defendants were part of the North West area branch of National Action which met at the Friar Penketh pub in Warrington. Lythgoe resolved to continue National Action after the ban, saying in an e-mail last December: Long term we\u0027ll keep moving forward just as we have been. We are just shedding one skin for another. Mr Atkinson said Renshaw\u0027s threat of violence was personal as well as political. It began with his arrest in January last year on suspicion of stirring up racial hatred in two anti-Semitic speeches in Blackpool and at the Yorkshire Forum for Nationalists. He was interviewed by Detective Constable Victoria Henderson and another officer before being released on bail. An analysis of his phone revealed what police considered evidence of child sex offences and he was interviewed again by DC Henderson, jurors heard. On July 1 last year, Renshaw revealed his murderous plan to National Action members at a meeting in the Friar Penketh, the court heard.

The author, clearly with their knickers in a twist, blasted mum Claire Mountjoy and implied tourists would be upset by the sight of her family\u0027s laundry. They claimed to speak on behalf of local businesses and the East Devon neighbourhood, and suggested using a tumble dryer instead. But the townsfolk of Colyton have made it clear the mystery sender is nothing to do with them at all - and now they\u0027re rebelling in the most hilarious way - even creating pant bunting.  Claire, an Education Officer for Devon Wildlife Trust, is a firm believer that the spirit of the Monmouth Rebellion still runs strong in the veins of the residents. And now the Laundry Revolution is under way as homes and shops across the town now proudly sport lines of pants and socks in defiance.

A yellow warning has been issued for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and northern England between 3am and 3pm on Thursday. Heavy downpours and gusts of up to 70mph have been forecast as wet and windy lows from the Atlantic shake things up and drag wild weather towards the British Isles. The Met Office said the \u0027danger to life\u0027 warning is due to large waves in coastal regions and flying debris from the high winds. The weather warning reads: A very windy spell will develop during Wednesday night in association with a deep area of low pressure.  The strongest winds will reach the west coast during the early hours of Thursday before spreading eastwards during the day. Westerly winds are likely to gust between 50 and 60mph in many areas and possibly around 70mph in some exposed locations. Winds should gradually ease from the west during Thursday afternoon. In addition, a spell of heavy rain will accompany the wind with the highest rainfall totals over parts of western Scotland.    Conditions will turn much cooler and fresher from today, with strong winds and risk of gales by Thursday - especially across the northern half of Britain. Sarah Sammy, forecaster for The Weather Channel, said: Around mid-week, low pressure is expected to move in from the Atlantic bringing more persistent showery rain to Ireland at first and Britain later on. “Maximum temperatures will be generally 15-20C in the north and 19-23C in the south. “Later in the week it will be slightly cooler and more like 15-18C in the north and 18-21C in the south.” While there are no warnings in place in the south or in Wales, rain and wind are expected.  Charles Powell, press officer for the Met Office, said more stable conditions will return later in the month. “On Thursday, we’ll see some pretty wet and windy weather working its way through from the Atlantic.“From the 20th June onwards there’s a sign that we might start to see things becoming a bit more settled again, a bit drier.” Elsewhere, temperatures will tumble back down towards normal for the time of year further south, with some good spells of sunshine.

The third sighting of the year of the legendary monster has been accepted by the official Nessie register. Natalie Hodgson and her family, on holiday from Yorkshire, took a picture of what they believe to be the head of the creature in the water at 10.30pm on June 1. The \u0027creature\u0027 remained for a few minutes caught in the moonlight before disappearing. The sighting by the family who were staying at the Highland Lodges holiday park at the time follows a remarkable, feature film length video of the Loch Ness Monster shot by a Nessie watcher from Ireland on April 30. Hospital clerical worker Eoin O\u0027Faodhagain from Donegal took a ten minute video from the Loch Ness webcam. The creature moves from right to left and as it swam towards Urquhart Bay - a favourite haunt of Nessie - and is seen diving and surfacing with water splashes. DNA sampling is currently being used to discover previously unrecorded organisms in Loch Ness.  However Prof Neil Gemmell, a New Zealand scientist leading the project, said he did not believe in Nessie, but was confident of finding genetic codes for other creatures. Prof Gemmell of New Zealand\u0027s University of Otago said a biological explanation might be found to explain some of the stories about the Loch Ness Monster. A global team of scientists, known as the Super Natural History team, will use environmental DNA sampling of the waters to identify tiny DNA remnants left behind by life in the Highlands loch. They will then establish a detailed list of all life living in Loch Ness and make comparisons between it and several other lochs to find if it differs from other sites. As creatures move through the loch, they leave tiny fragments of DNA through their skin, scales, feathers, fur, faeces and urine. Prof Gemmell said: Large fish like catfish and sturgeons have been suggested as possible explanations for the monster myth and we can very much test that idea and others.  While the prospect of looking for evidence of the Loch Ness monster is the hook to this project, there is an extraordinary amount of new knowledge that we will gain from the work about organisms that inhabit Loch Ness - the UK\u0027s largest freshwater body. Gary Campbell, Keeper of the Official Register of Sightings at Loch Ness, said the recent sightings showed the enduring unexplained appeal of Nessie. He said the latest sighting was the first of the monster in the moonlight. I know of no other of Nessie in the moonlight. The photograph was taken by the 11-year-old girl in the family, said Mr Campbell. It is unexplained. Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster set new global records last year. Nessie\u0027s 11 accepted sightings in 2017 were the highest this century. The Loch Ness Monster has certainly coined it in for the Highlands.

Dentists in Mexico stumbled across the mystery circular mark when the 47-year-old patient went for a routine check-up.  Flummoxed by the mark, the dentist at the School of Dentistry at the Universidad de Montemorelos proceeded to question the patient about its cause.  The medic then agreed that the red skin, known as erythema, was likely to have been caused by the patient performing too much oral sex. Upon questioning, the man revealed he is sexually active with men and regularly performs oral sex, with the last occasion taking place just three days before his dental visit.  However the mark was symptomless and the patient was completely unaware of its existence prior to his dental visit. Medical professionals wrote about the case in a prestigious medical journal and warned other dentists to be on the lookout for such marks. Writing in the BMJ Case Reports, they explained how the red lesion appeared. The dentists wrote: The contact of the palate with the penile glands may cause a haematoma due to blunt trauma.

Ashleigh Bates discovered the tragic creature when he noticed an ewe having difficulty while giving birth. He said: Our property is on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, and at lambing time we check our ewes every day to see if any of them need help. It is a big job as we have 5000 ewes lambing and this ewe I found was obviously in trouble, with only the head showing. I pulled the lamb and found the conjoined twin.  While it\u0027s a remarkably rare occurrence, conjoined twins do occur among both livestock and humans. Ashleigh said: It\u0027s very rare. I am 65 years old and have been farming for 50 years, and I have never come across it before. The ewe was fine but of course the lamb didn\u0027t survive, being born dead. We have lots of ewes that need help and this was so unusual which is why I photographed it.

I’ve been experiencing a high volume of emails and calls regarding complaints about the services.“The public pay their council tax and expect the bins to get emptied.“You used to have the issues with tenements having multiple wheelie bins out on the street. At the moment it is turning into a city-wide issue.“People are doing the hokey cokey with their bins.”Resident Raymond Dunsmuir, 51, said this was the “worst disruption” he had seen to the waste collection service since moving back to the area in 1996.He said: “I contacted the council last Friday and they said the collection was running late.“We never had any issues like this before the changes – it’s just been a shambles.“The grass and other garden waste is going mulchy and creating a smell.“As far as I’m concerned the delays in collections are down to cutbacks in the staffing levels.“I feel sorry for the team members who are getting over-stretched with the work they are doing.”Another resident said he believed that although council tax is going up, the service is getting worse.He said: “The area is stinking at the moment because the waste hasn’t been uplifted.“The reason for this has to be as a result of cutbacks.“I honestly feel the council tax keeps going up and the service is going in the opposite direction.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said the local authority is dealing with an “exceptional” amount of green waste this year resulting from a wet spring followed by a sustained period of warm weather.He said: “There was a near-40% rise in green waste delivered to the Riverside composting site in May compared to the same period last year.“We are dealing with a situation where many homes in Dundee have multiple brown bins.“Additional resources are being deployed to catch up with collections. In the meantime residents are asked to leave bins out and they will be uplifted.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee face competition from motherwell in bid bring simon murray back to dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee face competition if they are to make a move to bring striker Simon Murray back to Dens Park.Murray spent the second half of last season on loan at the Dark Blues from parent club Hibs and said he was open to a return – but only if the Edinburgh side went with another striking option.His first choice was to try to prove himself at Easter Road after an up-and- down debut campaign there.Whether he has the chance to do that is up in the air after Motherwell moved to take him to Fir Park.The Steelmen have reportedly had a bid of £50,000 turned down by Hibs for the striker as they look to add to their attack.And that’s unlikely to be the end of any interest in the 26-year-old with ’Well expected to continue their pursuit.A number of European clubs have also been keeping tabs on him since his Dundee United days.The Tangerines, too, have made advances to bring him back to Tannadice.The lure of a return to boyhood heroes Dundee on a permanent basis would be big for Murray, though whether manager Neil McCann is prepared to splash cash on the former-Arbroath man remains to be seen.In 14 games for the Dark Blues last season, Murray managed just the three goals despite some good performances. Gaffer Neil suggested Murray was just trying too hard to shine in front of his fellow-Dundee supporters and was happy with his contribution.The Dee boss is desperate to add more threat to his side and

shoplifting.Mervyn said he has lived a “lucky” life but, upon retirement, decided to trace his family history. He has uncovered ties to Dundee and is appealing to anyone who may have known his mother, whose birth certificate he has not found.He believes his mum, Irene Miller or Millar, was born in Canada but grew up and worked in Dundee. Mervyn thinks his maternal grandmother travelled to Canada while pregnant, but returned to Scotland shortly afterwards.He has found a cousin, Freda, and an uncle, Raymond, who live in Dundee, but neither has been able to shed much light on the mystery. Freda’s mum also lived in Dundee and Mervyn suspects she and his mum would have hung about together.He said: “It would be a great satisfaction to know what happened to her. We just can’t find a birth certificate. In a jute mill or other factory, everyone knows everyone so there might be someone in Dundee who knew my mother.”Irene ended up in Liverpool working as a prostitute but that is where the trail goes cold.His father is even more of a mystery, but as Mervyn is mixed-race he believes a man from Pakistan, India or Sri Lanka came to Dundee for the jute industry.Born with spina bifida, Mervyn spent much of his childhood at a children’s centre in Edinburgh.

He was a great size, very athletic and a really good shot-stopper, great at one-on-ones and his distribution was excellent, too.“With Jon McLaughlin leaving I thought it would be the ideal chance for Craig Levein to put Jack in for pre-season.“He’s moved on, though, and Dundee have a great signing.“I worked with Jack, he’s a great lad and really down to earth personality.“I think it’s a great bit of business by Neil McCann.“He’s a good age with plenty of experience as well at Hearts and all the different levels with Scotland.“It’s a massive signing for Dundee – he could be there for years to come.“He will have to bide his time, though, because Elliott Parish did really well at the end of last season after Scott Bain left.“Every goalie is going to have times when it’s not going for you but Elliott got through that and didn’t do a lot wrong. He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1e51507a3be-564x564.jpg ","title":"james mcpake hopes to plunder us for new dundee fc talent","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are planning to plunder the United States for top young talent to bolster their improving youth set-up.The Dundee Juniors of Central Texas has been a project running since American owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms took control of the club.The set-up in Austin has been steadily growing and Dark Blues coach and former skipper James McPake is out there right now working with the youngsters.Speaking to the Tele, McPake admits he’ll be “outside his comfort zone” as he puts the kids through their paces in the strong Texan sun.He is tasked with heading a training camp over there as well as picking out some players good enough to come across and join his U/18 squad over in Dundee.He said: “Last year I spent some time over here with Tim Keyes and John Nelms just having a look at things.“The club have held camps over here every year, certainly since Tim and John have been at the club.“This time it’s a bit different because it’s an ID camp – I’ll be doing some training sessions and, hopefully, we can pick a couple to come across to Dundee and train with our U/18s.“I went last year just to have a look at what goes on but this time I’ll be coaching.“The facilities are great over there, too, it’s a great place to go to – though I’ll be needing to put on factor 500 with the heat!“We’ll be coaching in about 42 degrees instead of the minus two at Riverside with the wind in your face.”It might seem strange to some to see a whole squad of youngsters all training in Dundee kit in the middle of Texas but McPake is delighted to help “spread the name” of the club as much as possible.“The kids are all kitted out in Dundee gear and they love it,” he added.“Being part of a big club like Dundee is something they really enjoy and the club have done it really well.

I’ll be out of my comfort zone and that’ll be a challenge.“Last year, we went and watched some of the age groups in training and I was really impressed with the standard of players.“As a coach, its great to work with kids like this because they are so keen to learn.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"local actor and director to bring acclaimed show to dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFife-born actor, director and musician Cora Bissett is bringing her latest production to Dundee.Bissett will direct a new production of Gagarin Way at Dundee Rep Theatre between October 16 and November 3.Set in Fife, Gagarin Way addresses the departure of socialist values from a region where political radicalism was once the cornerstone of the community.The play was written by Gregory Burke and first appeared in a theatre in 2001.It follows disillusioned computer factory workers Eddie and Gary who have a plan to make the ultimate political statement — kidnap a member of senior management and send a message to the world.Their plot starts to unravel when security guard Tom stumbles in on them.Worse still, the kidnapping hasn’t quite gone to plan.Gagarin Way is described as offering a stark insight into the harshest realities of Scottish society, tempered with fiery black humour.Among the venues to have hosted productions of the play are the National Theatre and the West End in London.Bissett is best known for her musical Glasgow Girls, which followed a group of activists that took up an ethical fight against the deportation of asylum seekers who had settled in Scotland.She is also recognised for writing the music for the stage version of Emma Donoghue’s book Room and in 2014 she became a part-time associate director at the National Theatre of Scotland.For tickets and more information about the play, visit dundeerep.Doors for some performances open at 2.30pm, while others are at 7.30pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17b6e6b90a2.jpg ","title":"manchester united boss jose mourinho watches dundees former arsenal midfielder glen kamara amid transfer speculation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJose Mourinho was watching as Dundee’s Glen Kamara picked up his fourth international cap in Finland’s friendly defeat in Romania.The 22-year-old has drawn plenty of interest in his time at the Dark Blues – Mourinho, however, was only there as a guest of Romanian agent Ioan Becali and stressed in an ad-hoc TV interview he wasn’t looking at players, just enjoying his time off.Kamara, meanwhile, despite only joining up with the Finnish national squad on Monday, played the majority of the second half in Ploiesti.The Finns, ranked 62nd in the world and not at this year’s World Cup, started the friendly match well but fell behind in the first half to Cristean Manea’s 37th-minute strike.In the second period, Kamara made his entrance after 57 minutes for Nottingham Forest’s Thomas Lam but almost immediately the team fell further behind.On 61 minutes, winger Ciprian Deac finished from close range to give the Romanians a home victory.Finland boss Markku Kanerva said: “The start was challenging but we looked good.

Inverness","story":"\u0026nbspONCE-in-a-lifetime plans to transform eyesore buildings in the heart of Inverness into a major attraction will take several years to come to fruition, with discussions yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years. That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Tuesday 12 Jun 2018 7:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111987.jpg","title":"British Empire Medal recipient honoured","story":"\u0026nbspAN Inverness man has been honoured to celebrate 50 years of volunteering with the RAF Association.John Maclean (83), who was born in Inverness but now lives in Peterhead and is chairman of the association\u0027 branch in the town, has been giving up his time to help others since the end of his active service in the 1960s.He also served in a number of senior roles in the organisation, and now his efforts have been recognised after he was awarded the British Empire Medal.Mr Maclean said: \"It\u0027 nice to have your hard work recognised.\"I took out life membership when I was leaving the air force in 1966 and soon after I started volunteering with the association.\"It becomes like a big family.

The retired training aircraft is now only usually flown for the owner himself or his friends and associates.Tracking Yusuf down through a Facebook appeal, Mr Gibbs was impressed by his enthusiasm when they finally met.\"He goes out in all weathers and in all seasons \u0026ndash this boy is keen, just like I was,\" he said.\"I made contact and offered to get them airside and show them around the hangar, with particular emphasis on his favourite machine, the Jet Provost.\"A former Highland Airways and Flybe captain, Mr Gibbs now works on contract in China but lives near Dalcross.

But a story like that is so dramatic that surely it would have passed down through the family.\"Mr Newton managed to track down the woman by following clues from sources such as reports of the fire in newspapers including the Inverness Courier, plus help from the family historian at the Highland Archive Centre.Having identified the butchers A\u0026ampD Macdonald, along with the location of the family farm in Glenmoriston, he subsequently discovered the great-granddaughter of Alexander Macdonald had married in Dundee in 2009 but was living in America.\"I do get a bit obsessive when it comes to researching local history,\" he conceded. \"It takes on a life of its own.\"It is like being part historian and part detective.

It will also incorporate the North tower, which has been open to the public as a viewing platform for more than a year and Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.Locals and tourists can also look forward to new galleries which will host national and international exhibitions, displays celebrating the creativity and beauty of the Highlands as well as \"retail and catering\" which showcase the best of what the region has to offer.\u0026nbspA new hotel could also be created as part of the makeover.The project is to be part-funded by \u0026pound1.5 million from the \u0026pound15 million Scottish Government contribution to the Inverness-Highland City-Region Deal.The remainder will involve hefty borrowing by the council although it said it would benefit from the rents of the various businesses in the existing buildings.Speaking at the castle Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing, co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment, said the investment would support economic growth and create a \"sustainable, viable and must-see attraction to celebrate the spirit of the Highlands\".He added: \"It will create a once in a generation opportunity for future redevelopment for the city and the Highlands to create something of high architectural value \u0026ndash precisely the opposite of the existing buildings.\"Equally thrilled council leader Margaret Davidson said: \"This has been a long-held ambition.\"It will help us achieve our vision for this iconic site and Inverness Castle\u0027 place as part of a range of tourism assets this region has to offer.\"Highland planning director Stuart Black confirmed the purchase price was \"over \u0026pound5 million\", adding: \"We\u0026rsquore still in final discussions with the owner but it will be agreed by the end of June and then we\u0026rsquoll release the purchase price.\"He said the options for the site were to renovate, to redevelop partially \u0026ndash perhaps by removing the upper deck \u0026ndash or what he termed \"comprehensive redevelopment\".Project manager Graham Watson, of High Life Highland, said: \"It\u0027 a one-off opportunity for Inverness to really look at how it see its future for Castlehill.\"The attraction envisaged for the castle will promote the Highlands\u0027 \"creativity, wellbeing, culture, heritage and natural environment\".Tuesday 12 Jun 2018 7:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04043000/04043681.jpg","title":"Yellow peril told to look the other way","story":"\u0026nbspTRAFFIC wardens have been ordered not to slap fines on motorists in an Inverness\u0026nbspstreet \u0026ndash because the parking signs are invalid and council workers are too busy fixing potholes to find time to take them down.The \"yellow peril\" has been instructed to turn a blind eye on Greig Street until a maintenance team can get round to putting up correct signage.The move has left B\u0026ampB owners scratching their heads wondering how they can convince their guests to ignore the signs and assure them they will not get a ticket.\"Surely the council can do better than that,\" said Acer Glen Guest House owner Stephen Bowsher.\"I can quite believe they\u0026rsquore busy fixing potholes but are they really expecting me to turn around to a guest and say \u0026lsquoI know what the signs say but that\u0027 OK, you can just ignore it?

At its peak there were 2,500 workers on site.A new campaign called GoNorthEast is also set to promote safety ahead of the bypass opening.Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work Keith Brown said: “We estimate there will be 80 less accidents a year, one of which would be fatal – so there are huge benefits to the local area.“We’re looking towards completion around October/November this year. If we can do it earlier than that, we will.“But we need to do this in a safe way. That’s important for this huge project which has had one or two issues, such as Storm Frank, which set it back by a few months.“Of course we’ve had the collapse of Carillion which has meant that some other projects on this scale have been mothballed or delayed substantially.“But what we’re seeing now is this road going ahead, with big parts of it almost ready for cars to go on to.“We need to do this in a safe way. People have been waiting 60 to 70 years for this project.“We do acknowledge, of course, the disruption that’s been there but this will be a fantastic addition to the roads network.“It’ll make transport in this area safer and it’ll make it greener.”Chief Inspector of road policing in the north of Scotland Stewart Mackie added: “When the road opens it will be one of the safest in the country. We will have police patrols on the road as well.“It’s new, so we want to encourage people to take their time and take care until they get to know it.”Emma Bellu, chief executive of safety charity Absafe, praised the project’s aim to reduce road accidents by around 80 per year.“Communities in the north-east have long awaited improvements to the local road network that can reduce the injury toll on our roads,” she said.“Using the latest in safe road design, the AWPR/B-T will improve safety and reduce accidents by taking traffic away from unsuitable rural roads and urban areas.“This will make journeys safer and less stressful for drivers and give streets back to their communities.“This project can quite literally save lives, reduce injuries and improve wellbeing and we welcome the celebration in the run-up to the official opening.”Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: “A fully operational AWPR will be a huge boost to our area.“Forecasts suggest the economic benefit it will bring to the regional economy is in excess of £6 billion over the next three decades as well as providing a platform for the creation of 14,000 new jobs.“In addition to improving the quality of life for our residents – a major factor in economic development – faster journey times and improved north to south connectivity will increase business productivity and help us to secure the next tranche of investment we need to deliver our renaissance region vision.”As revealed in later editions of yesterday’s Evening Express, project bosses have said that following the completion of the route in the River Dee valley there will be a weekend of community events on September 8-9.Attractions will include a travel through the ages showcase, with a display of vintage vehicles.There will also be the chance for cyclists to travel along the stretch in the area prior to its opening – which they will not be able to do afterwards.Mr Brown added: “We will be involving businesses as well to make sure they’re aware of the benefits that arise from the opening of the new road.“It’s about the local community. This is their road.“It’s been built for their benefit, for individuals and businesses.“They are the people who have paid for it. The taxpayers paid for this road so I think they are entitled to feel a part of it through education initiatives, competitions and business events.“We want communities to take ownership of this road.“We estimate around £6bn of economic benefit to the north-east in the opening of this road over a 30-year period.”\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/5b1f636d3e6c6-860x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeens newton dee to feature in tv show tonight1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA documentary about a north-east village where people with learning disabilities live and work is to be shown on TV.The programme, called Village of Dreams, will focus on Newton Dee and will air tonight.More than 80 adults with learning disabilities, autism and Down’s Syndrome live at the Camphill Community Campus site, which opened in Bieldside in 1960.There are also a variety of on-site enterprises, such as a toy shop, bakery and metal workshop which the adults work in, with all of the items created sold in the stores and online.A crew from Hopscotch Films spent a year at the village filming everyday life for the BBC documentary, which encompasses how the residents live and work.Jake Vollrath, long-term co-worker at Newton Dee, said: “They started filming almost exactly one year ago.“The film company actually contacted us which was quite nice.“Someone working there had grown up near to Aberdeen.“She had come to the cafe and the store when she was younger and kind of had a rough idea of what we were about.“We were initially a bit nervous and unsure.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"springwatch spotlight on tarbert","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/06/18, 12:17 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert has featured on the popular BBC nature show Springwatch.An underwater segment stirred up a buzz on social media with its inside look at the colourful world just beneath the waves.Diver and cameraman Andy Jackson took to the bottom of Loch Fyne to view what he called ‘an underwater garden’ and the wonderful creatures within.The segment was aired on Tuesday June 5 and is available on BBC iPlayer for a limited period.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

She died because there was no match, but I signed up because of her.\u0026#8217Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.The identity of recipient and donor must be kept confidential for two years, to protect them both, but the pair exchanged cards, giving Brett and David the chance to learn a bit about each other.Then, on Sunday June 3, the long-awaited meeting took place in Campbeltown.Brett continued: \u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met. I was a little bit lost for words but I gave David a hug and shook hands and said thank you. We had a lovely evening together with our families and the kids played together, which was great.\u0026#8216Without David, my kids would have grown up without a father.\u0026#8216The first couple of minutes were a little bit overwhelming because there was so much anticipation,\u0026#8217 said David .\u0026#8216Our kids got along really well and I see us becoming friends rather than anyone feeling like they owe us something,\u0026#8217 he continued.David now works for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) and is involved in its partnership with Anthony Nolan, which has now recruited more than 10,000 potential donors.Amy Bartlett, regional development manager for Scotland said: \u0026#8216The SFRS and Anthony Nolan partnership has already resulted in 28 people donating stem cells but Brett and David are the first pair who have been able to meet, so it’s an exciting moment.\u0026#8216I would encourage anyone who is aged 16-30 and in good health to consider joining the register and visit anthonynolan.org/join.

They’re celebrating 20 years since leaving school with a party at the Marine Hotel. And organisers are hoping Ayrshire Post readers can track down some pupils they cannot find. The group all started in 1992 and would have all left by 1998. Joint organiser Lynda Hardman said: “We’ve managed to make contact with a lot of them but some are missing. “It’s been 20 years since we left school and I thought a wee reunion would be a good excuse to get together and have a fun night with good food, friends and some old classic 90s tunes.  “We want a night to reconnect and reminisce.” They are also calling on any teachers of the era who could face meeting up with some of their young charges again. They have booked the Marine Hotel on Saturday, July 28 and ex-pupil and DJ Steven James will spin the decks. Lynda added: “Many people have their tickets already, some who live locally like Vicki Cameron, some from a bit further afield, like Ed and Kim Wood (Carmichael) and others are travelling from outside Scotland like Hannah Izod (Green) who now lives in England, Neil Lockie of Florida and John Brisco in Hong Kong.” Tickets costing \u0026pound25 include three-course meal and welcome drink and can be bought at the website marr92 and Lynda and fellow organiser Mhairi Lammie were on the yearbook committee of the time and are seeking photos for a slide show to be sent to atreunion1992@outlook "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12662348.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/lhr_ayp_010618dom.jpg","title":"prestwick tennis superstar learning disability","story":"NewsPrestwick tennis superstar with learning disability climbed Goat Fell for charityDominic Iannotti, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet14:45, 7 JUN 2018NewsDominic Iannotti Prestwick Tennis player (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRising tennis star Dominic Iannotti made a mountain of cash by climbing Goat Fell. The 20-year-old from Prestwick, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran. Dominic was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum, at a young age and is part of the Great Britain Learning Disability tennis team. After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall. He is currently part of an apprenticeship at Prestwick Tennis Fitness Club and is close to achieving his level three coaching badges that would allow him to coach anywhere in the world. Dominic’s dad, Anthony, who runs the Iannotti Bros cash and carry, could not be more proud of him. The 50-year-old, from Prestwick, said: “Dominic was diagnosed at a young age. We tried all kinds of things but nothing seemed to help. “My wife went online and found children’s charity Bibic and we spoke to them. They were a godsend and they guided us and helped Dominic through a lot.    Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors. We wanted to help Bibic as they were instrumental in helping the way Dominic is today and SAAS helped Dominic from a very young age.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"punjab pakora ayr up national","story":"NewsPunjab Pakora in Ayr up for national awardIt follows success in Scotland in December when the Ayr firm scooped the Business of the Year award at the Scottish Asian Business of the Year.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston16:28, 12 JUN 2018NewsVinita and Kushal Duggal of Punjab Pakora Ltd (Image: Euan McCall/Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCurry kings Punjab Pakora are now up for a UK award.

last year proved a runaway success with many of the days completely selling out.\n\u0026ldquoIt really is a fantastic opportunity to step back in time and enjoy a relaxing day out to the Scottish Borders, taking in the spectacular scenery and discover two of Scotland\u0026rsquos great scenic rail journeys.\n\u0026ldquoWithout a doubt, passengers are in for an unforgettable day out \u0026ndash they can sit back and relax and take in the picturesque beauty of the Fife coast, the iconic Edinburgh Waverley station, with plenty to see and do when they arrive in the Scottish Borders \u0026ndash all topped off with quality local food and drink.\n\u0026ldquoThe return of the steam train experience provides an important boost to the local economy and continues to shine the spotlight on the quality of tourism offering in these regions.\nThe special steam excursions will operate on every Sunday in August, departing from Linlithgow and cross the Forth Rail Bridge, before travelling onto Kinghorn, Burntisland and Aberdour.\nAfter stopping at Dalgety Bay, the journey continues south over the Bridge once again to Edinburgh then along the 31-mile route of the Borders Railway to Galashiels and Tweedbank.\nPassengers will be able to enjoy more than two hours in the Borders before the return journey, with additional trips to Melrose, Galashiels, Abbotsford House and local restaurants also available.\nScottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos executive member for business, councillor Mark Rowley, added: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to work alongside SRPS and our Borders Railway Blueprint partners to bring back the steam train experience in 2018 after a hugely successful 2017.\n\u0026ldquoThe fact that all four trips were sold out \u0026ndash bringing 1,600 people to the Scottish Borders \u0026ndash was testament to the offering by SRPS, which included spending the afternoon in our wonderful area with plenty to see and do, and quality local food and drink available.\n\u0026ldquoI am sure that the 2018 steam train days out will be another fantastic occasion on one of Scotland\u0026rsquos great scenic rail journeys.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel =

Immediately Jewson Campbeltown chipped in for a couple, leaving 13 up for grabs.CDJFA said a small part of this will help towards the running costs of the festival. The remainder will purchase new equipment.In June 2012, what started out as a return exchange with Lochgilphead resulted in CDJFA\u0026#8217s idea for an annual football festival. Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter how dare you laugh","story":"Perhaps you shouldn’t read this. It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.

Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.

Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.

There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans.

Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

The students also heard presentations from Craig Bonnar of award-winning catering company and official racecourse supplier Heritage Portfolio Susan Manchester, general manager of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art cafes and Sarah Montgomery, the racecourse\u0026rsquos senior operations and commercial manager.  Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.

Developers have said the \u0026ldquounique development would challenge the perception of what a retirement scheme should be by offering a wide variety of modern facilities to encourage activity and foster a strong community.

Among the extensive list of on-site facilities, which will be used by both residents and the wider community, will be: a central two-storey clubhouse, tidal pools, spa facilities, a fitness suite, multi-use spaces for community events, a clinic, a contemporary restaurant, function suites and various shops.  The proposal will incorporate the very latest in information technology to provide the highest standard of support services for residents, said developers.  The project will be the most sustainable of its kind in Scotland, with a district energy centre and heating system to provide the most environmentally-friendly power at the lowest price.  A reservoir on the site dating back to 1850 will be incorporated into the overall development with plans to create walkways around the water feature, which will be stocked with trout for fishing.

Bursary support for the poorest young students in higher education will be increased from \u0026pound1,875 to \u0026pound2,000 a year.  Combined the two measures will benefit 13,500 students, she said.  Support for the poorest independent students will also rise from \u0026pound875 a year to \u0026pound1,000 benefiting nearly 18,000.  Bursary support in further education will also rise to up to \u0026pound4,500 a year, with all eligible students aged 18 and over receiving a guaranteed bursary award.  The minister was expanding on steps set out by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the SNP conference in Aberdeen at the weekend, including more than \u0026pound21 million of investment, an increase in the bursary for care-experienced students to \u0026pound8,100 and raising the repayment threshold for student loans to \u0026pound25,000.  Ms Somerville said: \"Any changes being introduced or considered are with the poorest students at the forefront of my thinking.  \"I want to ensure that any prospective student, regardless of their background, are equipped with what they need to fulfil their potential.\"  She said the government would further investigate other areas highlighted in a recent review, including support for students on benefits, part-time and disabled students and carers, with a forthcoming consultation.  Tory MSP Liz Smith pointed out that bursary support for the poorest students in higher education was \u0026pound2,640 in 2013.

I was playing football with a few of my friends at the local pitches. The rage that hit me as we were knocked out of the tournament was like never before. I can remember being so angry that I kicked the bags next to the goals containing our stuff, smashing a friend\u0026rsquos phone screen in the process. The rest of the boys were laughing as I was going ballistic and this was all over a game of football \u0026ndash I regret it to this day but looking back it was just what I\u0026rsquod needed.  I knew at this point that there was something wrong with me. For the rest of evening, I said nothing apart from apologising to my friend about his screen and offering to pay for a new one. I had never wanted to cry so much in my life but I held it together as I didn\u0026rsquot want to totally embarrass myself in front of my friends.  As soon as I got home, I rushed upstairs, avoiding any conversation with my family. I knew exactly the person to ring, my gran. She was the best listener anyone could have hoped for \u0026ndash always looking to help anybody out. I poured my heart out, told her every issue I\u0026rsquod ever had in the run up to this point whether it be substance abuse, entire summers spent solely in my room or the fact that my confidence with girls was at an all-time low. I didn\u0026rsquot particularly want to do anything or go anywhere, even pulling out of a boys\u0026rsquo holiday with some of my best friends.  I was spending days at school, working at McDonald\u0026rsquos at the weekends and not enjoying a single minute of it. Rejection from Heriot-Watt University. Rejection from IKEA looking to upgrade my part-time job made me feel like a total loser.  I\u0026rsquod been made Head Boy at Penicuik High School but felt like a below average student and kept saying that I\u0026rsquod been appointed because \u0026ldquothe staff felt sorry for me.  As I sat there, blubbing away, my gran told me to see a doctor. It was her that took me to my first doctor\u0026rsquos appointment and then counselling session. We\u0026rsquod had my future counsellor, obviously I didn\u0026rsquot know at the time, from MYPAS (Midlothian Young People\u0026rsquos Advice Service) speak to the school and I had previously put my name down on the sly but the doctor arranged an appointment sooner for me knowing that I was in trouble.  The counselling was great. It\u0026rsquos an experience that I went into with the most pessimistic approach possible. I couldn\u0026rsquot have seen how talking to a complete stranger who didn\u0026rsquot know me, my family, friends or girlfriend was in any way going to benefit me given she couldn\u0026rsquot put names to faces and wouldn\u0026rsquot know them if she bumped into them in the street. My counsellor, Angela Robb, was excellent and didn\u0026rsquot care about them, this was about me and what I was going through. I saw her for 12 sessions, because when I\u0026rsquod got to the end of my initial 10, I felt as though I wasn\u0026rsquot necessarily \u0026lsquothere\u0026rsquo yet so she was able to provide me with more sessions.  Robb said: \u0026ldquoCounselling is unique to each client and whilst there are some common factors in every therapeutic relationship, I tailor how I work, taking my lead from each person. It\u0026rsquos key to successful counselling to be able to form safe and trusting therapeutic relationships. I feel that I do this and my client\u0026rsquos outcomes and feedback suggest this is true.  But it was not only me going through such a horrendous ordeal. Some of the statistics and facts are alarming. According to menshealth, 9% of men go through depression on a daily basis, more than 6 million men. On top of that, 3 million men are hit with a form of anxiety every day.  Why is this the case? I spoke to Jane Anderson, a mental health nurse at Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline.  \u0026ldquoI have been a mental health nurse for eight years and have probably nursed hundreds of patients, some you\u0026rsquoll never see again and others I\u0026rsquove nursed several times. As difficult as it can be some days it is also very rewarding.  Anderson says: \u0026ldquoWe are a recovery focused ward and building a therapeutic relationship initially with patients can be challenging. However, when there is an understanding that our goals are the same \u0026ndash ie to get a better level of health and be discharged \u0026ndash working alongside a patient developing care plans to suit their individual needs and treating people with respect. I don\u0026rsquot expect thanks but even seeing someone smile when they have been so unwell is a fantastic feeling.  She said there was still an unwillingness among men to admit that they have a mental health issue. \u0026ldquoBy the time they are admitted either informally of formally [sectioned under the mental health act] there is some recognition from the person that they are unwell. In the community, however, stigma is still very prevalent. The perception that males are raised to be stoic, brave and strong further enforces this belief.  I asked her what factors could lead to compound mental health issues. \u0026ldquoLack of knowledge and understanding, embarrassment, feeling of failure, fear of letting others down and looking weak, Anderson said. \u0026ldquoThis can be a generational issue, older males are less likely to be open about their mental health, younger males are more open although don\u0026rsquot necessarily accept it.  Although there is more discussion of these issues in society than ever before, I began to wonder what more could be done to raise awareness. I asked Anderson if she felt that men could be reached by information during entertainment and sporting events.  She said: \u0026ldquoI suppose the \u0026lsquoproblem\u0026rsquo is that mental health isn\u0026rsquot a nice happy topic so would turn people off from watching. We live in a consumer society, happiness and laughter brings viewers and readers and makes money for the big television and media companies.  I\u0026rsquom a huge football fan and it amazes me when I see people literally living my dream who aren\u0026rsquot entirely satisfied and perhaps feel that they never will be. The cases in Scotland with David Cox of Cowdenbeath who was taunted by a rival fan, \u0026ldquoAway and hang yourself and do it right this time, and James Keatings (formerly of my beloved Heart of Midlothian) recently sharing his battles on Twitter despite playing for three of the country\u0026rsquos biggest clubs. Even a Barcelona academy graduate, Bojan Krkic, came out and said: \u0026ldquoI had anxiety attacks but no one wants to talk about that. Football\u0026rsquos not interested.  That speaks volumes to me about the prevalence of mental health problems. Krkic has graduated from one of the leading academies in world football, has played in several of Europe\u0026rsquos major leagues (Spain, Italy, England, Germany and the Netherlands) and has presumably amassed a healthy standard of living through an astronomical wage but still suffers.  It\u0027s not a new problem. Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, was said to have reportedly experienced severe depression and supposedly contemplated suicide, often weeping uncontrollably. A key figure in the scientific revolution, Sir Isaac Newton, was seemingly psychotic, and prone to dramatic mood swings with numerous authors suggesting he was bipolar or schizophrenic. Vincent Van Gogh, one of the most famous artists of all time, was another affected. His enthusiasm for art came along with his fast-paced painting followed by deep depression and an apparent bipolar disorder.  In more recent times, many in the entertainment industry have committed suicide due to mental health problems. Frightened Rabbit\u0027s singer Scott Hutchison and the actor Robin Williams are all examples of people who, seemingly with the world at their feet, who have taken their own lives. It should never have to be this way.  Some may see suicide as the brave way out but the most courageous act you can take if you are suffering is to do something about it yourself and surround yourself with a loving family, supportive friends and people that ultimately want to put you right.  And, please, please, get help.

New legislation being introduced to Holyrood would hand councils extra powers to prohibit parking on pavements and double parking.  Previous efforts to address the issue were held up by various complications, including whether the necessary powers were devolved to Scotland.  The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos wide-ranging Transport Bill also aims to give councils more flexibility in running bus services, through working with operators, local franchising or running services themselves.  It also allows for the creation of low emission zones \u0026ndash such as that proposed in Glasgow \u0026ndash which will be under civil rather than criminal enforcement.  Transport minister Humza Yousaf said the legislation would give local authorities a new model to revitalise bus services.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are also providing clearer options for authorities to pursue local franchising or provide services themselves in appropriate circumstances.  \"Beyond bus services, this Bill will allow for decriminalised enforcement of low emission zones, double parking and parking on pavements.  \"This will help transform our towns and cities into cleaner, more accessible and more pleasant spaces to travel and enjoy.  The new proposals would also strengthen the technology underpinning \u0026ldquosmart ticketing, which could eventually allow all journeys on Scotland\u0026rsquos bus, rail, ferry, subway and tram networks to be linked into one payment system.  But critics described the legislation as a \"missed opportunity\" \u0026ndash insisting many of the measures don\u0026rsquot go far enough.  Scottish Labour\u0027s Colin Smyth said the SNP\u0026rsquos plans would mean \"public ownership of bus routes can only happen in very restricted circumstances.  He said: \"This would leave local councils picking up the pieces, running the very few loss-making routes whilst transport tycoons line their pockets on the rest of the bus network.\"  Green MSP John Finnie said: \"While we are pleased the Bill includes provision for local authorities to provide their own bus routes in areas where communities have been left behind by private operators, it is disappointing that it does not allow for the re-regulation of buses so that local authorities can choose to bring all bus services under public ownership.  \"There\u0027s also not a single mention for trains. This was an opportunity for the government to pave the way for a public bid for the ScotRail franchise and disappointingly they haven\u0027t taken it.\"  Scottish Conservative Donald Cameron MSP said some of the proposals would \u0026ldquoexacerbate feelings that the Scottish Government has an anti-car agenda."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/610721.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Nae Guid Eneuch  Private schools shun Scots history for GCSEs","story":"              A recent BBC-comissioned YouGov survey shawed that aroon 61% o Scots got their sense o identity fae their kennin o the History o Scotland.

A major report on schools in the developed world said staff rotation in Japan and Korea helped spread innovative teaching techniques.  The OECD report also highlighted cash incentives as a way of attracting the best teachers to schools in deprived areas.  And there was a boost to the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos policy of giving more power to headteachers.  The Effective Teacher Policies report said letting schools hire staff - a key plank of Education Secretary John Swinney\u0026rsquos reforms - led to improvements in pupil performance.  The report said: \u0026ldquoCountries with strong centralised traditions of teacher management could consider creating a mobility requirement, such as exists in Japan and Korea.  \u0026ldquoToo limited mobility of teachers between schools ... can hinder the spread of new ideas and approaches.  \u0026ldquoBy introducing a requirement for teacher mobility every five to seven years might stimulate continuous professional growth while also ensuring that effective teachers are fairly distributed across schools.  The report said opponents of school autonomy often voiced concerns that greater independence would lead to an education system that exacerbated economic and social inequities.  But it added: \u0026ldquoIn fact, many countries have been able to combine extensive autonomy with strong incentives to ensure schools prioritise student learning.  \u0026ldquoIf school leaders have some freedom to adapt teachers\u0026rsquo responsibilities, working conditions and pay to reflect the difficulty of tasks, they are better able to attract the most talented teachers to the most challenging classrooms.  \u0026ldquoOn average increases in school responsibility for selecting teachers for hire were associated with improvements in student achievement.  However, the report warned against giving more power to headteachers over hiring of staff too quickly.  \u0026ldquoSchool leaders\u0026rsquo capacity to manage human resources cannot be created overnight, it said.  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect, said moving teachers between schools could be disruptive for staff and children.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod prefer the priority to be making sure every school has the teachers it needs and that those teachers are of the highest calibre.  Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers\u0026rsquo Association, said the union would be interested in discussing the idea.  He said: \u0026ldquoTeachers should be encouraged to work across different schools to gain experience and pass on knowledge.  \u0026ldquoHowever, those who move across schools would need to be paid for the additional responsibilities and experience.  A spokesman for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union highlighted another of the report\u0027s findings - that countries which paid the highest salaries had fewer difficulties recruiting.  He said: \"Improving salaries is essential in making teaching a more attractive and desirable career option for highly qualified students.  \"In Scotland, teacher salaries have been eroded over the past decade.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said its education reforms were focused on giving schools and headteachers more power and money to raise standards.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are based on international evidence of how high-performing education systems work \u0026ndash delivering extra help for teachers in the classroom, more professional development and a stronger voice for parents and pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"Landmark surgery helps baby boy to reach his first birthday","story":"              Little Noah Connell\u0026rsquos parents were told several times that their baby boy was going to die.  With rare facial deformities which mean his life is at risk every day, the tot has undergone eight gruelling operations in his young life - including one surgery which was the first of its kind anywhere in the world.  Even swallowing his own saliva or a drop of rain could kill him, but against all odds the determined toddler has survived to celebrate his first birthday.  His parents, Jade Gordon, 19, and Kieran Connell, 17, said was a \u0026ldquomassive milestone for the whole family.  Miss Gordon, from Robroyston, Glasgow, said: \u0026ldquoWe were told on numerous occasions that Noah wasn\u0026rsquot going to make it.  \u0026ldquoFor anyone, their baby reaching one is a big deal, but it was a bit bigger for us because we have had so many hurdles to overcome.  \u0026ldquoHe had a birthday party with all our friends and family at a soft play area and then went to Blair Drummond Safari Park, who set up a special visit for us.  \u0026ldquoIt was really emotional, it\u0026rsquos amazing how much he has come on in the last year.  \u0026ldquoIt is a massive milestone for us and Noah. \u0026ldquo  Noah\u0026rsquos arrival into the world was a massive shock to his parents as Miss Gordon didn\u0026rsquot know she was pregnant.  She was suffering from bad stomach pains which turned out to be labour.  However, her surprise quickly gave way to worry as it became clear that something was wrong with the baby.  Doctors knew instantly that something was wrong with Noah, who was born \u0026ldquolooking like he had no jaw.  His condition, known as hemifacial microsomia, means the lower half of one side of the face is underdeveloped and does not grow normally.  He also has Pierre Robin syndrome \u0026ndash a congenital condition of facial abnormalities which causes problems in feeding and breathing.  He has a small neck, floppy airway and cleft palate and part of his spine is also missing.  The toddler\u0026rsquos condition is so severe that he cannot eat or drink because of the effect on his airway.  He is fed through a gastro tube and he can only have 620ml of a high-calorie solution every day to help him pile weight on and grow.  His mother explained that even being sick or swallowing a drop of rain could be enough to kill him.  She said: \u0026ldquoWhen he was born he looked like he had no jaw at all.  \u0026ldquoHe can\u0026rsquot eat or drink. Even one drop of rain could be fatal for him.  \u0026ldquoAnd we spend hours giving him a bath because it\u0026rsquos so dangerous.  \u0026ldquoLast weekend Noah was sick and choked He went purple and stopped breathing for between 10 and 30 seconds. We were blue-lighted to the hospital.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos scary but it\u0026rsquos just our normal - he is a happy wee boy.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know how to feed a baby or make a bottle up. But dealing with tubes and wires are all normal to us because we don\u0026rsquot know any other way.  However, the family still has hope that Noah\u0026rsquos miracle surgery will allow him to eat and drink normally in the future.  The life-saving operation took place at Glasgow\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Children on March 8 and involved metal rods being inserted to his tiny face to help secure the bones and allow him to breathe.  The surgery, called mandibular jaw distraction, saw doctors break his jaw in two places, with the rods being put in place to straighten his face and push his tongue forward.  It was so rare that surgeons had to send to Germany and the US for parts and consulted with other experts to decide if the operation was even possible.  It is hoped that the \u0026ldquoscaffolding will eventually move his jaw forward and help to reduce his chances of choking.  For three weeks after the surgery Miss Gordon and Mr Connell had to learn how to turn the screws in the metalwork \u0026ndash a process that has to be done with exact precision.  Jade, who cares full time for Noah, said: \u0026ldquoSince his surgery, his jaw has moved forward 4cm which should loosen up his airways.  \u0026ldquoThe surgery has worked as well as it can do just now and the movement in Noah\u0026rsquos jaw is a big improvement.  She added that both she and Mr Connell were shocked to learn that he could be the first person in the world to have the revolutionary surgery, but had no choice but to place their trust in the medical staff.  \u0026ldquoWe asked the doctors if we could see pictures from other surgeries like the one Noah was going to have, she said. \u0026ldquoBut they said they couldn\u0026rsquot.  \u0026ldquoWe couldn\u0026rsquot believe it when they said Noah would be the first baby in the world to have the operation.  \u0026ldquoIt was daunting to hear that but we trusted them.  Noah is now at home with his mother and father, who is a college student.  They say they are trying to \u0026ldquolive a normal life before the metal rods are taken out of his face next month."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7909504.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Scots give more than   1bn to charity in 2017 - but number of donors drops","story":"              SCOTS have given \u0026pound400 million\u0026nbspa year more to charity in 2017, even though there was a dip in the numbers feeling generous.  The latest report by the Charities Aid Foundation reveals that there has been a 50 per cent annual rise in donations to charity last year with the total given crashing through the \u0026pound1 billion barrier.  But the CAF said it was of \"some concern\" that there was a slight dip in the number of people giving money to charity year-on-year and that the rise is the result of the same number of people giving more, with the typical donation going up from \u0026pound36 in 2016 to \u0026pound60 in 2017.  It is believed the drop may be the result of a drop in trust in charities.  It comes as experts in the third sector earlier this year warned\u0026nbspin February that donations to Scottish charities could be damaged by the Oxfam sex scandal and public trust could be hit hard.  Oxfam workers in Haiti were accused of paying prostitutes and holding \u0026lsquoCaligula-style\u0026rsquo orgies, with participants allegedly including under-age girls, in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake there.  It was then\u0026nbspalso alleged that the charity knew about concerns over the behaviour of Oxfam\u0026rsquos country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, in a previous posting in Chad.    Figures released by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations in February showed that trust in charities had dropped by nine per cent over the last two years.  The SCVO findings prompted the group to launch a new campaign called I Love Charity, amid evidence that donations were being hit.  The CAF\u0026rsquos Scotland Giving report says Scotsgave an estimated \u0026pound1.2 billion to charity in 2017, up from the\u0026nbsp\u0026pound813 million donated in 2016.  It also said that in 2017, 63 per cent of Scots questioned claimed to have donated money to charity compared to 65 per cent in 2016.  The CAF survey report said: \"This leads to a key policy question about how to encourage giving and whether it should focus on getting more people to give or getting those who give to give more, or indeed, a combination of both.\"  Anna Fowlie, chief executive of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) said: \u0026ldquoThe findings from CAF\u0026rsquos report are fairly positive as they show that although the number of people giving has decreased, the amount of money being donated to charities in Scotland has gone up, which is great.  \"Figures released by SCVO in February 2018 showed that while trust in charities in Scotland is still high, it has dropped by nine per cent over the last two years, which may help explain why the number of people giving is down.    \"However our survey also showed that trust in local charities remains strong, particularly where people had personal experience of a charity, so it may be that the increase in giving is down to the impact of the good work organisations do in communities.  The Institute of Fundraising said the dip in donors may be because charities are focusing on giving \"existing supporters an even better experience\" instead of concentrating on attracting new supporters.  Alex Close, head of Scotland at the Institute of Fundraising, said \"We\u0026rsquore pleased to hear that the generosity of the Scottish public continues and it\u0026rsquos great to see a rise in the donation amounts that people in Scotland say that they have given.  \"The increase is likely to be caused by a combination of factors, rather than one single reason, including people feeling more financially secure, or a great experience with a charity that inspires them to increase their regular donation.    \"Many charities have been focusing even more on giving existing supporters a great donor experience and inspiring them to increase their regular donations. We hope that this generous trend continues and the Scottish public continue to give to good causes. \"  CAF found that Scotland accounts for 11.8 per cent of all UK charitable donations, despite representing 8.4 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos population.  It found that the most popular causes supported by those in Scotland were children and young people, with 28 per cent of those surveyed saying they had donated to this cause. This was followed by medical research (27 per cent) and animal welfare (25 per cent). The report also found that two in three (66 per cent) of people took part in a charitable or social activity, such as volunteering for a charity, donating money or goods, or buying an ethical product.  More than half (56 per cent) of those interviewed said they signed a petition in the previous 12 months, while 27 per cent had done so over the previous four weeks.  The report is based on a a survey of 1061 people in Scotland.    Sir John Low, Charities Aid Foundation chief executive said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to see the total amount donated increasing across Scotland. Activism is also on the rise, perhaps re\u0026#64258ecting the turbulent times in which we live. This paints a picture of a thriving, vibrant society of which we should all be proud.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos easy to take the work of our charities for granted \u0026ndash indeed CAF\u0026rsquos research over many years shows that millions of people benefit from their work without even realising it. But this report shows how much people value good causes. Without the support of these generous donors, we would all be so much the poorer."},{"url":null,"title":"Country walks  spas and fitness suites    welcome to the perfect place to retire","story":"              IT has been billed as Scotland\u0026rsquos first purpose-built retirement community and is predicted to change the way people live in their later years when the worries of work are behind them.  Plans have been unveiled for a new village designed to cater to the needs of the over-55s, with all amenities, facilities and services they require right on their doorsteps.  Developers say the \u0026pound55 million scheme, proposed for Netherplace reservoir in Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, would be based on a \u0026ldquovision of active later living, and would be self-contained and come complete with medical services, leisure facilities and shops within its environs.  And they hope it could become the blueprint for other communities across Scotland if it is given approval when it goes before the local authority for assent later this week.  The Netherplace Retirement Development is the brainchild of property developer Shazad Bakhsh and is being taken forward by the Glasgow and Singapore-based property company Scotsbridge Holdings.  It would see the construction of 252 homes on the 17-acre former industrial site, made up of one and two-bedroom flats and cottages alongside a central \u0026ldquoclubhouse.  It would also incorporate a clinic and an 80-bed care home, as well as a fitness suite, spa, restaurant, community spaces and country walks.  Investments would be made in the very latest in information technology to provide the highest standard of support services for residents.  Mr Bakhsh believes Netherplace could become one of the most innovative new communities for over-55s anywhere in the UK, and provide further inward investment to East Renfrewshire.  He said: \u0026ldquoNetherplace will be so much than a retirement development, it will create a vibrant new community.  Herald View: Older people need better housing options too  Scotland is facing a demographic time bomb in the coming decades, with the number of pensioners expected to soar by almost 30 per cent in the next 25 years to 1.36 million by 2039, according to official figures from the Registers of Scotland.  Meanwhile, the number of over-75s is predicted to rise from 430,000 to about 800,000, while the working population paying taxes to meet the growing cost of public services is predicted to grow by just one per cent.  This will inevitably greatly impact on council budgets and the public purse, but Mr Bakhsh said that similar retirement communities help councils shoulder the burden by having services grouped together.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe believe this project will ultimately reduce the burden on local authority care provision by providing residents with more intermediate care options.  \u0026ldquoThis is an opportunity to create a community in the truest sense of the word and tackle preconceptions of what a retirement development can be.  \u0026ldquoThe placement of these bespoke lifetime homes, with facilities which are second to none, will ensure a higher quality of living.  He added: \u0026ldquoOur professional and experienced team has a vision to modernise the sector and provide a development to both answer demand and exceed expectations.  Herald View: Older people need better housing options too  An independent economic impact study of the project estimates that the development will support more than 365 permanent jobs during the next 30 years, and contribute more than \u0026pound74m to the local economy .  It is also hoped that the purpose-built retirement community could help release much-needed housing stock elsewhere by allowing pensioners living in larger homes to downsize.  Netherplace reservoir, which dates back to 1850, will be incorporated into the overall design of the village and stocked with trout for fishing.  Demolition and clearance of the site, a former dye works which last operated in 2003, has already been completed to enable works to begin if planning permission is granted.  The development would be built across the road from Whitecraigs Rugby Club and immediately adjacent to the M77 motorway. A similar scheme was refused in 2015 amid objections from the community, social health and care partnership and Glasgow Airport.  Glasgow based practice Jewitt \u0026amp Wilkie Architects has been appointed to design the development. Founder Jonathan Jewitt said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove carried out thorough and extensive research on aspirational, high quality homes and engaged with numerous public and private bodies to achieve the optimum scheme proposal.  \u0026ldquoThis proposal includes a wide variety of unique features which have been subtly future-proofed to cater for the changing needs of residents.  \u0026ldquoIt is expected that housing currently occupied by one or two persons within the surrounding community will be released into the market for much-needed family housing."},{"url":null,"title":"Edinburgh wants to oust Sydney as best place to see in New Year","story":"              AS the first major city to welcome in the New Year, Sydney proudly boasts that it is hosts the most talked about party in the world.  But now organisers of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay event are gunning for the number one spot and hope to topple the Australian city from its perch.  The capital\u0026rsquos Hogmanay celebrations attracted 165,000 people last year, and had an economic impact of \u0026pound39 million, a new report states.  However, Underbelly, in its second year running the three-day event, wants Hogmanay to be the most talked about New Year celebration in the globe.  Around 10,000 more people, from 80 countries, attended the last Hogmanay event compared to 2017, and the organisers believe there still room for Edinburgh\u0026rsquos three-day New Year festival to grow.  Charlie Wood, director of Underbelly, said: \u0026ldquoOur plans aren\u0026rsquot about increasing that number of visitors, it is about increasing how Edinburgh and Scotland are viewed internationally.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about creating an event that is talked about, not just in the city, that notion of \u0026lsquoOh why wasn\u0026rsquot I there?\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos the goal, its about creating those images and stories, that really sell the city and the country internationally.  Underbelly said its own research shows that Hogmanay generated 37 TV news pieces reaching 89 million viewers, 201 radio pieces reaching 141 million listeners, and more than 2,000 online articles reaching more than 10 billion readers, with 360 pieces in print. These figures helped lift Edinburgh from the 17th most covered New Year event in 2017 to joint 7th this year.  However, the short term aim, Mr Wood said, is to break into the top five, with a long term aim of being the most-visible New Year event in the globe.  The research shows the top New Year celebrations being covered internationally are Sydney at no 1, followed by Seoul and Hong Kong at joint 2nd, followed by New York, Singapore, and Paris, and then London and Edinburgh at joint seventh, followed by Tokyo, and Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Moscow at joint 10th.  Mr Wood added: \u0026ldquoIt cannot be an exact science, but it helps build a picture about how the world looks at Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoAnd our goal is to make sure that it beats every other city in the world as the city that everyone talks about - which is creatively we try to make it as different as possible.  \u0026ldquoThe aim is to get images and stories, about Hogmanay and about Scotland, all around the world.  The economic impact figure is 40 per cent higher than the last measurement, in 2010, of \u0026pound27.9m.  The last Hogmanay was the first staged by Underbelly for the City of Edinburgh Council, after being run by Peter Irvine\u0026rsquos Unique Events for more than 20 years.  Ed Bartlam, co-director, said: \u0026ldquoWe didn\u0026rsquot set out to throw away what was already great about the event, we kept that, Peter Irvine did so much brilliant stuff, we just wanted to turn it up a notch, and that\u0026rsquos what we want to continue doing for the next few years.  Research conducted by BOP Consulting also surveyed 5,236 attendees and found that Hogmanay was the main or only reason for visiting Scotland for 71% of attendees from elsewhere in the world, 74% of whom were attending Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay for the first time.  Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay is principally funded by City of Edinburgh Council.  More than one-third of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay 2018 income came from public sector funding and 66% was from commercial sources of revenue including ticketing and sponsorship income.  Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted by the increased economic impact of the event on Edinburgh and Scotland to be an event that both encourages people to visit and creates employment in the city to have people from 80 countries buy tickets for the event but also see a strong local audience that engages and participates.  Ticket for Hogmanay 2019 are already on sale.  Councillor Donald Wilson, the culture convener for the City of Edinburgh Council, said: \u0026ldquoUnderbelly certainly didn\u0026rsquot fail to impress in their first year producing the event and this report highlights just how much of a success the festival was with a whopping estimated economic impact of \u0026pound39.8m for Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"TV classic Dad  39 s Army goes on stamps to celebrate show  39 s 50th anniversary","story":"              A new set of eight stamps is being issued to mark the 50th anniversary of TV comedy classic Dad\u0027s Army.

The Royal Court Theatre\u0027s artistic director has curated eight filmed monologues for a BBC Four series to mark 100 years of suffrage as a collaboration between the theatre and the broadcaster.  But Featherstone, former artistic director of the National Theatre of Scotland, was as surprised as anybody when the BBC agreed to the suggestive title Snatches, which can be used as a derogatory slang term for a vagina.  She told the Radio Times magazine: \"It\u0027s reclaiming the word, isn\u0027t it?  \"It was my first idea, and I thought, \u0027There\u0027s no way they\u0027re going to let it happen,\u0027 but they (BBC Four) were rather amused by it.  \"And in terms of what we\u0027re doing with the monologues, it fits very well. Our monologues are literally snatches of women\u0027s lives, but a lot of those stories are about people and issues that aren\u0027t really known, so we\u0027re reclaiming the history and we\u0027re reclaiming the word.\"  The series, which will air this summer as part of the broadcaster\u0027s Hear Her season, marks the centenary of women being able to vote in the UK.  The eight short dramas are directed by Vanessa Caswill and Rachna Suri, and have been penned by some of Britain\u0027s most celebrated female writers, including Abi Morgan and Tanika Gupta.  The stars involved include the likes of Atonement actress Romola Garai, Downton Abbey star Siobhan Finneran and Three Girls actress Liv Hill.  Featherstone said that each writer was able to make their own decisions as to what their stories, which will air in 15 minute-long episodes, would be about.  One of the monologues will be based on rape within marriage, while another - starring Garai and penned by Morgan - is about an actress\u0027s experience meeting a producer.  Featherstone said that working on the series has been a bit of a wake-up call in terms of gender equality.  She said: \"I\u0027m an incredibly optimistic person, but I think the shock, for all of us who worked on Snatches, is that things maybe haven\u0027t changed as much for women as we thought they had.  \"We think that everything has changed - and lots of change has happened - but we still have a gender pay gap, we still don\u0027t have equality, because equality, for some, feels threatening.  \"Snatches shows how things can shift. We just have to make sure they don\u0027t shift backwards.\"  Snatches: Moments From Women\u0027s Lives begins on Monday June 18 on BBC Four."},{"url":null,"title":"It   s barking    internet celebrity dog earns boy   500 a month","story":"              An entrepreneurial teenage boy is cashing in on his adorable dog which has amassed thousands of followers on Instagram and poses for popular brands.

The poll was carried out by YouGov for Diabetes UK, who want more people to talk about the illness.  The survey, which interviewed 2,072 people across the UK and 174 in Scotland, found 30% of Scots said they would seek online advice forst over talking to a GP.  Less than a quarter (23%) said they would feel comfortable speaking to an employer about health concerns.  Diabetes UK said there is no such thing as a silly question with diabetes and health and encouraged people to engage with healthcare professionals.  Angela Mitchell, national director of Diabetes Scotland, said: \"Talking about diabetes can be hard.  \"But for someone living with the condition, or caring for someone who does, it can mean getting the right treatment, ensuring your rights are protected at work, or making sure your child gets the best care at school.

Remain-supporting Phillip Lee quit as justice minister, saying \"if Brexit is worth doing, then it is certainly worth doing well\" and it is \"irresponsible to proceed as we are\".  He said his main objection to Government policy was over the \"wish to limit Parliament\u0027s role in contributing to the final outcome\" - the so-called meaningful vote amendment.  His shock departure came as David Davis warned potential Tory rebels that they cannot undo the EU referendum, ahead of a tricky 48 hours in which the Government will try to get its Brexit programme back on track.  The Brexit Secretary spoke after some Conservatives signalled that they would support an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal Bill) tabled late on Monday by former attorney general Dominic Grieve giving more power to MPs.  The Commons begins two days of debate and votes on the Bill on Tuesday and Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment calls for a binding motion to be passed by the Commons, setting out how to proceed in the event of a \"no deal\" Brexit.  But Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"A meaningful vote is not the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum.  \"We will put in front of Parliament the decision for them to vote ... after that there will be a process of primary legislation to put the actual details of it in Parliament, so Parliament will actually decide on the application of the detail.\"  Asked what would happen if they voted against the deal, he said: \"If they throw it out, well, they throw it out. We will have to go away, think about it and come back and make a statement, which is what I am saying to the House this afternoon.\"  The Prime Minister appeared to have defused a potentially explosive row over the EU customs union on Monday night as Tory pro-Europe rebels Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan and Brexiteers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Sir Bill Cash came together to table a separate compromise amendment backing \"a customs arrangement\" with the EU.  Government sources signalled to the Press Association that ministers were set to back the move. However, the compromise is only likely to delay a full-blown showdown on the customs union until trade legislation returns to the Commons in July.  Mrs May set the tone for a tense two days as she warned Tory Remainers that if they defied her and backed Lords amendments to the landmark Brexit legislation it would weaken Britain\u0027s hand at the negotiating table.  Addressing a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee on Monday, ahead of the key votes, she said: \"I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible.  \"But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.\"  However, Devon Tory Sarah Wollaston signalled on Tuesday morning that she would back Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment.  Dismissing the Government\u0027s compromise, she tweeted: \"Merely issuing a statement in response would make it a meaningless final vote.  \"Grieve\u0027s amendment puts that right and in a way Govt could and should accept it.\"  She said unless there was a \"meaningful vote\" Parliament would be left with \"the grim choice between a poor deal and exit with no deal at all\".  It would also give hard Brexiteers the chance to \"scupper a good deal\", she claimed.  Sir Oliver defended his compromise agreement, saying it was \"sensible\" in delaying a vote on the customs plan until details were more settled.  Asked on Today if the amendment \"just kicked the can down the road\", he replied: \"That is a very sensible thing to do.  \"If you are engaged in trying to sort something which is complicated out, it makes sense to do it when you know what the thing that you are debating looks like.\"  Meanwhile, Ireland\u0027s premier raised the possibility of delaying Brexit to allow more time to negotiate the UK\u0027s exit deal.  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said extending the March 29 2019 departure date was one of a number of \"different scenarios\" that could be pursued if a withdrawal agreement fails to materialise in the coming months."},{"url":null,"title":"Sir Angus Grossart gives   1m to the revamp of the Burrell Collection","story":"              THE Scottish banker Sir Angus Grossart has given \u0026pound1m to the restoration of one of the nation\u0027s leading museums.

Thus far, more than 125 companies, trusts and foundations, and individuals have pledged financial support to the \u0026pound66m project.

It features five scenes, and measures more than three by four metres when open and over two metres tall, it is made up of five pop-up scenes painted by Byrne: a Highland landscape, a croft, a poppy-strewn war memorial and a Native American tipi.  Made of cardboard, the set was cheap to make and could be transported on the top of a van and quickly set up in village halls as it toured around Scotland.  The actors would turn the page during the play to reveal the next scene: now curators at the V\u0026ampA will turn the pages regularly when it is on show in Dundee.  Byrne said: \"I am thrilled to see it again.  \"It\u0027s wonderful - I thought it was lost forever.\"  Philip Long, Director of V\u0026ampA Dundee, said: \"John Byrne\u0026rsquos striking pop-up book is a fantastic example of imaginative design.  \"Not only was it made to be portable on the long trips between towns and villages across the Highland and Islands, it also added to the magic of the play.  \"It is painted like a children\u0026rsquos book, which deliberately creates quite a juxtaposition with the hard-hitting subject matter of the play.  \"Due to its sheer size there have been limited opportunities for the public to see this stage set after the original 1970s tour of the play, so we are delighted that people will be able to enjoy it when they visit V\u0026ampA Dundee.\"  Dr John Scally, national librarian and chief executive of the National Library of Scotland, said: \"It will be difficult to let this important part of our collection go after years of careful restoration.  \"But that is the whole point of preservation \u0026ndash to enable future generations to enjoy items of great national and cultural significance.  \"We can\u0026rsquot think of a more fitting place for the stage-set to be on display than V\u0026ampA Dundee.\"  7:84 took the play to village halls across the Highlands and Islands.

The adjusted figure for 2016, which takes account of Scotland\u0027s participation in EU emissions trading and is used for reporting against targets, showed a drop of 45.2% from the 1990 baseline, but a 2.5% increase from 2015.

Ministers announced last month that they intend to set a further target to reduce emissions by 90% by 2050.  The decrease in emissions\u0026nbsphas been largely attributed to\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspclosure in 2016 of the Longannet Power Station in Fife.

Bosses at LINK insisted they were doing \u0026ldquoeverything they possibly can to keep automated teller machines (ATMs) open in the communities where they are most needed.  But they admitted efforts to protect cash machines in remote areas would only be in place for four years and some could still close within that time.  LINK, the UK\u0026rsquos main cash machine network, is cutting the fee paid to operators from 25p to 20p per withdrawal over four years, but previously unveiled proposals to protect ATMs one kilometre or more from the next free machine.  It has led to worries that more than half of Scotland\u0027s 5,300 free-to-use ATMS could disappear.  However chairman Sir Mark Boleat admitted these measures would only plug the gap for the next few years, with \u0026ldquobigger issues looming if the number of people using ATMs continues to plummet.  He also appeared to predict widespread closures in cities, adding: \u0026ldquoThere are some city centres with 50 pay-to-use ATMs. We don\u0026rsquot think the public will be disadvantaged if that number falls to 40, or even to 30 or to 20.  Sir Mark said cash use had fallen by 30 per cent in the last 10 years, and was projected to drop by another 40 per cent in the coming decade.  And he insisted \u0026ldquofalling demand meant even protected ATMs could close in the next four years, despite a freeze on the fee paid to operators and additional financial incentives for machines in vulnerable areas.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf transactions fall by 40 per cent in the next 10 years, 30 or 40 per cent, there are bigger issues and we need to address those. Our own data shows consistently this year transactions have fallen by five per cent below last year.  In evidence to Holyrood\u0026rsquos economy committee, LINK estimated that up to 11 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos cash machines may close as a result of the changes to operator fees. But some estimates have put the figure as high as 18 per cent.  Under questioning from MSPs, Sir Mark was unable to provide any breakdown of the impact on Scotland.  But he said 221 ATMs would be protected from fee changes north of the Border.  It came as Professor Russel Griggs, chairman of the new South of Scotland Economic Partnership, told the committee there is no evidence bank branch closures have a long-term effect on communities.  RBS is currently pushing forward with plans to shut at least 52 branches across the country, with a further 10 under review.  Professor Griggs said work he had carried out suggested that while there was initially a \u0026ldquoheavy impact, communities moved on and found other ways of doing things.  He said: \"So I think it probably has a short-term effect but the evidence that I saw as I went around and visited probably 20 or 30 places across the whole of the UK looking at this, is that it settles down again and people go back to doing what they used to do but just in a different way and it\u0027s interesting they don\u0027t tend to move banks.\"  He said that during recent consultation meetings held with hundreds of people across the south of Scotland in connection with the new economic partnership, bank branch closures had been raised only once.  Thomas Docherty, public affairs manager for consumer organisation Which?, said there was a need for more robust evidence on the long-term effects of closures.  He said: \"There hasn\u0027t been a proper study done by anybody of what those longer-term impacts would be on the rate of closures.  \"By the end of this year in Scotland more than 250 branches will have closed in the last four years.  \"I think when you start to get that scale of closures somebody should be stepping up and carrying out that proper investigation.  \"The people who are most likely of course to be affected are older customers and customers who are more vulnerable.  \"Yes, online banking is growing but only 56 per cent of customers, according to UK Finance, currently use online banking, so what is happening to the other 44 per cent \u0026ndash how are their needs being serviced?\""}]
