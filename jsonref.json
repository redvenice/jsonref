[{"url":null,"title":"National Enquirer says leaker Jeff Bezos texts known mistress","story":"The Enquirer published a story last month that included lurid texts between Bezos and former TV anchor Sanchez. Bezos claimed on Thursday that AMI later threatened to expose his revealing photos if he didn\u0027t have his private investigators back off.The Amazon boss has been investigating how the tabloid obtained his private exchanges with his mistress.Bezos, who is also owner of The Washington Post, detailed his interactions with AMI, in an extraordinary blog post Thursday on Medium.com. The billionaire did not say the tabloid was seeking money - instead, he said, the Enquirer wanted him to make a public statement that the tabloid\u0027s coverage was not politically motivated. AMI\u0027s attorney defended  the tabloid\u0027s practice on Sunday, saying it was a \u0027negotiation\u0027. Abramowitz also refuted allegations the story was politically motivated because of Pecker\u0027s close friendship with President Trump, who has repeatedly railed against Bezos.  \u0027It absolutely is not extortion and not blackmail,\u0027 Abramowitz said. \u0027Bezos didn\u0027t want another story written about him or those pictures published, AMI did not want to have the libel against them that this was inspired by the White House, inspired by Saudi Arabia or inspired by The Washington Post. \u0027It had nothing to do with it. It was a usual story that National Enquirer gets from reliable sources.\u0027          Bezos claimed on Thursday that AMI later threatened to expose his revealing photos if he didn\u0027t have his private investigators back off. The Amazon boss has been investigating how the tabloid obtained his private exchanges with his mistress          Elkan Abramowitz  refused to answer when asked if the leaker was Lauren Sanchez\u0027s brother Michael. Lauren is pictured above at Santa Monica AirportWhen asked if it was a \u0027take down\u0027 to please Trump, Abramowitz replied: \u0027Any investigator knew it was not the White House.\u0027 Bezos\u0027 accusations from earlier in the week added another twist to the high-profile clash between the world\u0027s richest man and the leader of America\u0027s best-known tabloid. Bezos\u0027 investigators have suggested the Enquirer\u0027s coverage of his affair - which included the release of risque texts - was driven by dirty politics. \u0027Of course I don\u0027t want personal photos published, but I also won\u0027t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption,\u0027 Bezos wrote of AMI, in explaining his decision to go public. \u0027I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\u0027 AMI has admitted in the past that it engaged in what\u0027s known as \u0027catch-and-kill\u0027 practices to help Trump become president. Trump has been highly critical of Bezos and the Post\u0027s coverage of the White House. The Bezos affair became public when the Enquirer published a January 9 story about his relationship with Sanchez, a former TV anchor who is also married. Bezos then hired a team of private investigators to find out how the tabloid got the texts and photos the two exchanged.Several days ago, someone at AMI told Bezos\u0027 team that the company\u0027s CEO David Pecker was \u0027apoplectic\u0027 about the investigation, Bezos said. AMI later approached Bezos\u0027 representatives with an offer.  American Media has defended their dealings with billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in a statement, saying the company \u0027acted lawfully\u0027 (AMI owner David Pecker on left, Chief Content Creator Dylan Howard on right)          The National Enquirer\u0027s cover story on Bezos\u0027 orce and relationship with Sanchez \u0027They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn\u0027t stop our investigation,\u0027 Bezos wrote.Bezos wrote that this week, the tabloid\u0027s editor, Dylan Howard, emailed an attorney for Bezos\u0027 longtime security consultant to describe photos the Enquirer \u0027obtained during our newsgathering.\u0027 The photos include a \u0027below the belt selfie\u0027 of Bezos, photos of him in tight boxer-briefs and wearing only a towel, and several revealing photos of Sanchez, according to the emails Bezos released.According to the emails, an attorney for AMI offered a formal deal Wednesday: The tabloid wouldn\u0027t post the photos if Bezos and his investigators would release a public statement \u0027affirming that they have no knowledge or basis\u0027 to suggest the Enquirer\u0027s coverage was \u0027politically motivated or influenced by political forces.\u0027Bezos said he decided to publish the emails sent to his team \u0027rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail,\u0027 despite the \u0027personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.\u0027In its initial story, the Enquirer said reporters followed Bezos and Sanchez \u0027across five states and 40,000 miles\u0027 and \u0027tailed them in private jets, swanky limos, helicopter rides, romantic hikes, five-star hotel hideaways, intimate dinner dates and \u0027quality time\u0027 in hidden love nests.\u0027It reported that Bezos sent \u0027sleazy text messages and gushing love notes\u0027 to Sanchez, months before Bezos announced he was splitting up with his wife, MacKenzie."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/11/22/0646D725000007D0-6693267-image-a-43_1549924256345.jpg","title":"Leadsom ratchets pressure PM ditch HS2","story":"    Andrea Leadsom has ratcheted up pressure on the Prime Minister to ditch HS2, expressing fears that the business case for the rail link ‘may no longer exist’.Mrs Leadsom said she had been contacted by several constituents who were ‘incredulous’ at the statement, as well as Sir Terry’s ‘refusal to reject’ the assertion by the committee’s chairman Lord Hollick that billions more will have to be spent on HS2 for it to deliver the benefits promised.Mrs Leadsom is said to be part of mounting opposition in government against HS2, alongside Theresa May’s effective deputy David Lidington and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss. A Dispatches investigation aired by Channel 4 last night claimed ministers are so alarmed by HS2’s price that they are ‘increasingly minded to kill off the scheme’.The report claimed ministers fear HS2 will cost up to £6billion a year over the next decade – equivalent to Network Rail’s annual budget to maintain and upgrade Britain’s entire rail infrastructure.It also suggested officials believe HS2 easily exceed its current £59billion budget.Mrs Leadsom’s letter raised Mr Thurston’s admission that HS2 may run slower and less frequent trains in order to save costs and stick to its £56billion budget. Last month it emerged that officials have considered plans to lower train speeds of up to 225mph by around 30mph and reduce the number of trains per hour in both directions from 18 to 14.Mrs Leadsom said her constituents had warned that if the speed of the HS2 line was reduced to 186mph – in line with the top speed for Eurostar – this would shave just 15 minutes from the current journey time between London and Birmingham on the West Coast Main Line.HS2 had promised to cut the time taken for this journey by about half an hour, from one hour 21 minutes to 49 minutes.    A Dispatches investigation aired by Channel 4 last night claimed ministers are so alarmed by HS2’s price that they are ‘increasingly minded to kill off the scheme’. Pictured an artist impression of a HS2 trainMrs Leadsom wrote: ‘You will appreciate why my constituents – who are directly affected by the construction and operation of HS2 but will see no benefit – are increasingly concerned that the business case is being undermined from all angles, and the basis for which Parliament gave its support to the project may no longer exist.’ Although the first leg of HS2 from London to Birmingham has been approved by Parliament, the next stage to link it to the North has yet to be put to a vote.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling recently claimed that stopping HS2 at Birmingham would be a ‘betrayal’ of the Midlands and the North.Liz Truss raised speculation over the future of HS2 last month after declaring that the Government must be prepared to ‘junk white elephant projects’. But yesterday the Prime Minister’s spokesman dismissed claims that HS2 could be scrapped or scaled back, and said the organisation was working to control costs.Rachael Maskell, Labour’s rail spokesman, said the Department for Transport needs to ‘get a grip on HS2’s costs urgently’ and set out a detailed plan for the costs for MPs to review.A spokesman for the troubled rail project said: ‘HS2 continues to work to the scope and budget requirements that have been set out by government.’j.salmon@dailymail.co.uk "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/12/02/0CA0BBC8000005DC-6693605-The_Archers_soap_opera_set_in_the_fictional_village_of_Ambridge_-a-1_1549937161568.jpg","title":"Desert Island Discs named best radio time","story":"    Desert Island Discs, which has been enchanting listeners since 1942, has been named the greatest UK radio programme ever.

She is ultra cautious, is well aware that the world has their eyes on her and that is just how she likes it. \u0027This is not a spontaneous or intellectually creative woman but a consummate performer and strategist.\u0027There is a strong right slant and her letters have often been retraced.

It was too dangerous after my heart attacks’          Mr Markle says he only asked for help to move house and that any ‘modest’ financial gifts from Meghan were ‘greatly appreciated’          Her father says: ‘I didn’t stop answering my phone. I was in hospital with a heart attack! Meg and Harry knew what was going on’          Mr Markle comments: ‘I have no idea what this means. This is pure Harry. Americans don’t use the “rabbit hole” expression’          Meghan complains Thomas sided with her half-sister Samantha in criticising her, but he insists: ‘I never wanted Meg to suffer.’Trussell also highlighted the embellishments in Meghan\u0027s handwriting, including the strokes that sweep across the tops of words. She said: \u0027They look like little protective umbrellas, giving further credence to her deep feelings on the matter. \u0027They also reveal her vulnerability - the chink in her armour. Surely this is enough proof how much Meghan cares? It must be exhausting for her!\u0027In the letter Meghan admonishes her father, in anguished tones, for siding with her half-sister Samantha – who has attacked her in the press – while she ‘silently suffered at the hand of her vicious lies’.She goes on to complain that Mr Markle has made no attempt to contact her – and chastises him for falsely telling journalists he is the one who has been shunned – a criticism her father vehemently refutes.She also accuses her father of snubbing her and Prince Harry’s offers to help when he pulled out of attending their wedding following two heart attacks and accuses him of being ungrateful for money she has given him.The former award-winning Hollywood lighting director, who now lives in Mexico, said that he never intended to make the handwritten missive public ‘out of respect for Meghan’ – but says he has been forced to do so now because its contents have been falsely portrayed.Contrary to claims made by the Duchess’s friends, he said the letter made no attempt to heal their bitter rift. ‘I thought it would be an olive branch. Instead, it was a dagger to the heart,’ Mr Markle, 74, said last night.He dismissed suggestions he has made no attempt to patch things up since her wedding. He showed this newspaper texts which he says prove he reached out multiple times to his daughter and the son-in-law he has never met.The US magazine People claimed to ‘put the record straight’ over the Duchess’s relationship with her father and criticism of her style as a Royal.It was based on interviews with five friends – at least one of whom is thought to be one of the Duchess’s co-stars in Suits, the legal drama in which she starred for six years.The Duchess came under fire over her apparent decision to allow her confidantes to defend her in the extraordinary interview, without, it is understood, involving Kensington Palace.The palace has refused to comment on whether the magazine’s anonymous sources had co-operated at the direct request of the Duchess or with her tacit approval.          Thomas Markle says: ‘I’ve never attacked Harry. I asked him to man up’          He insists the Duchess is mistaken: ‘I have only ever spoken out in response to fake narratives and lies’          The Duchess refers to the MoS paparazzi photos story, right, but he insists he continued to reach out          In her letter to her father, the Duchess begged him to stop attacker \u0027patient, kind and understanding\u0027 Prince HarryFormer Buckingham Palace press secretary Dickie Arbiter, who worked for both Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, feared the decision would only exacerbate issues.He said: ‘Assuming – and as these sources are anonymous we don’t know for sure – that this was done with her agreement, it has opened a Pandora’s box. The issue with her father is an open wound and I’m not entirely sure it is the best idea to aggravate that.’Last night, Mr Markle said it was unfair for his daughter’s friends to use the media to ‘spin a line’ while he was being criticised for ‘giving a handful’ of interviews to the press. In the article last Wednesday, the Duchess’s friends said that she was devastated by his response to the letter, in which he suggested father and daughter pose for press pictures.One friend said: ‘She feels like “that’s the opposite of what I’m saying. I’m telling you that I don’t want to communicate through the media, and you’re asking me to… Did you hear anything I said?” ’Mr Markle said he had suggested the photo op as a way of showing the world they could be friends again, describing the Duchess’s reading of it as ‘tragic misunderstanding’ he wishes he could put straight. The rift between the Duchess and her father began after The Mail on Sunday revealed, just days before her wedding in May last year, that he had colluded with the paparazzi to stage a series of lucrative photo opportunities.Such was his humiliation that he offered to pull out of attending the Royal Wedding and was later prevented from going after suffering two heart attacks.Since then, he has given a series of damaging interviews in which he has spoken of his dismay at being cast adrift by his daughter and the Royal Family.Emma Bache\u0027s first book, Reading Between The Lines, is published by Quercus on the 30th of August 2018.             Thomas\u0027s Anguished Reply           The Duchess insisted she phoned him, but he had no missed calls          Mr Markle says he never attacked Harry, but feels he should have met him before the wedding          Mr Markle insists his bid to reduce press intrusion was ‘completely misinterpreted’      "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry seen time Meghans devastating letters","story":"    The Duke of Sussex alongside French Rugby Federation president Bernard Laporte in the Twickenham stands before England\u0027s Six Nations clash against France today             The royal was stood next to Rugby Football Union president Chris Kelly (left) as he sang the National Anthem  with the home crowd   Make like Meghan in a monochrome dress by GivenchyShop the brandThere is no doubt  the Duchess of Sussex has built an impressive fashion portfolio since joining the Royal Family.

He also took aim at her stepfather Danny Peat (right at the inquest today)  Kelly Peat  had put her daughter Amber\u0027s disappearance down to \u0027attention-seeking\u0027 and had believed she would come back, an inquest has heardHe then asked him: \u0027Making Amber wash the dishes all the time, did you ever consider her emotional well-being?\u0027Danny replied: \u0027I saw her as my daughter, but obviously kids do have to have some sort of discipline in place. I didn\u0027t think washing pots was a massive thing.\u0027Adrian then asked if it was \u0027neglectful\u0027 that they had waited so long to report Amber missing.          Kelly Peat was pictured at her daughter\u0027s inquest in Nottingham todayDanny replied: \u0027I wasn\u0027t worried. I just assumed she would walk through the door. That she had had a strop and walked out and would be back soon.\u0027  Nottingham Coroner\u0027s Court has heard allegations the 13-year-old was \u0027heavily sanctioned\u0027 for \u0027undesirable behaviour\u0027 – including being told to wash every pot in the kitchen and being woken at 10.30pm and forced to mop the floors. Earlier, Amber Peat\u0027s mother denied her daughter had wanted to kill herself and instead claimed the teenager was taking part in a self-harming \u0027competition\u0027 at school.Kelly Peat said her 13-year-old child\u0027s intention was to \u0027mark herself\u0027 rather than take her own life  when she was found hanged in bushes in Mansfield.She said today: \u0027We thought she was going to come back. I was just giving her time to calm down\u0027. Amber\u0027s mother also told the Nottingham inquest into her death that she had smashed her daughter\u0027s phone with a hammer during one big row.She also admitted they would \u0027butt heads\u0027 over household chores but denied allegations that the 13-year-old was made to get up out of bed at 10.30pm and clean the floors for three hours.Mrs Peat also sobbed as she knocked back allegations made by Amber\u0027s youth worker that she laughed when her daughter gave her a note saying \u0027I just want to be your little girl again\u0027.            Amber was found dead in this hedgerow in Mansfield - but her mother believes she had not meant to hang herselfLast week a police officer claimed that Mrs Peat showed \u0027no emotion\u0027 after the 13-year-old fled and gave \u0027rehearsed\u0027 information to police before putting Amber\u0027s disappearance down to \u0027attention-seeking\u0027. The 37-year-old added she didn\u0027t believe her daughter intending to kill herself – and instead wanted to possibly to \u0027make a mark to show her friends\u0027.Mrs Peat said: \u0027There was a lot of competition at school at that time with self-harming when kids were cutting themselves and harming themselves.\u0027I think she had every intention of coming home.\u0027Ms Bower told Mrs Peat that she\u0027d seen or heard nothing in the evidence about a \u0027self-harming competition\u0027 – and suggested it was \u0027odd\u0027 that Amber would have it on her mind when she was angry after the cool box row.            Daniel Peat said to police that Amber\u0027s her \u0027only hobby was reading and she had no real friends\u0027But Mrs Peat replied: \u0027I am just saying what I was aware of at that time.\u0027She went on to deny claims Amber had been harshly punished at home for bad behaviour – and said it was her OWN choice to wear baggy jogging bottoms to school, an incident the inquest has previously heard made her the subject of ridicule from other children.Mrs Peat added the incident came about when she told Amber to pick something to go to school in after realising she had no clean school trousers.She said: \u0027They didn\u0027t look like uniform but she would not take them off. She could be very headstrong when she wanted to be.\u0027The mother told the hearing that other incidents that had been mentioned in evidence were untrue. She said Amber had never shown her a letter that she claimed to have written with a school support worker that read \u0027I just want to be your little girl again\u0027.And she denied Amber had been forced to mop the floors at night, or clean every pot in her kitchen, by Mr Peat – saying she had \u0027no idea\u0027 why the youngster would make up the \u0027stories\u0027.However, Mrs Peat DID admit smashing up Amber\u0027s phone with a hammer in January 2015, four months before her death – but said it was because she and a sibling had refused to confess to \u0027stealing and lying\u0027.She also refuted allegations that Amber had been told \u0027what goes on in this house stays in this house\u0027, adding: \u0027The only time I asked her not to say anything to her friends was when Danny was going to prison (for tax fraud in 2014) and I did not want her to get bullied at school.\u0027Mrs Peat said she had known her husband since the age of 12, and claimed the couple had first dated in 2009 before beginning a serious relationship in early 2013 after she and Amber\u0027s natural dad split up a month earlier.Within a few weeks they had moved in together and become engaged. Ms Bower asked Mrs Peat: \u0027In the space of a few weeks Amber had seen her dad leave home, a new man move in, you lived together as a family and become engaged. With the benefit of hindsight, was that a lot for a 10-year-old to take on board in a short space of time?\u0027Mrs Peat replied: \u0027Yes, but they already knew Danny and I thought it was time for a fresh start.\u0027She said her daughter and husband \u0027butted heads\u0027 at times, and it would often \u0027come to a point where Danny would say \u0027you talk to her, she is not listening to me\u0027.\u0027Alarm bells\u0027 were ringing at school over \u0027Cinderella\u0027 girl,...\u0027Cinderella\u0027 schoolgirl Amber Peat, 13, who ran away from...Tragic schoolgirl, 13, found hanged in a bush was LAUGHED at...Social worker says she felt there was \u0027no immediate risk\u0027 to...\u0027I haven\u0027t got anything happy to write about\u0027: What...Girl, 13, made \u0027running away list\u0027 before she fled her home...Share this articleIt is believed she was already dead by the time they called in the police. The last man to see her alive told detectives turned up at his door two days after he reported it to them.Adam Lamb said the police asked if they could walk to where he last spotted Amber at 5.20pm on May 30 2015 and she was found hanging in the hedgerow nearby.The coroner has been told the vulnerable teenager was being \u0027emotionally abused\u0027 at home and subjected to a series of draconian punishments for \u0027undesirable behaviour\u0027.On one occasion, she claimed she had been been awoken by her stepfather at 1.30am and told to mop floors as a punishment for failing to fulfil domestic chores. Amber vanished at around 5.10pm – but wasn\u0027t reported missing until 12.56am the following day, after her parents had their dinner and went shopping.Tragically  she was already dead by that point.PC Nicola Roe was one of the first officers to respond to the missing persons call from Kelly Peat.She went to the family home with a colleague and was told by the 37-year-old that Amber had stormed out of the house after being asked to clean out a cool box.           Kelly Peat, and step father Danny Peat appeal for missing Amber to come home - but by that time she was already dead          The family did not report Amber missing until they had \u0027been to Tesco and had their tea\u0027. Pictured above the missing poster which was put up once it had been reported that Amber was missing Asked by coroner Laurinda Bower for her observations about Kelly, PC Roe replied: \u0027She was quite matter-of-fact about how she was describing the situation.\u0027  Amber Peat wrote to her mother Kelly  telling her: \u0027I just wanted to be you little girl again\u0027 - but she laughed at it, the inquest heard previouslyThe officer said she \u0027wasn\u0027t really surprised\u0027 because \u0027people present differently\u0027, adding: \u0027She seemed tired but not particularly emotional. Not upset, maybe frustrated.\u0027She explained the background that she had gone missing previously in similar circumstances, and referred to her throwing temper tantrums and attention-seeking behaviour.\u0027PC Roe said the family \u0027seemed quite well rehearsed in giving information to the police\u0027, and \u0027the general consensus was they expected her back the next morning\u0027.She added: \u0027They said she normally came back at night and that is why they left it quite late to report it.\u0027In extraordinary scenes last week Amber\u0027s biological father was described as \u0027nothing but a sperm donor\u0027 and subjected to \u0027vile abuse by her stepdad\u0027, he told the inquest into his daughter\u0027s death. Adrian Cook found out about the 13-year-old\u0027s disappearance on Facebook and tried to contact her mother, Kelly Peat, for information, but was bombarded with angry insults from Danny Peat.Danny Peat told Amber\u0027s estranged father: \u0027She is not your f****** daughter. She wants nothing to do with you. You are nothing but a sperm donor\u0027, the inquest heard.Peat, who ran away from home and was found dead in hedgerow three days later felt she was being \u0027humiliated\u0027 by her stepfather and cruelly forced to do household chores. "},{"url":null,"title":"Coleen Rooney forgives Wayne cosying barmaid ten hour bender","story":"    Coleen Rooney was seen wearing her wedding ring todayColeen Rooney has forgiven husband Wayne after carpeting him over his ten-hour drink binge and cosy chat with a barmaid. The ex-England skipper convinced Coleen he\u0027s \u0027done nothing wrong\u0027 after downing shots with bar girl Vickie Rosiek until 2.30am on a recent night out in Florida.Today, Coleen was seen out in Washington with her wedding ring on. Coleen\u0027s trust in the 33-year-old ace is so strong she is taking their four boys on holiday, leaving her husband home alone to train with DC United for the new season.Rather than rushing to be by his side Coleen will put even more miles between them over the school break. \u0027He\u0027s not in any trouble with Coleen.

When it first took to the skies it transformed the world of  aviationA few seconds later, hurtling at just over 150 mph, the first jumbo jet took to the skies. From that moment on, the world of aviation would never be the same again.Since the first flight of the Boeing 747 half a century ago, the jumbo has transported 3.5 billion passengers as well as billions of tons of cargo all around the planet — including another aviation icon, the Space Shuttle, which was ferried around America on the back of a jumbo.More than any other aircraft, the jumbo jet, with its ability to transport around 600 passengers over 8,000 miles at just under the speed of sound, has shrunk the world.It also ushered in an age of luxury in the skies: glamorous air stewardesses who offered a smile as they marshalled food trolleys up the aisle serving filet mignon from an a la carte menu cocktails served to sharply dressed businessmen wreathed in cigar smoke.This was a time when commercial flights were a holiday in themselves. But now, 50 years later, the jumbo is slowly disappearing from our skies.Although nearly 1,600 have been built since 1969, there are only around 500 still flying.British Airways, Boeing\u0027s biggest jumbo customer, has only 34 in the air, with a further 36 in storage. By 2024, the airline will have stopped flying them altogether.Dutch airline KLM is also phasing them out, while Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines are now only using 747s — which weigh 435 tons at full-capacity — as cargo planes.You do not need to be an aeroplane anorak to find this a little sad. Many of us have an enormous affection for the jumbo, and no matter how many times you fly on one, you still can\u0027t help but be impressed by its size.The jumbo\u0027s demise is no fault of its age. Boeing is still producing planes even today, with some 24 orders for the latest cargo version — the 747-8F — on its books. Its problem lies in its cost.On a practical level, it is now possible to fly around 400 passengers across the Atlantic on two engines, and it makes little financial sense to fly 600 people the same distance on the jumbo\u0027s four.Environmental tariffs and landing fees levied by airports have also dramatically increased.Landing a jumbo at full capacity at Heathrow costs around £12,500. Of that, nearly £4,000 is in environmental tariffs, whereas for a Boeing 787, which can take around 330 passengers, that tariff is around £1,000.With airlines operating at such tight margins, it is far more economical to fly two 787s from, say, New York to London, than one jumbo jet.But while the jumbo\u0027s days might be numbered, it certainly had an extraordinarily good run.After all, its creators thought all long-haul aircraft would be supersonic by the Seventies, and planned to phase it out after a decade. Many at Boeing didn\u0027t even think the jumbo would last that long, given its birth was beset by myriad problems. The eventual choice of engine, made by Pratt \u0026amp Whitney and known as the JT9D, was a particular cause for concern.It suffered from power surges and had a tendency to stall — hardly ideal characteristics for any plane, let alone one as large as the 747.The JT9D\u0027s blades also rubbed against the bottom of the engine casing, which not only made it underperform, but was also potentially lethal if it destroyed the engine.          The Space Shuttle Orbiter is mounted on top of a Boeing 747 carrier aircraft and flown. The first landing test took place on 12th August 1977          The Space Shuttle Endeavour lifts off just just after sunrise on the first leg of its journey back to the Kennedy Space Center atop a Boeing 747 carrier aircraft          The Space Shuttle Discovery sits on top of  NASA\u0027s modified Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft as the aircraft takes flight from with Edwards Air Force Base in CaliforniaAnother large problem was the basic design of the plane, which was intended to have two decks.But during testing, they found it impossible to evacuate the plane within the required 90 seconds, and, worse still, people actually broke bones at they slid down escape chutes a few storeys high.As a result, the size of the top deck was reduced. But despite such problems, on September 30, 1968, the first 747 was rolled out to meet the press and public.To the tune of Elgar\u0027s Pomp and Circumstance, it emerged from its hangar, its red and white livery gleaming in the sun.Despite the fact that the 747 had never flown, the plane boasted the insignia of the 26 airlines that had already placed orders. Accompanying the plane — which would be called City of Everett — were female cabin crew from each of the airlines, who somewhat haphazardly smashed bottles of champagne against the fuselage.When the test flight took place just over four months later, the plane was treated somewhat better. Pilot Jack Waddell only tried the most gentle manoeuvres, and was delighted to find the 747 handled well.But, looking at the temperature gauge in the cockpit, he noticed that — for some unknown reason — one of the Pratt \u0026amp Whitney engines was running some 30 degrees hotter than the others. Rather than panic, Waddell coolly decided to continue to climb, and the engines suffered no further issues.But, several minutes later, Waddell lowered the wings\u0027 flaps and the three-strong crew heard a strange thud.Something was emphatically not right and, after a quick investigation by chief engineer Jess Wallick, it emerged that part of the flaps on the starboard wing had worked loose. This was a reason for ending the flight and, after one hour and 16 minutes, Waddell made the jumbo\u0027s first ever landing.Despite the glitches, the test flight was judged a success, and just under a year later — on January 21, 1970 — 336 passengers sat in Pan Am\u0027s Clipper of America to take the first commercial jumbo flight, from New York to London.Its lift-off was somewhat stunted, however. As the plane taxied down the runway, the pilot noted the exhaust temperature from one engine was too high. Deciding that safety was more important than public relations, he returned to the terminal.Unsurprisingly, the passengers, all of whom had paid $375 for their tickets — about $5,000 today — were thoroughly annoyed.Luckily, there was a spare 747, the Clipper Victor, which Pan Am had received only the day before. The passengers switched planes and touched down at London Heathrow just six hours and 16 minutes later.Since 1970, the 747 has had, well, many ups and downs. The plane has been involved in nearly 150 accidents and incidents, most of which have been caused by human error, or terrorism.In total, 3,746 people have died in jumbo jets. That may sound high, but it represents just 0.0001 per cent of all those who have flown on the 747.Tragic though those deaths undoubtedly are, there is much we should celebrate about the jumbo.It has carried everything from American presidents to pregnant livestock, and even though we will see less of her, she will continue to fly for many years to come.She is unlikely to survive another 50 years, but when she does land for the final time, she will never be forgotten.Boeing 747 — A History: Delivering The Dream by Martin Bowman is published by Pen \u0026amp Sword.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Welsh star Aaron Ramsey agrees 400 000 WEEK deal Britains highest paid footballer","story":"    Childhood sweethearts: Aaron Ramsey and wife Colleen at the \u0027Don\u0027t Take Me Home\u0027 film premiere, London, 2017Oscars 2019: Lady Gaga and Amy Adams lead the largest class...EXCLUSIVE: Convicted pedophile who confessed to killing...Share this article    Ramsey and Colleen (pictured) married  in 2014 and had their first child, Sonny, the following year  In October, Colleen, who describes herself as an ‘enthusiastic foodie’ on Instagram, gave birth to twin boysDuring that time he has won the FA Cup three times, twice scoring the winner – against Hull in 2014 and against Chelsea in 2017.His eye-watering pre-contract agreement to join Juventus in the summer is a result of the Turin side not having to pay Arsenal a transfer fee because Ramsey’s contract expires then.Ramsey grew up in the South Wales town of Caerphilly and met wife Colleen Rowlands at Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni, a Welsh-speaking school where he was a champion athlete and obtained ten GCSEs.

Almost 3,000 were lost in the six months to December 2018 – more than half of which had been free to use, according to research by the Which? consumer groupRecent problems involving TSB, Visa and other financial firms left people unable to pay for petrol, groceries or restaurant meals.Some Lloyds customers faced ‘intermittent issues’ yesterday when trying to log on to its online banking system, while last month, hundreds of thousands of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland customers were unable to make payments from their online accounts.The Which? research shows most Britons still use cash and object to the idea of it being phased out.But banks are killing off cash as it is cheaper for them to process electronic payments rather than having to handle, count, transport, and guard notes and coins.Travel organisations such as Transport for London refuse to take cash, making it impossible to buy a ticket with coins or notes.Jenni Allen, of Which? Money, said: ‘The alarming rate of cashpoint and bank closures risks leaving people facing an uphill battle to access the cash they rely on. Cash is also a vital back-up as fallible digital payments grow in popularity. So the Government must appoint a regulator to oversee these changes and ensure no one is excluded.’Mike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘The rapid pace of bank and cashpoint closures is hurting small businesses.          At the same time, banks are closing more branches to cut costs, with more than 3,300 being axed since 2015‘Millions of small firms have customers who want to pay using notes and coins. The majority of shoppers either use cash frequently or want to see access to it maintained. Bank branches and cashpoints create a natural draw for high streets. They give shoppers a reason to visit.‘When bank branches and cashpoints are lost, local growth often takes a hit. It’s time for a regulator to be given responsibility for protecting access to notes and coins.’Natalie Ceeney, chairman of the Access To Cash Review – an independent probe into the future of money – said: ‘For millions of people in the UK, cash is not a choice, it’s a necessity. If we don’t plan for a world of lower cash – if we sleepwalk into a cashless society – millions of people will be left behind.’The ATM network is run by the Link organisation, which has a duty to ensure all communities have access. It said: ‘We agree with Which? – free access to cash is vital for consumers. As payment habits change, the UK needs to work out how to maintain cash access.’The Payments Systems Regulator – an offshoot of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority – has a role in policing electronic payments. A spokesman said: ‘We are holding Link to account for its commitment to preserve the geographic spread of free-to-use ATMs.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/11/22/0646D725000007D0-6693267-image-a-43_1549924256345.jpg","title":"Leadsom ratchets pressure PM ditch HS2","story":"    Andrea Leadsom has ratcheted up pressure on the Prime Minister to ditch HS2, expressing fears that the business case for the rail link ‘may no longer exist’.Mrs Leadsom said she had been contacted by several constituents who were ‘incredulous’ at the statement, as well as Sir Terry’s ‘refusal to reject’ the assertion by the committee’s chairman Lord Hollick that billions more will have to be spent on HS2 for it to deliver the benefits promised.Mrs Leadsom is said to be part of mounting opposition in government against HS2, alongside Theresa May’s effective deputy David Lidington and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss. A Dispatches investigation aired by Channel 4 last night claimed ministers are so alarmed by HS2’s price that they are ‘increasingly minded to kill off the scheme’.The report claimed ministers fear HS2 will cost up to £6billion a year over the next decade – equivalent to Network Rail’s annual budget to maintain and upgrade Britain’s entire rail infrastructure.It also suggested officials believe HS2 easily exceed its current £59billion budget.Mrs Leadsom’s letter raised Mr Thurston’s admission that HS2 may run slower and less frequent trains in order to save costs and stick to its £56billion budget. Last month it emerged that officials have considered plans to lower train speeds of up to 225mph by around 30mph and reduce the number of trains per hour in both directions from 18 to 14.Mrs Leadsom said her constituents had warned that if the speed of the HS2 line was reduced to 186mph – in line with the top speed for Eurostar – this would shave just 15 minutes from the current journey time between London and Birmingham on the West Coast Main Line.HS2 had promised to cut the time taken for this journey by about half an hour, from one hour 21 minutes to 49 minutes.    A Dispatches investigation aired by Channel 4 last night claimed ministers are so alarmed by HS2’s price that they are ‘increasingly minded to kill off the scheme’. Pictured an artist impression of a HS2 trainMrs Leadsom wrote: ‘You will appreciate why my constituents – who are directly affected by the construction and operation of HS2 but will see no benefit – are increasingly concerned that the business case is being undermined from all angles, and the basis for which Parliament gave its support to the project may no longer exist.’ Although the first leg of HS2 from London to Birmingham has been approved by Parliament, the next stage to link it to the North has yet to be put to a vote.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling recently claimed that stopping HS2 at Birmingham would be a ‘betrayal’ of the Midlands and the North.Liz Truss raised speculation over the future of HS2 last month after declaring that the Government must be prepared to ‘junk white elephant projects’. But yesterday the Prime Minister’s spokesman dismissed claims that HS2 could be scrapped or scaled back, and said the organisation was working to control costs.Rachael Maskell, Labour’s rail spokesman, said the Department for Transport needs to ‘get a grip on HS2’s costs urgently’ and set out a detailed plan for the costs for MPs to review.A spokesman for the troubled rail project said: ‘HS2 continues to work to the scope and budget requirements that have been set out by government.’j.salmon@dailymail.co.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"The British cities faster cycle drive","story":"    It\u0027s now faster to cycle than drive in some city centres as Britain’s roads become increasingly gridlocked, a report has found (pictured, M6 Junction 10 at Walsall, West Midlands)It concluded that it has become ‘faster to ride a bike than drive or take the bus’ for millions of motorists in Britain.It found that last year drivers in six UK cities – London, Edinburgh, Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield – crawled along at an average speed of 10mph or less in the last mile of their journey.

This was followed by the A23 in Kennington, south London. Outside the capital, Leeds RoadSaltaire Road in Leeds was the worst for traffic, followed by the A34Stratford Road in Birmingham.A growing population and the boom in online shopping, with a surge in delivery vans on the roads, have been identified as key factors driving record levels of traffic in the UK.          London and Edinburgh are the two most congested cities in the UK, with drivers clocking up average speeds of only 7mph during the final mile of their journeys, the global traffic audit has revealed (pictured, the scene on the M11 near Cambridge)The report also reveals the huge cost of Britain’s gridlock. It said congestion hit the economy by £8billion in a year as drivers wasted time sitting in their cars rather than working or spending money in shops and restaurants. This equates to £1,317 per driver.Inrix said the study could not be compared to those it has carried out in previous years, because the way it calculates congestion has changed. But its transport analyst, Trevor Reed, said: ‘Congestion costs Brits billions of pounds each year.’Chancellor Philip Hammond has identified traffic as one of the factors holding back productivity, with Britons spending too much time travelling and not enough working.Howard Cox, founder of motoring campaign group FairFuelUK, said: ‘It’s crucial that our politicos take the UK’s road economy seriously and endow HS2 levels of cash into our Third World roads infrastructure.’Labour MP Wes Streeting said: ‘This report underlines the importance of building fast and reliable public transport systems across the country, not just in London.’The Department for Transport said: ‘We are investing a record £23billion on our roads to reduce congestion and make journeys better for motorists.‘We are also giving councils record amounts of capital funding – more than £7.1billion up to 2021 – and the £2.5billion Transforming Cities Fund will see innovative public transport schemes developed to further tackle congestion in some of England’s biggest cities.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/11/18/04F9B421000007D0-0-image-m-41_1549908106001.jpg","title":"How Corbyn vowed defeat EU explosive unseen footage Left wing rally","story":"Jeremy Corbyn called for the European Union to be \u0027defeated\u0027 in an explosive rally speech (file photo)Labour expels just 12 people for anti-Semitism after...Boris Johnson says he could vote for Brexit deal if backstop...Share this articleIt comes after previous footage showed Mr Corbyn condemning the EU as a \u0027European empire of the 21st century\u0027 and a \u0027military Frankenstein\u0027.In the new footage unearthed by talkRADIO, he is shown saying: \u0027They, the world\u0027s bankers, International Monetary Fund, European Union, they are utterly united in what they want.\u0027Utterly united in deflation, suppressing the economy, and creating unemployment.

Donald Trump has told Americans his administration had accelerated talks for a political settlement in Afghanistan and would be able to reduce US troops there as negotiations advance to end America’s longest war.No one knows what form a new government may take or how much control the Taliban might have under any deal, but for young people who were babies when the Taliban were driven from power by a US-led campaign in 2001, the prospect of peace with the hardline Islamists brings a daunting mix of hope and fear.For villagers in rural Afghanistan, where traditional ways have always counted for more than central government law, life may not change much. But for the young of Kabul and other cities, there is much to lose, in particular the freedoms restored after the Taliban were ousted – from playing music, to modelling and adopting trendy haircuts – which they’ve grown up with.“The thing I’m most worried about is that if they return, I’ll not be able to continue playing music,” said a 16-year-old pianist who attends music school in Kabul.  “It will be great if the government and the Taliban reach a peace deal. At that time there should be access to music for everyone and women’s rights must be protected.”When the Taliban were last in power, they gained global notoriety for a harsh regime that forced women and girls to stay at home, restricted music and sports and imposed brutal punishment on infractions of a hardline version of Islamic law. More recently, they have adopted a more moderate tone, including pledges on rights for women and girls’ education, appeals for support from foreign aid groups and promises to maintain good international relations.While huge doubts remain, the peace talks have given young people a sense of hope.  “I am optimistic about the Taliban joining the peace process,” said Hussain, 19, who like many young Afghans grew up in neighbouring Iran where millions have taken refuge from war. He now works as a hairdresser in Kabul. “It will be an end to the war and conflicts in our country. I want the Taliban to change their policy and not behave like before.”They have also had to deal with near-daily violence and a broken economy that cannot provide jobs for the 400,000 or so new entrants to the workforce every year. Hundreds of thousands have migrated in the years since 2014, when most foreign forces left. Many have risked dangerous journeys in search of new homes in countries such as Turkey, or in Europe or further afield. For some of those who have remained, there is now hope that peace will bring opportunities.Women’s rights have improved in recent years under the western-backed Afghan government, especially in cities such as the capital Kabul, where many women work outside the home and more than a quarter of the parliament is female.The male generational gap may be explained by younger men seeking rigid gender roles as they struggle to find work and stability in a country ravaged by war and poverty, said gender equality group Promundo. Religious teachings against women’s rights under the Taliban regime had also played a role in hardening views among younger men.Sultan Qasim Sayeedi, an 18-year-old model scours Facebook, YouTube and Instagram to learn about fashion and modelling, and draws inspiration from his favourite models, including Saudi Arabia’s Omar Borkan, and Canadian popstar Justin Bieber. “We’re afraid that if the Taliban come then we will not be able to hold our shows,” he said. Despite that wariness, Sultan says it’s time the fighting ended. “If American troops will go peace will come, we want peace,” he said.Maryam Ghulami, a 20-year-old living in the western province of Herat, says her generation will bring change that her parents never could. She is learning graphic design and computer coding at an online academy and likes to hone her skills with YouTube tutorials. While she believes Afghanistan faces many problems – a slow and unreliable internet connection, for a start – she has faith that her generation can bring change. “The new generation can change Afghanistan with knowledge, with technology,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30208d8509f66775a6e3e8193d9fe2005d0f7c7a/511_826_2018_1210/master/2018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40134ce05289f956c26ca8eafb2a094f","title":"shelf policing how books and cacti make women too spiky for men","story":"‘To create a new relationship,’ a life coach advises single women to empty their boudoir of distractions such as books – particularly if they’re downbeat“How to avoid turning your home into a MANrepeller”, the Daily Mail proclaimed from atop the mountain on Sunday. “Interiors therapist reveals the items that could be making your abode offputting to men.”It could be forgiven for wanting to jump on the Marie Kondo bandwagon, but the twist obviously had to be that the gaze you must please is not your own, but a man’s.Femail’s nominated manrepeller was a journalist named Liz Hoggard, and her salvation came in the form of life coach Suzanne Roynon, whose mission is to “clear your past and present clutter to create a new relationship in your life”.How does it work in practice? Well, there are a number of rules. You should not have too many paintings of “strong, iconic” but single women in your home cacti are bad because they’re “too spiky”.Bedrooms should be “a boudoir to welcome a man into”, where he feels comfortable and “not squashed out by anything else”. We’d already been told that men can feel threatened by confident women, women earning more than men and women expecting pleasure from sex but “menacing bedside furniture” is a new one.Speaking of bedrooms – books apparently aren’t allowed in there, as they are a room for “sleep and love”. This raises some questions. Does it mean that if you like reading a book in bed you must then go put it back elsewhere in the house just before falling asleep? Is one book (singular) in the bedroom fine but two or more forbidden? What if you do find a partner thanks to your attractive new flat and he also enjoys reading in bed, does this create a loophole? Should you read this singular book together at the same time? Any word on Kindles?Roynon doesn’t expand on these particular quandaries, but does offer more advice on books. As it turns out, a single woman in search of companionship should not own novels with “depressing titles” like Little Deaths or The Suspect.This presumably means that sad or brutal novels with deceptively cheerful titles are AOK. Jonathan Littell’s Holocaust fiction bestseller might have a scene where a soldier bashes the head of a newborn child against a kitchen counter, but it is called The Kindly Ones so on the happy shelf it goes.It is also telling that when it comes to books, we are left with a number of don’ts but no do’s – what we read cannot be in view when we fall asleep and cannot (seem to) be a bummer, but that’s pretty much it.Perhaps we should try to go further. If you are a single woman and would like a man to come to your flat and not run away weeping and screaming, why not let your book collection do the talking for you? Buy 35 copies of Chris Kraus’s I Love Dick and leave them lying around every corner of your house, in places where he will least expect it, so he is constantly reminded of the fact that you’re up for it. It doesn’t matter that the book is about a bit more than that as we’ve established, men only ever look at the covers.Or maybe put Normal People by Sally Rooney in a place where he is sure to spot it. Not only is it a good book, but it will subconsciously tell him that you are, in fact, normal. Just a normal woman, looking for a normal man, so you can be a normal couple together, living in your normal house. Normal, normal, normal. What’s not to love?Actually, scratch that: get rid of all your books. After all, looking for love should be a full-time occupation, and you have a welcoming boudoir you need to get started on. Do consider stuffing your cacti in one of the cushions if endless nonsensical relationship advice catered towards women has taught us anything, it’s that a man likes to be kept on his toes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f14722c01e93370e517b0b041a68e941a600c7/104_714_6276_3766/master/6276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0852cb337a940f07cbff6986e82eb0b7","title":"debenhams announce 40m short term cash injection","story":"Move aims to buy department store time to arrange long-term finance and shop closure plansDebenhams is expected to announce a short-term cash injection of about £40m as it buys more time to arrange a longer-term refinancing and store closure plan.The ailing department store chain, which has 165 outlets and employs 25,000 people, is battling to reach a deal with its banks and bondholders after a difficult Christmas capped off a lacklustre 2018, during which it issued three profit warnings.Lenders have agreed to extend the company’s overdraft limit in an attempt to give it time to refinance its debts, and an announcement about the extension could come as soon as Tuesday. The rescue process is likely to involve the closure of tens of stores and lenders taking a stake in the company.The company has £520m in debt facilities in place including £320m of loans and £200m of bonds, which are due to be repaid next year. Without the short-term overdraft extension it risks breaching the terms on its debt when it faces a test on its financial health at the end of February.Last month Debenhams said it had net debt of £286m. Cashflow has been squeezed as suppliers concerned about the financial health of the company are demanding more up-front payments.The retailer has been sounding out property advisory firms about organising the rapid closure of as many as 50 stores via an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA).Such a route has already been taken by other struggling high street chains including New Look, Mothercare and Carpetright as the whole industry struggles with a combination of rising costs, falling sales and the switch to internet shopping. CVAs can take several weeks to arrange and it is not clear if a deal can be put in place before Debenhams’ quarterly rent day in late March, when it will have to pay out about £50m to landlords.Before Christmas, Sports Direct offered the department store a £40m loan but the company turned it down because it came with a demand for security over some of Debenhams’ assets that would have given Ashley’s company a preferential position over other shareholders.The credit agency Moody’s cut its view on Debenhams to negative last month, saying the company would struggle to refinance its debts without raising new funds. The company had put on hold plans to raise cash by selling its Danish Magasin du Nord chain after failing to receive strong enough offers. After weak sales and pressure on profit margins over Christmas, Moody’s said it expected Debenhams’ underlying profits to fall by up to £20m this year, having previously predicted they would be similar to last year.Pressure on the company ramped up in January when its then chairman, Sir Ian Cheshire, and chief executive, Sergio Bucher, were ousted from the boardroom by Ashley’s Sports Direct and the Dubai-based retail billionaire Micky Jagtiani’s Milestone Resources, which voted against them at its annual shareholder meeting.Cheshire stepped down immediately and was replaced by the interim chairman, Terry Duddy, the former chief executive of Home Retail Group. Bucher has stayed on but is no longer a director."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

His home – a single 10ft x 10ftroom – was right over the wall from the 10th hole of the members-only Bombay Presidency Golf Club, which sprawls across 100 acres of land: prime real estate in a city where the average population density is 31,700 people per sq km.When Mane was just 14, he dropped out of school to become a caddie on the other side of the wall. But it wasn’t until three years later, when he was 17, that he took his first swing, when a club member handed him a 7 iron and told him to have a go. The 150-yard shot changed his life, he says: he realised golf was his shot at fame and glory, the chance of a better life.There was only one problem: the club didn’t allow caddies to play on the course, insisting it would detract from its “exclusivity”. Mane earned his livelihood in a world that wouldn’t allow him to participate. Every night, he would cross back from the verdant, genteel club into his own world of single-room tenements, corrugated tin rooftops and poverty.“My mother’s health was frail and my father had suffered burns when a kerosene stove burst in our kitchen,” he says. “I had no option but to give up school and take up work.”But that didn’t hurt his love for golf. So he and his friends perfected a different game, one they unironically call “slum golf”.Slum golf is exactly what it sounds like: golf played in the narrow streets and alleyways of their informal community. The golfers sometimes dodge the street’s anatomy, but mostly they take advantage of it. Their “teeing ground”, “fairway” and “hazards” include houses, walls, drains, construction debris, parked vehicles, sleeping dogs, garbage dumps, stray cows and potholes. They play with cheap plastic ping pong balls and clubs made from construction rebar, fitted with hosepipe for grips.When Mane and his friends play, they wager 50 rupees (£0.54) a head. Winner takes the spoils.The first hole is outside Mane’s friend Suresh Ramesh Mehboobani’s doorstep. Like Mane, Mehboobani was a caddie while living in the Sindhi Camp slum, this onoriginally a refugee settlement that borders the golf course.“Slum golf is what we do for fun,” Mehboobani says. “It started out as a way to have a go at the game when the club rules didn’t allow caddies to play on the course.”Although the club has since slightly relaxed its rules – it now allows caddies to use the club on Mondays, when it is closed to members – Mehboobani says they still play slum golf “for the fun of it, especially during the monsoon months, when the rains play havoc in Mumbai”.So when the German golfer Norman Dick stumbled upon a YouTube video of Mane and his friends teeing off from a “hole” in the broken, rain-soaked concrete of their city, he immediately saw a younger, more energetic and freewheeling alternative to the stodgy golf played by middle-aged businesspeople, and decided he had to find a way to invite them to Paris for the World Urban Golf Cup.Urban golf is not unlike slum golf: a guerrilla version of the game played in urban settings using the natural obstacles endemic to any city.“In Europe, we have a wonderful community of urban golfers who meet at tournaments that take place on the streets of European cities,” Dick says. “All these tournaments have one thing in common. Everybody who wants to play, can play. Even if you don’t have the money, we find a way.”He got in touch with Mane, Mehboobani and four fellow slum golfers and invited them to Paris to represent India. The European teams playing in the tournament collectively pitched in to pay for the Indian team’s flights, visas and hotel.The tournament took place in September 2018, and of the 10 national teams the Indians came in fifth. Even more than the result, they enjoyed the experience as a glimpse of a life removed from their everyday realities in Mumbai.“What I loved best about Paris is that we felt free. The streets were clean, the traffic was orderly, we could play golf on the streets without a care,” Mehboobani says. “We could even have a beer out in the open. When we stood fifth, the organisers surprised us with tickets to the Ryder Cup, where we got to see Tiger Woods play. That blew us away.”Back in Mumbai, life goes on. Mane turned pro in 2010 and now teaches on the course, while most of his friends still caddie there, waking every morning at 5.30 to attend the lottery draw used to pick the day’s caddies. On a good day they stand to earn 1,000 rupees (£11), tips included.They dream of going pro like Mane, and indeed many professional players on the Indian circuit are former caddies from poor backgrounds. But professional tournaments are expensive to enter, often 50,000 rupees (£550) or more, and while a fortunate few manage to find corporate sponsors, the others must rely on private support from generous club members.Training, too, is expensive and time-consuming. “You need to hit at least 1,000 balls a day as part of your training to go pro,” says Mehboobani. He says it is a luxury most cannot afford.Until then, they play slum golf. Mehboobani is the current undisputed champion.“My dream is to turn pro and win an international tournament,” he says. “Thousands of caddies have come and gone over the decades. No one remembers them. No one knows who they were. I want to win a cup for my club and I want my name up there.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8f64e4ac4cfae80cae371c5306bf4f0fb172966/0_265_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d1bae690c31858b79d9cd7091e3c6c0","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of afternoon","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘afternoon’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘afternoon’.Share your photos of what afternoon means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 13 February at 10am.

Such steep subsidies would not be sustainable but cost reductions in the industry have seen that figure drop to as low as £57.50. The offshore wind industry has previously been criticised for not using enough UK contractors and suppliers.What is the economic benefit to the UK?The industry employs around 11,000 people. One of the side effects of offshore wind’s growth has been an injection of money and jobs into coastal towns that in some cases have big pockets of economic deprivation. Ports have been upgraded and new maintenance facilities built, such as the one at Newhaven in East Sussex for the first windfarm in the English Channel. The different parts of turbines are made across the UK, from the Isle of Wight to Hull.What does the future hold for offshore wind power in the UK?The industry has a target of growing today’s 8GW capacity to 30GW by 2030, which, if achieved, would see offshore wind power supplying more than a third of the UK’s electricity. The government has put a £557m pot of funding aside for subsidies for renewables in the next few years, most of which is expected to be taken up by offshore windfarms. The industry is also hoping for export opportunities for UK firms, as new markets grow in the US and Asia.The size of the project takes the burgeoning offshore wind power sector to a new scale, on a par with conventional fossil fuel-fired power stations.Hornsea One will cover 407 sq km, five times the size of the nearby city of Hull. At 1.2GW of capacity it will power 1m homes, making it about twice as powerful as today’s biggest offshore windfarm once it is completed in the second half of this year.“The ability to generate clean electricity offshore at this scale is a globally significant milestone at a time when urgent action needs to be taken to tackle climate change,” said Matthew Wright, UK managing director of Ørsted, the world’s biggest offshore windfarm builder.The power station is only the first of four planned in the area, with a green light and subsidies already awarded to a second stage due for completion in the early 2020s.The first two phases will use 7MW turbines, which are taller than London’s Gherkin building.But the latter stages of the Hornsea development could use even more powerful, 10MW-plus turbines. Bigger turbines will capture more of the energy from the wind and should lower costs by reducing the number of foundations and amount of cabling firms need to put into the water.Henrik Poulsen, Ørsted’s chief executive, said he was in close dialogue with major manufacturers to use the new generation of turbines, some of which are expected to approach the height of the Shard in London, the tallest building in the EU.Offshore windfarms could help ministers fill the low carbon power gap created by Hitachi and Toshiba scrapping nuclear plants, the executive suggested. “If nuclear should play less of a role than expected, I believe offshore wind can step up,” he said.The turbines for Hornsea One are built and shipped from Siemens Gamesa’s factory in Hull, part of a web of UK-based suppliers that has sprung up around the growing sector.Around half of the project’s transition pieces, the yellow part of the structure that connects the foundation to the tower, are made in Teeside. Many of the towers themselves are made by a firm in Campbeltown in the Scottish highlands. Altogether, about half of the components for the project are made in the UK.Ørsted is not yet ready to bid for a share of a £60m pot of further offshore windfarm subsidies, to be auctioned by the government this summer, but expects the price to reach even more competitive levels than those seen in 2017.Like other international energy companies, Ørsted has put in place contingency planning in event of a no-deal Brexit – but the hope is that will not come to pass. “We want a Brexit deal that will facilitate an orderly transition out of the union,” said Poulsen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d85e674404e9eb32fd6676b55f4af47752165f0/0_93_2768_1661/master/2768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caa8d28b1cfd345f7ad3334182994127","title":"malcolm mcdowell mike figgis on hero albert finney","story":"Spying on Michael Douglas, telling Nic Cage how to play drunk, pretending he was gay to Audrey Hepburn … two giants of cinema remember their hero Albert FinneyThe first time I met Albert, he shook my hand and said: “You have a very interesting face,” in that famous Northern lilt of his. I’ll never forget it as long as I live. It was in 1968, on the set of Lindsay Anderson’s If…, which Albert produced and which was my breakthrough. I didn’t tell him then but he was my hero: when I saw him in Saturday Night, Sunday Morning, as a young man in Liverpool, it made me realise that I could could be an actor, too.During that period British films were mainly bourgeois middle-class, middle-of-the-road comedies where you sat on the sofa with a cup of tea. Albert was the most influential actor of his generation because he made it possible for actors from the provinces to make it – indeed, he made it good to be working class.There had been no leading man before like him: he epitomised what John Osborne was writing about in Look Back in Anger: this “fuck you” attitude to the establishment – which we loved and needed. If you came from the provinces at that time, it was very intimidating to try and make it in London. In music, the path had been softened by the Beatles, but in film and theatre it was still very hard. Albert made it possible – along with his contemporaries, like Tom Courtenay and Alan Bates.But for me at least, he was the great shining light. He had this mix of boyish northern charm and, just below the surface, a wild, unpredictable danger – devilment, even – which audiences really responded to. You never quite knew what he was going to do next.He wasn’t really like that in person. He loved his great food and great wines. I remember a four-hour boozy lunch with him in Soho with my dear sister, Gloria, and his then-girlfriend, Pene. It was wonderful. And then he would go off to a fat farm to get ready for the next movie.A lot of the best stories about Albert are not repeatable. He was irresistible to beautiful women – which he loved. And he was mischievous. It’s not a very politically-correct story, but I remember him telling me about the time the director Stanley Donen introduced him to Audrey Hepburn. They were to star together in this Hollywood romance, Two For the Road, and had dinner in a bistro in Chelsea. And Albert played it completely limp-wristed, lisping and gay. Audrey was absolutely horrified. When Albert excused himself at the end of the meal, she turned to Stanley and said: “What are you doing? This has to be a great love affair!” and he went: “Oh, he’s just joking.” Then Albert came back with that great big grin on his face and Audrey said: “You bastard!” That was Albert.He was also a very private man – he never courted the press. He wasn’t egotistical: I remember going to see him at the National when he played Don Pedro in Much Ado About Nothing. He didn’t always need to take the leading role – though, of course, you couldn’t take your eyes off him. He was an authentic, great talent. That’s important – and rare.I hope in some sense he passed a baton to me, with If… and then with O Lucky Man!, just as Gary Oldman once told me it was seeing those films which made him want to be an actor. I feel very indebted and close to Albert still. I’ll miss him very much. • As told to Catherine ShoardIt was day one on the shoot of The Browning Version in 1994. Albert was sitting with the script, using a thick black marker pen to cross out sections of text. I asked him if he was making dialogue changes. “No, I’m just crossing out all those directions that say, ‘He looks up sadly’, or ‘He holds back the emotion.’ I’ll make those decisions myself when I do the scene.”In the film, Albert’s character has to deal with a series of humiliations – we were filming one such scene. In my script (by the great writer Ronald Harwood) it did suggest a tearful face. We’d done a couple of takes and Albert’s face was noticeably dry. I asked if we should perhaps do one with moisture. Albert was never rude or high-handed. He just opened his script and pointed out that 10 pages later comes the big scene where he finally breaks down. I apologised and we quickly moved on to the next scene.I met Albert when I was trying to raise money for my first film, Stormy Monday. He’d always been my favourite British actor and I was in awe of him. Charlie Bubbles and Under the Volcano demonstrated his great acting skills as well as a sense that he was one of the most interesting artists on the British scene, not just an actor but a style-maker.We went for lunch somewhere trendy. I remember it was just a few days after the Chernobyl disaster. Michael Douglas was at a nearby table. Our food arrived, the talk was fascinating and I was in heaven. Albert leaned forward confidentially: “Don’t make it obvious but can you tell me if Michael Douglas is eating potatoes?” I looked: his plate was minimal, just a steak and some greens. Albert nodded: “I thought so. He still takes his clothes off in movies.”When we wrapped The Browning Version, Albert told me he’d enjoyed the process and hoped we might do it again, but that he never watched his films or went to festivals. During the shoot, he’d taken every member of the cast and crew out to dinner in groups of about five or six. At the wrap party, he gave everyone a bottle of wine – a fine wine, not some cheap plonk. Such a generous guy.The film was selected for competition at Cannes and the festival director, Gilles Jacob, buttonholed me on the Croisette, urging me to persuade Albert to attend, as he was a dead cert to win the best actor award. Albert was hard to track down as he’d decided not to bother with an agent. Finally we spoke: “Tell Gilles Jacob I’m having a baby,” he said. Albert loved the gee-gees and one of his lady horses was foaling on a stud farm in Ireland. Jacob was not amused: “Zen he does not win ze prize.” (I often ponder on the implied politics.)We remained friends after the film. I was prepping Leaving Las Vegas and Nic Cage was dead-set on doing the film drunk. I asked Albert’s advice over lunch, as I regard his performance in John Huston’s Under the Volcano as definitive. “To play drunk, never overact,” he said. “A drunk puts a glass down with such care and delicacy, the movements become mannered, not exaggerated. If you want the sense of alcohol, keep a small glass of scotch on hand and before each take dip your finger in it and wet your lips.’” I passed the advice on to Nic verbatim. Some of it stuck.Albert was our finest actor, a man of discreet wisdom, compassion and incredible ability. His voice was as beautiful as his face – and his heart. He left a great legacy and his death is a great loss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6a3c3991d1ad41391ea090f81f25473f8e8cd1b/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce1ffe6c79c5c3d5574c7192ce98e96d","title":"mr jones review agnieszka holland james norton berlin film festival","story":"Agnieszka Holland’s powerful drama stars James Norton as the real-life Welsh journalist who uncovered Stalin’s genocidal famine in UkraineAgnieszka Holland’s Mr Jones is a bold and heartfelt movie with a real Lean-ian sweep. First-time screenwriter Andrea Chalupa has been inspired by her grandfather from eastern Ukraine to script this forthright, valuable drama about Stalin’s genocidal famine there, and the courageous Welsh journalist Gareth Jones who first brought it to the world’s attention in the 1930s. This was despite real personal danger in journeying there covertly – and the subsequent disparagement of Stalin’s lickspittle New York Times correspondent in Moscow, Walter Duranty, a man whom posterity has revealed to be a singularly useless idiot.James Norton brings his A-game to this film, giving a muscular, sympathetic performance as Jones, the idealist intellectual and man of action from Barry in Wales, who has a liking for reciting the medieval Welsh poem The Battle of the Trees and never removes his sweetly owlish spectacles. Peter Sarsgaard is the creepy Duranty and Joseph Mawle has a recurring cameo as George Orwell who was said to be inspired by Jones’s work and might even have named “Mr Jones”, the proprietor of Animal Farm, after him. Jones and Orwell don’t appear to have met in person, but the film imagines a lunch encounter, based on the fact that they shared a London literary agent: Leonard Moore. The movie has also created what appear to be fictional invention composites: chiefly a colleague of Duranty’s called Ada Brooks, played by Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret from the Netflix series The Crown).Holland’s film begins slowly, even unassumingly as young Jones – having already made a splash by interviewing Hitler – uses his London government contacts with David Lloyd George (Kenneth Cranham) to get official permissions to travel to the Soviet Union, on a mission to interview Stalin and discover the truth about the USSR’s colossal economic expansion and its apparently triumphant five-year plan. At first, Jones is restricted to Moscow, condemned to hang around the louche and cynical journo-expat scene presided over there by Duranty. But then he escapes to make a dangerous and deeply unofficial trip to Ukraine, which is where his nightmare begins.At first, the movie is weirdly like The Third Man, with Jones as the Holly Martins figure, the writer in a strange town, having been promised something interesting by someone who is disturbingly no longer around. But by the end of the film it is more like Heart of Darkness. He befriends Ada (Kirby) who wearily tolerates the secret service man following her around as her “big brother”, and Jones is unnerved by a man at one of Duranty’s creepy parties saying that the ennui-stricken hedonistic atmosphere is like Poe’s The Masque of the Red Death.When Jones arrives in the desolate, snowy wastes of eastern Ukraine, he finds out the truth about what Stalin is doing – and perhaps the fact that this is still not well known adds to the horror. There is an excellent and disturbing scene in which Jones is confronted by five tiny children in snowy woodland who sing an eerie song to him about Stalin, and about how cold and hungry and yet loyal they are. It has a sinister, hypnotic effect. Jones is to become tormented by hunger, even gnawing at tree bark. Finally a thin-faced family share their supper with him, which turns out to be the worst horror of all.The movie is partly about Jones’s personal nightmare and his anguish when he was at first disbelieved. But it is also about his final vindication, which perhaps doesn’t have the same power although it’s a necessary part of the story.Holland’s movie really lets rip in the final act, the ordeal in the wasteland of Ukraine. She has a real story to tell – a story that isn’t told enough – and a single, compelling and likable character with which to tell it. It’s a picture with sinew and strength."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

As the woman behind the counter pushed the extremely small lump of cheese through the grater, sliced the dusty pink mortadella and scooped from a veined round of gorgonzola, there was chatter – about the uncollected rubbish reeking by the side of the market, a grandchild, but mostly about the gorgonzola itself, and how much the woman’s husband hated it as much as she adored it. We were four in line, one woman twitching with impatience, but that didn’t matter – there was a tub containing about 600g of gorgonzola to be sealed and a story to finish.There are many stories as to the origins of gorgonzola. Franco Angeli recounts the most likely in his thorough and serious book about Italian cheese, Il Grande Patrimonio. At some point in the sixth century, in a town called gorgonzola, an unnamed Lombardian innkeeper found some forgotten rounds of stracchino – a simple cheese traditionally made from the milk of cows after they return stracce (tired) from the high pastures of Valsassina. Forgotten, the rounds had developed musty coats and thin veins of mould within. The innkeeper declared his discovery delectable, and christened it erborinato, a term which probably comes from Lombardian dialect for parsley, for the green-blue marbling that ran through the newly born cheese.For quite some time, the discovery was simply called stracchino verde or stracchino di gorgonzola. It was only at the start of the last century that it became gorgonzola, and was granted the cheese equivalent of a knighthood – DOC or protected status – in 1955.The Milanese food writer Anna Del Conte describes the traditional process well, how gorgonzola is made from both the hot and cold curds of two milkings, how penicillium is added along with the rennet, and the curds pressed into 30cm rounds. Fine needles are then inserted into the rounds, and these holes encourage and help the mould spores to do their thing and grow green-blue-grey veins that marble through the cheese.Gorgonzola was famously aged in the grotte (caves) of Valsassina and Val Brembana, alpine valleys near Milan. Some small producers and farmers still work in this way, continuing to age gorgonzola in mysterious, dark caves, but mostly these conditions are recreated in factories.There are two sorts of gorgonzola. Gorgonzola piccante, as the name suggests, is feisty and piquant the prominent veins in this firmer, at times crumbly, cheese have a musty tang and bite – even a slightly metallic note. Dolce means sweet, and, although it is not actually sweet, gorgonzola dolce is certainly sweeter in nature, the veins lighter both in look and taste, and pleasantly tangy next to the creamy cheese.Salty-sweet blue cheese with its pointed tang craves bitter flavours, according to food writer Niki Segnit, author of The Flavour Thesaurus. She is right, which is why sage, with its inherent musty bitterness, works so well here – as do the optional toasted walnuts, milky but with their slight nicotine-like bitterness, also adding a rubble of texture to the rich sauce. This is a luxurious dishy dish, which – if both people in the couple love gorgonzola as much as they love each other – could be just the thing for February 14th (just don’t choke on a walnut).500g fresh or dried egg tagliatelle30g butter1 garlic clove, peeled and thinly sliced6-8 sage leaves75g gorgonzola, cubed100ml double creamSalt and black pepper1 handful shelled walnuts, roughly choppedBring a large pan of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook as per packet instructions.

Especially when you have people around you doing bad things.”More than a month away from celebrating his 19th birthday, the first player born this millennium to represent England and a trailblazer for his generation is holding court at Borussia Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion. Dressed in a turquoise green tracksuit and immaculate matching trainers, the unassuming Sancho does not come across as the most coveted teenager in world football as he makes a point of shaking hands with every journalist around the table with the greeting, “nice to meet you”. Clearly at ease in his surroundings in western Germany as he prepares for his return to London to face Tottenham in the Champions League on Wednesday, he is taller and broader in the shoulders than this time last year something the makers of the Fifa video game may want to take note of. “I am stronger than it says,” he says, laughing. The boy from the Guinness Trust Buildings estate who left home at 12 has now become a man.“For the kids that are in south London I hope I can give a positive message,” he adds, intently. “Don’t do those bad things. You don’t have to be footballers. You could focus on your school work. Education is the most important thing and a lot of kids in south London get distracted from education.”Had he not been blessed with a talent with the ball that convinced his headteacher at Crampton primary school he was destined to be a star when she first saw him as a five-year-old, Sancho knows his story could have turned out very differently. Eight goals – including the brilliant finish from a tight angle in Saturday’s 3-3 draw with Hoffenheim – and nine assists in the Bundesliga this season have allowed Lucien Favre’s vibrant young Dortmund side to dream of winning a first title since 2012. His bold decision to reject a new contract with Manchester City worth £30,000-a-week and move to Germany in search of first-team football is proving a masterstroke.Yet just like on the pitch, where his outstanding skill and dribbling speed have made him a social media sensation and earned comparisons with Neymar, Sancho has always been prepared to take risks. Having joined Watford aged seven, he would travel across London three nights a week to train and was later persuaded to leave his friends and family behind to join the club’s affiliated school, Harefield Academy in Uxbridge, west London.“I didn’t really want to go to that boarding school,” Sancho reflects nearly seven years on. “I wanted to stay at home and travel but the people around me told me what was best and I listened to them. I am happy that I am here today, where I am.”Now sharing an apartment with his father, Sean, a former security guard, near Dortmund’s impressive home, Sancho is in regular touch with his mother and friends back in Kennington and says he is enjoying life in “a chilled city”, even if he admits “learning German will be always kind of hard to me. But I’m getting the basics right,” he adds with enthusiasm, “working up on speaking German in training. I know what the manager is saying in training sessions, which makes it easier for me and for the players also: that’s how you interact, you come together more.“Me being so comfortable being abroad is due to the fact I’ve always been away from home. When I first left home it was very difficult, because I wasn’t used to it, I was always with my mum. The first couple of years were very tough and then as I got older people started to tell me: ‘It’s either this or going back home.’ And I always loved football, so I always chose the hard option. That’s what’s made me more comfortable being away from home than other people, so I’m kind of lucky.”Last month, Chelsea rejected a bid of £35m from Bayern Munich for Callum Hudson-Odoi that would have made him the most expensive British teenager. Germany’s most successful club remain confident of signing him in the summer and it is no exaggeration to say that Sancho’s impact at Dortmund since he was handed Ousmane Dembélé’s No 7 shirt in 2017 has been a major influence in their determination to sign his former England Under‑17 teammate.BVB’s sporting director, Michael Zorc, said it was during a youth international that they first became aware of Sancho’s extraordinary ability and subsequently made every effort to persuade him to leave City.But having come up against his childhood friend Reiss Nelson against Hoffenheim on Saturday – the 19-year-old is on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season – and with several other English teenagers starting to follow in Sancho’s slipstream as opportunities for young players in the Premier League continue to be scarce, he is quick to explain that the adaptation has taken time.“It hasn’t been easy. I’ve had to work for this. Everyone around me is keeping me grounded and keeping me focused. I’m improving every day and Marco Reus, Mario Götze and Axel Witsel are great role models to me and everyone else in the team. It’s really nice to have them around telling me what to do, and what’s not good, helping me solve things I wouldn’t solve by myself, so I’m happy.”Sancho won his first senior England cap against Croatia in October and was visited in Dortmund last week by Gareth Southgate’s assistant, Steve Holland. He is expected to be part of the squad that will face the Netherlands in June in the Nations League semi-final in Portugal but says being out of the spotlight in another country has allowed him to keep a distance from the developing hype surrounding him back home.“I’m not aware at all,” he says. “Obviously I’ve seen Twitter things, but I don’t know how … I don’t ask questions really, I just stay focused on what I’m doing and just keep going forward. All this media. This is all new to me. This is all crazy. I never knew you could be so known over your success. I thought if you are doing well everyone talks obviously, the fans, but I never knew they would take so much interest, but this helps a young player, the media training. It helps them out but this is the biggest thing. This is crazy.”It must be said that his innocence is rather endearing. Sancho also barely seems able to believe that he will be back in his home city to play against Tottenham in the first leg of their last-16 tie in Europe’s premier club competition. Thirty members of his family and close friends will be at Wembley to see whether Dortmund can gain revenge for losing home and away to Spurs in the group stages last season.“I feel like we have improved so it won’t be the same match as last year. It will be more difficult for them. Especially as they have some big players missing out so it is going to be a tough one,” Sancho says.“It’s a great feeling. I’ll be playing in front of my family, which is something I’ve always wanted to do since I was a young boy. Now I’m able to do it and hopefully I can show London people what I’m about. Everyone was messaging me saying: ‘I need a ticket!’ It’s big. I’m just happy that I’m playing in the Champions League. It is a big thing for me like it is for every player. That’s the biggest stage in the world so I’ve got to keep on working hard and hopefully I will get many more chances.”As well as his quick feet and mesmerising ball control, Sancho attributes his fearless attitude to the hours and hours of cage matches he played as a child on the estate in Kennington. He plans to return to Crampton and Harefield at the end of the season to answer questions from pupils and is clearly passionate about giving something back to the community that helped raise him.Eloquent, intelligent and with the world at his feet, Sancho is certainly a decent role model for any child of the 21st century."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/970c4305c6205b98d06cad50ef78f599bb52d326/490_182_1581_948/master/1581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1668e0f477e416ef027c8345c5337f4","title":"maurizio sarri month chelsea malmo europa league","story":"• Europa League takes on added significance for Blues• Chelsea have still to score an away goal in 2019Maurizio Sarri’s fate as Chelsea’s head coach will in effect be determined over the remainder of this month as the Italian seeks to convince the club’s hierarchy that he can recover some poise and still deliver Champions League qualification for next season.Sunday’s humiliating 6-0 thrashing at Manchester City, Chelsea’s worst defeat since 1991 and a loss which confirmed a drop from fourth to sixth place, has left Sarri clinging to his position only seven months into a three-year deal. The head coach will hope progress in the Europa League, starting with Thursday’s knockout tie at Malmö, earns him time, given the competition’s winners gain entry into next season’s Champions League.Yet eliminating the side who finished third in the Swedish league last season would only marginally bolster his job prospects unless a team clearly struggling to come to terms with his tactical demands can improve their performances over a daunting run of domestic fixtures.Chelsea face Manchester United in the fifth round of the FA Cup, Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final and Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League before the month is out, games in which the board will expect to see reasons for optimism. Any decision over Sarri’s future would still be taken by Roman Abramovich, despite the fact the owner has not attended a game this season and now spends the vast majority of his time in Russia and Israel.The director Marina Granovskaia remains his eyes and ears at the club and was instrumental in the appointment of the Italian last summer. Sarri’s post-match suggestion at the Etihad Stadium, delivered to his country’s media, that he “never hears” from Abramovich was apparently not considered as a slight against the owner.Yet there was risk attached when he appeared to echo his predecessor Antonio Conte’s regular complaints about a lack of contact with the real power at the club, even if it is understood that, should Sarri indicate he wishes to speak face to face with Abramovich, a meeting could be arranged. Whether the team’s cluttered schedule would grant the Italian the time to travel abroad and meet the Russian, however, is open to question.Sarri, whose side have yet to score away from Stamford Bridge this calendar year having been soundly beaten at Arsenal and Bournemouth prior to the embarrassment at City, was back at the club’s Cobham training ground late morning on Mondayto oversee his players’ brief warm-down session before preparations began for the last-32 tie in Sweden.The squad split between the gym and work outside on the training pitch, with a small-sided game overseen by the head coach, with the mood described as “workmanlike” by one observer.The hierarchy will now demand a positive response. They have consistently put out experienced sides in the Europa League this season, albeit often using senior players otherwise on the fringes, and that is unlikely to change this week given the importance now heaped on progress in the competition. There remains the potential for the much maligned Jorginho to sit out that tie, with Mateo Kovacic having been employed in his midfield brief at times during recent games, but a full-strength squad is still expected to travel to Malmö.Frank Lampard, who has been mooted as a potential successor, not least in the wake of the success instigated by Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Manchester United in recent months, moved to distance himself from the position on Monday. “Chelsea are certainly a club I respect, and have a manager I respect,” said the Derby County manager. “My job is here and I’m working very hard. All my thoughts are on Ipswich Town away on Wednesday. I hope to see Chelsea put some form together and turn their results around.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/081acd9773e5a117de5a4feda3cb359d2bfb1eb7/0_40_2983_1789/master/2983.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0feeeb2d6cb42e7069d9b2b89a7be180","title":"wolves newcastle premier league match report","story":"Rafael Benítez must hate it when the fourth official holds up the board for added time against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Just as Matt Doherty had headed a winner in the 94th minute at St James’ Park in December, so Newcastle United were again undone by a last-gasp goal as Willy Boly headed in Adama Traoré’s deep cross in the 95th.Boly was able to head beyond a flapping Martin Dubravka in an aerial duel at the back post but once Benítez had moved beyond his disappointment, the Newcastle manager should still take great heart from the resolve his side displayed as Isaac Hayden’s rare goal earned United the draw that lifts them a point above the relegation zone.Benítez initially said his goalkeeper should have defended Traoré’s high cross better before revealing his true feelings. “In England they don’t understand the rules,” he said. “It was already the 94th minute so you can say too many things that won’t change what happened, like we couldn’t change in the first game. I’m obviously disappointed but very happy with the performance of the team.”Asked to clarify if he believed the referee, Graham Scott, had made a mistake, he added: “The six-yard box is there to protect the keeper. You have to protect the keeper. We have been here for years and it’s still very difficult to explain that.”The concession of the late goal added insult to injury for Benítez, clearly still holding a grudge for the events at St James’s where he believed Boly should have been dismissed for elbowing Ayoze Pérez in Wolves’ penalty area. “I think we have to be really disappointed with the way we concede in both games against this team,” he added. “After an elbow in the face of my player and a penalty not given and then we concede today, you can analyse it. But I’m really disappointed to concede this way against a good team.”Wolves may have been thwarted in their bid to chalk up a fourth successive top-flight victory for the first time since 1972 but refreshed by their warm-weather training trip to Marbella, they still strengthened their hold on seventh place in the Premier League and now turn their attention to the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Bristol City.The uneasy peace between Benítez and the Newcastle United hierarchy could yet lead to happier times. Not only has the manager been able to find a formula that has also brought victories over Cardiff City and Manchester City, he has also been able to introduce a £21m attacking presence and Miguel Almirón came off the bench to applause almost as rapturous as that greeting Hayden’s first goal since October 2017. Benítez has made it plain that talk of his Newcastle future must wait till the summer. But at least a thaw seems to be in evidence.Wolves, with five wins from their previous seven games, were the dominant team in the first period, with Raúl Jiménez, eight goals from his last 11 starts, doing everything but score. The manner in which he took the long route to get past DeAndre Yedlin and Fabian Schär before unleashing a shot that Dubravka was happy to save was indicative of his soaring confidence.Newcastle finished the half the stronger, however, Salomón Rondón running on to Pérez’s clever angled pass and managing a shot that only went wide after Conor Coady’s tackle. Eleven minutes after the restart, it was a similar through ball that set up their goal.It is 16 months since Hayden last scored but when Boly was caught on his heels as Schär strode forward and played a pass down the inside-right channel, the midfielder showed no hesitation as he shot powerfully home at the near post, exposing Rui Patrício’s early decision to e the other way.Hayden would have been an unlikely hero. Having had requests to leave rejected in each of the past two transfer windows, to move south to be nearer his infant daughter, he may just have played a crucial part in Newcastle’s effort to stay up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9291da56d82ae5be0136275244cb4984b52b0cea/0_0_1800_1349/master/1800.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4f7ad4e269776dd5c2d8528c876c1c90 1400w","title":"how busy famous people manage sleep cope work odd hours","story":"Today presenter Martha Kearney goes to bed at 8pm, while at 4am Toyah Willcox is going through her emails – 10 people with odd work patterns reveal their bedtime routines I have always found sleep to be a physiological necessity for my mind and body to recover – a good sleep has a significantly positive impact on my sense of wellbeing the next day.

My job as an interventional cardiologist means that I am often called into the hospital from home after midnight to deal with patients having heart attacks.

I had a particularly challenging night recently when I was called in three times to deal with heart attacks and cardiac arrests. I felt too fatigued to go in for a routine day the next morning.One of the challenges we face as doctors is to recognise when we should or shouldn’t be working. To make high-quality decisions for patient care, including for procedure-led specialities, you have to maintain a sharp focus. As a consultant, I also have to provide leadership to staff around me and communicate well with patients and their families.Routine: To help me sleep, I like to exercise.

This really helps me as I do stretching exercises. I write in my journal every night – it can be anything from random thoughts to reflections of gratitude. I avoid screens before bedtime and read 10-20 pages every night. Usually I fall asleep quickly but sometimes I use 4-7-8 breathing exercises to help me.Breakfast show presenter on BBC Asian NetworkI’m definitely a bad sleeper and found it very difficult to overcome once I was given the breakfast slot. I decided to join yoga classes to help me unwind and relax. I train at the gym regularly so that I know I will be tired enough by the end of the day to naturally want to sleep. Routine: Changing the ambience of my home has been important. To make it a more relaxed atmosphere, I have calmrelaxation music playing through my speakers and light candles around the room. These little things make big differences. And I also make sure I am not doing too much throughout the day. I’ve learned to put myself first and bear in mind that health literally is wealth.Singer and actorI have always had disrupted, broken sleep. Over a year, I could count on my fingers the times I have slept through the night. I don’t think my insomnia is fixable: I think it’s in my DNA. I cannot emphasise enough how important exercise is. I have to do at least a three-mile fast walk a day, usually in the afternoon. Movement is incredibly important in helping my body use up my energy. When I’m disciplined enough, detoxing of stimulants and exercising is also a conscious part of my day. Routine: I take books on learning to bed – music theory, colour theory – and usually my brain thinks, “Um, I think I’d rather turn off,” than learn something. But my natural pattern is to sleep from 11pm-1am, then I’m awake till 7am and I only get into deep sleep at around 7-10am. Instead of lying there praying to go to sleep all night, I get up and work. At 4am you do feel a bit jet-lagged and brain-dead, but it’s a very practical time to go through my emails, pay the bills, get rid of the mundane tasks. And there’s times in the summer when I’m awake as the sun is rising and I think this is the best, this is absolutely wonderful. Of course, if you have a 9-5 job this is a real problem, but as a singer, it can work well for me.At my operational unit, the shift pattern is two early mornings, two late afternoons and two nights, followed by four days off. This requires you to swing your body clock forwards and back by 12 hours at least twice a week, so there is always going to be an effect on your sleep. I’m an expert napper and don’t find it odd to be sleeping at any time of the day or night. The key to coping with such varied shift work is to embrace the inevitable changes to your lifestyle – don’t fight it. I try to be kind to myself and plan my life activities around what sleep I can expect the next night. A lot of people struggle with staying asleep for long enough after a night shift to feel refreshed.Routine: My tip would be that you should prepare for sleep the moment you leave work. I wear sunglasses on the way home (as long as it’s safe to do so) and ask my husband to leave all the curtains closed. I would recommend going through all the little things you would normally do. For example, if you like a hot drink before bed or to read a book, then do so, and wear your most comfortable pyjamas and some warm socks – comfort really is king.Everybody asks me about my sleep pattern, so my friend Ben had a T-shirt printed for me. One side reads: “Actually I don’t mind getting up at 3.30am.” The other side says: “Thank you for asking.”But luckily I am a lark. I used to find working on Newsnight really exhausting – live on air at 10.30pm, then a few drinks afterwards with the producers in the Green Room. It was often hard to get to sleep afterwards. A low point came one night after work when I found myself watching Big Brother live – the contestants were all asleep. I definitely get less sleep as I get older.Working on the Today show has had an effect too – it is very odd going to bed at 8pm, especially on New Year’s Eve. Getting to sleep on the first night in a run of shifts is tricky.Routine: I use an eye mask to block out the light, spray the pillow with lavender and put the radio on a timer. I also set three alarm clocks for 3.15am, after one morning when I overslept…Sleep is so unbelievably important in offshore sailing, probably the most important thing, in fact. Plenty of studies have shown what sleep deprivation does to you. When you apply that to solo offshore sailing, it becomes even more relevant. There is such a fine line in this sport between sleeping too little and underperforming or making errors as a result, and sleeping too much and compromising your performance.If I don’t get enough sleep on a race, the consequences are huge. Physically, it can make you more susceptible to things such as sea sickness. But more than that, there’s a point where everything compounds and your body just says “no”. But it’s amazing what the body can do. My philosophy on sleep is to listen to your body. It’s all about cognitive function. When I’m sleep deprived, I stop making good decisions. I also have type 1 diabetes. Obviously that can be very difficult with offshore sailing, but it’s supposed to be challenging and it certainly isn’t impossible. I enjoy proving that it can be done.Routine: How much sleep I get at sea will depend on the length and nature of the race. If I compete in a race over 24 hours, I won’t sleep at all. For a three-day race, I’ll sleep a little but not much. For races over three days, I’ll try to get some sleep from the beginning so that I don’t overexert myself too early on. Generally, I’ll sleep 20-40 minutes every 2-3 hours. The longest I’ll sleep at any one time will be 40 minutes and, if you take a race like the Route du Rhum, which I’ve just finished, that was over 18 days. The longest I’ve stayed awake during a race is probably about 62 hours.Author of Why We DreamWhen I was 22, I went through a period of pretty debilitating insomnia. I was sleeping only a few hours a night and I was basically miserable all the time. I got through that, thankfully, but I never took sleep for granted again. In 2011, I happened to find a book by lucid dream pioneer Stephen LaBerge, and I used his techniques to induce lucid dreams (dreams where you are aware within the dream that you are dreaming). I found that experience mind-boggling, and wanted to learn more about what’s going on in the brain during lucid dreams as well as regular dreams.I started keeping a dream journal, and the entries quickly got longer and more detailed. Training myself to recall more of my dreams has improved my relationship with sleep. It’s helped me appreciate that sleep isn’t some dead zone – we’re still thinking, fantasising, feeling. I went from being anxious about going to sleep to being excited to find out what I’d dream.Routine: We dream every time we have a REM cycle – four or five times a night – even if we forget most of them. Devoting a minute or two a day to thinking about dreams, or a pre-bed thought for your intention to remember them, can improve your dream recall. But the easiest way is to keep a dream journal and write in it first thing in the morning – before making coffee, before looking at your phone, before getting out of bed. Any bodily motion or engagement with the physical environment can jolt you out of your internal world and erase your memories from the night.I love sleep. I value it a lot and I am very careful to ensure I get enough. I think most people are guilty of underestimating the power of sleep. But as an athlete, sleep becomes even more important. We need sleep to recover, to recharge, to train harder, to get better at our sport. It’s easy to view sleep as a necessity rather than value it as something that contributes to your wellbeing. I think a lot of people have an unhealthy relationship with sleep in a world that seems to be getting busier and busier, we often seem to be resenting the fact that it’s necessary.Routine: I generally go to bed pretty early and rarely struggle to get to sleep. I don’t use my phone in bed – I think that is the best tip I could give anyone. Having a good sleep routine leading into a competition really helps. I know I’m going in off a good bank of sleep, so if I have a bad sleep the night before, then that’s OK. I see little point in getting stressed about not being able to sleep. I also know that I can perform well after a bad night’s sleep because I’ve done it before. When I do a bake shift, I’m in from 3am to 10.30am. Those solitary night-time hours are my favourite. I get to play music and work to my own rhythm, unsupervised. There’s no better feeling than rewarding yourself for all your hard work with an early breakfast of an oven-hot baguette and butter. The hours fly past so quickly and by the time everyone else is waking up, my working day is almost finished. Walking out of the bakery into daylight makes me feel like I’ve somehow cheated the system and blagged myself a whole day off. The only downside is it can feel a bit like jet lag without having had the holiday.You have to have a very rich inner life to be a baker. I’ve struggled with adapting my social life to my working schedule. Having a few days in my week where I have to say no to any plans due to early starts was tough to begin with, especially at weekends. I’ve struggled to find people willing to go out dancing with me on a Monday evening! Routine: If I’ve had a day off before an early shift, I always make sure I get enough fresh air and exercise to be able to fall asleep early-ish the evening before. There’s no point in trying to get seven hours of sleep in as I’ll just end up lying awake for hours, but the first shift of the week is usually easy to get through on willpower alone. Once I’m back into the rhythm of the week, I’ll be so tired it’s easy to fall asleep at 6pm. Luckily, there’s an abundance of carbs and coffee and cake to keep me going through a long shift when I’m at work.Editor of Bedtime Stories for Grown-UpsOnce I became a parent I realised that, just as the human race is the most profoundly arrogant species to ignore billions of years of evolution and disregard its light-dark cycles, so can we grownups be very hypocritical when it comes to the bedtime routine we adopt for ourselves, as opposed to that we impose on children.Routine: I would never dream – pun intended – of letting my kids use a device immediately before lights-out. My wife and I like to get them settled in bed early. We read together most nights (they are 10-year-old twins) – a story or a chapter of a book.The oral storytelling tradition has prevailed since Ancient Greece and the bedtime variant is its most precious iteration. Moreover, various fairytale archetypes – such as that behind Jack and the Beanstalk – have been shown to date back more than 5,000 years. This is all quite primal stuff. Bedtime stories are a powerful, beautiful thing for a family and beneficial to all parties on every level. A good story told well, either aloud or not, takes the mind off things by rounding out the day’s own narrative.As for the perfect bedtime story? Nothing too compulsive – you do need to be able to put the book down – nor stressful. Ideally it should be something far-removed from work, too. And definitely nothing about Brexit.

But forging new, lasting connections can be simpleWe let chances to make friends pass us by every day, says Kate Leaver in her book The Friendship Cure. She advises having the courage to take small steps as and when opportunities arise. “Instead of forcing a little small talk with your kindly neighbour,” she says, “ask them in for a cuppa and get to know them. Instead of leaving a party without contact details for your friend’s boyfriend’s sister, add her on Facebook and ask her for coffee some time … You’ll be surprised by how many potential friends there already are in your orbit.”Joining a group, club or class is an effective way to meet people. “Teaming up for a shared activity, project or goal is an experience that can promote bonding and closer connections,” says therapist Miriam Kirmayer. Pursue a challenge or skill you are passionate about, because then you will have a good time and feel more at ease striking up a conversation.It can be scary trying to make friends. What if your overtures are rejected? Leaver and Kirmayer say that a degree of vulnerability is needed in trying to strike up friendships. Put plainly, keeping yourself to yourself isn’t going to help you. Sharing recommendations or letting others in on plans, says Kirmayer, are simple ways to share, which will help build closeness and trust.“Social media can be hugely beneficial for making friends as an adult,” says Kirmayer. Apps such as Bumble BFF (the dating app’s friendship arm) and Peanut (which connects mothers in a local area) can be a good starting point, suggests Kirmayer, as can platforms such as Meetup, where you can sign up to local activities and events. But, she adds, social media does not replace personal interactions: “The more we rely on apps, the less practice we have with the kinds of conversations and experiences that really allow us to create close friendships, as opposed to superficial connections.”As we age, our friendships inevitably shift. According to a 2016 study, we hit our peak number of friendships at the age of 25. When trying to make friends as an adult, clinical psychologist Linda Blair advises not putting too much pressure on any new connections and not expecting too much from one person.A simple tip, says Leaver, is to ask “better, investigative questions” and actively listen. That is not to say you should go around interrogating people – but showing a genuine interest in a person, asking them about themselves, and listening to their answers can take you a long way towards making more meaningful connections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2372578e937d6d34fe0dcc7a1b7c38454627233f/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcbd9af8f8c9140fcc8adaa6947f3fab 720w","title":"everything you need to know to function as a successful adult","story":"One of the key benefits of age is wisdom.

He did not see any issue with eating the pizza, he said, then added that he didn’t think he had washed his hands in 10 years.“Really,” he said. “I don’t really wash my hands ever.”Met with laughter, he explained: “I inoculate myself.

But what’s going on inside our heads when we fall in love?The American anthropologist Helen Fisher describes the obsessive attachment we experience in love as “someone camping out in your head”.During the early stages of love, the emotional excitement (or some might say stress) raises the body’s cortisol levels, causing a racing heart, butterflies in our stomach and inconveniently sweaty palms. Other chemicals in play are oxytocin, which deepens feelings of attachment, and vasopressin, which has been linked to trust, empathy and sexual monogamy.Actually … in a case of science imitating poetry, the heart has been found to influence the way we experience emotion.Our brain and heart are known to be in close communication. When faced with a threat or when we spot the object of our affection in a crowded room, our heart races. But recently, scientists have turned the tables and shown that feedback from our heart to our brain also influences what we are feeling.One study, led by Prof Sarah Garfinkel of the University of Sussex, showed that cardiovascular arousal – the bit of the heart’s cycle when it is working hardest – can intensify feelings of fear and anxiety. In this study, people were asked to identify scary or neutral images while their heartbeats were tracked. Garfinkel found they reacted quicker to the scary images when their heart was contracting and pumping blood, compared with when it was relaxing. Her work suggests that electrical signals from blood vessels around the heart feed back into brain areas involved in emotional processing, influencing how strongly we think we’re feeling something.Finally, in what must be a contender for one of the most romantic (or mushy) scientific insights to date, couples have been shown to have a tendency to synchronise heartbeats and breathing.Love is merely a madness, Shakespeare wrote. But it is only recently that scientists have offered an explanation for why being in love might inspire unusual behaviour.Donatella Marazziti, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pisa, approached this question after carrying out research showing that people with obsessive compulsive disorder have, on average, lower levels of the brain chemical serotonin in their blood. She wondered whether a similar imbalance could underlie romantic infatuation.She recruited people with OCD, healthy controls and 20 people who had embarked on a romantic relationship within the previous six months (it was also specified that they should not have had sexual intercourse and that at least four hours a day were spent thinking of the partner). Both the OCD group and the volunteers who were in love had significantly lower levels of serotonin, and the authors concluded “that being in love literally induces a state which is not normal”. When the “in love” group were followed up six months later, most of their serotonin levels had returned to normal.A separate study found that people in love have much lower activity in their frontal cortex – an area of the brain crucial to reason and judgment – when they thought of their loved one. Scientists have speculated an evolutionary reason for this which could be termed the “beer goggles” theory: the suspension of reason makes coupling, and hence procreation, far more likely.Sexual orientation has several components, including behaviour, identity, attraction and arousal.As with any scientific investigation, the way questions are framed also makes a difference to the answer. So studies that ask people to pick between two or three categories would miss any more subtle gradations. As Kinsey wrote in 1948: “The living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects. The sooner we learn this concerning human sexual behaviour, the sooner we shall reach a sound understanding of the realities of sex.”It’s worth noting that a 2011 study found no differences between brain systems regulating romantic love in homosexuals and heterosexuals.It has been known for decades that sexual orientation is partly heritable in men, based on studies of identical and fraternal twins. In the 1990s, a specific region of the X chromosome was linked to male homosexuality and more recent two specific genes have been found to be more common in gay men.However, the genetic factors that have been identified so far only play a small part in determining sexuality – not all men who have these genes are gay. Research on the genetic basis of female sexuality lags behind, which some have attributed to it being more difficult to study. Others might conclude that there has simply been less effort to understand this topic.There are other biological factors at play as well. One of the most robust findings in sexual-orientation research is the fraternal-birth-order effect: gay men tend to have a greater number of older brothers compared with straight men. This is a biological influence rather than a social one and is a big effect, increasing the odds of a man being gay by roughly a third. In women, there is evidence that pre-natal hormone exposure can make a difference to sexual orientation.Pheromones are chemical signals that are used to communicate and alter the behaviour of others. The first pheromone discovered, in the 1950s, was a substance called bombykol that female silkworms emit to attract males. Ever since then, the search has been on – not least by perfume manufacturers – to find a human equivalent. There have been some tentative claims.For instance, a known pig pheromone, androstenone, has been found in the human armpit. When female pigs on heat get a whiff of the substance, which is found in boars’ saliva, they adopt the mating stance. However, there is not yet any convincing evidence for real-life “Lynx effect” chemicals in men and women. The strongest contender to date for a human pheromone is a chemical secreted from glands in the nipples of breastfeeding mothers. When wafted under any sleeping baby’s nose, the child responds with sucking and rooting behaviour.Recently scientists have shown that some people may be genetically predisposed to being unfaithful. One study of nearly 7,400 Finnish twins and their siblings found a significant link between the vasopressin gene and infidelity in women.Another study, by scientists at the Kinsey Institute, in Indiana, showed that certain variants of the gene for the dopamine receptor were more likely to be unfaithful and also more likely to be repeatedly unfaithful.Why We Love: the Nature and Chemistry of Romantic Love: Helen FisherSplendors and Miseries of the Brain: Semir ZekiRomeo and Juliet: William Shakespeare"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bceb6220df7c458823d730e8bc053f30c712a541/153_116_3260_1957/master/3260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f143ea26ae410d9f998a06a512d129b6","title":"is the eu ready for a no deal brexit podcast","story":"Unless an agreement can be reached in the coming weeks, Britain will crash out of the European Union without a deal.

They say basic religious freedoms are under threat.The argument over whether schools should teach children about LGBT issues arose in a Birmingham state school last month when 400 predominantly Muslim parents signed a petition calling for the topic to be dropped from the curriculum.In November a Christian parent threatened legal action against her child’s state primary school in south London, claiming it had forced pupils to take part in a “gay pride parade”.Last July the DfE said all state schools would teach children about relationships and health education, including LGBT issues, from September 2020.Its draft guidance to independent schools is non-statutory but Ofsted inspectors and the DfE will take it into account when assessing schools or taking action. The advice is expected to be formally issued later this year.Objections have been raised by independent schools with a conservative religious character and by parents citing religious freedom. The letter supporting the new guidance expresses concern that the DfE plans to water down its advice.Any dilution would pose “a significant safeguarding risk to LGBT young people, who are still subject to significant levels of homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying,” the letter says.“Challenging LGBT discrimination in school lessons and in everyday school life is fundamental to fostering equality at school and in wider society,” it says. “Being LGBT and having a religion are not mutually exclusive. LGBT people are members of all communities, across religions and non-religious worldviews.”Among the signatories are the Rev Jeffrey John, the dean of St Albans Laura Janner-Klausner, senior rabbi to Reform Judaism Fiyaz Mughal, director of Faith Matters Andrew Copson, chief executive of Humanists UK and Kevin Courtney and Mary Bousted, joint general secretaries of the National Education Union.Copson said: “There is widespread support for LGBT inclusion in schools and it is imperative that LGBT lessons in independent schools are not diluted out of fear that it could offend some religious groups.“Providing an inclusive education for all pupils, including LGBT students, so that they can learn and develop in freedom must be the priority for schools and we urge the department against the watering down of its draft proposals.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We want all children to grow up to become happy, healthy and safe, which is why we are making relationships education compulsory for all primary schools as well as relationships and sex education compulsory for all secondary schools.“The draft guidance is clear that teaching should look at healthy relationships and that all pupils learn about equality. The draft guidance is also clear that relationships and sex education should be relevant to all pupils, whatever their developing sexuality or identity, in an age-appropriate way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6294e76a45e8c7eecd84dc45423ef1697afcc921/564_536_2169_1302/master/2169.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb7d3786d75fbe020c783288dace034b","title":"may to ask mps for further fortnights grace in brexit talks","story":"PM will stress her continued focus on Irish backstop but EU indicates it will not give wayTheresa May hopes to convince the House of Commons on Tuesday to give her another fortnight’s grace to keep pushing for changes to the Irish backstop – despite the insistence of Michel Barnier that it is Britain that must compromise.With 45 days to go until Britain is due by law to leave the EU, with or without a deal, the prime minister will address MPs about progress in the Brexit talks, No 10 announced on Monday.She is unlikely to signal any shift towards a closer future relationship with the EU, after writing to Jeremy Corbyn to underline her continued objections to a customs union, and instead she will focus on the backstop.“We are absolutely clear on this: we’re not considering Jeremy Corbyn’s customs proposals, we’re not considering any proposals to remain in the customs union. We must have our own, independent trade policy,” May’s spokesman said on Monday.May will stress her continued focus on the backstop, but the EU’s chief negotiator insisted on Monday there was no question of Brussels giving in to Downing Street’s demands.“We’re waiting for clarity and movement from the United Kingdom,” Barnier told reporters after talks in Luxembourg with the country’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel.At a dinner with Barnier in Brussels later on Monday, the UK’s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had been expected to echo May’s calls for a time limit on the backstop, a unilateral exit mechanism or its replacement with an “alternative arrangement”.But Barnier suggested beforehand that he would offer Barclay little succour. “Tonight I will repeat the EU’s positions. I will listen to what the secretary of state has to tell us concerning the alternative arrangements which the UK would like,” Barnier said. “But it’s not more than a concept today. I will also evaluate the interest from the UK side for possible changes to the political declaration, which, let me remind you, fixes the outline quite precisely for the future separation.”Following the dinner, Barnier said there had been “constructive talks” but reiterated the EU’s refusal to renegotiate the Irish backstop. “It’s clear from our side that we’re not going to reopen the withdrawal agreement but we will continue our discussion in the coming days,” he said.A spokesman for the UK government offered no indication of any progress, adding that the two sides had agreed to further talks and were still seeking to find “a way forward”.A commission official said the two sides had “discussed the urgent need to find a solution that both respects the EU’s guidelines, as well as one that is supported by a strong majority in the House of Commons. Further engagement is foreseen over the next week.”Barclay will travel to Strasbourg on Tuesday to set out the UK’s stance to MEPs, and the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will take the same message to Paris. In Westminster, meanwhile, May is expected to confirm she will hold another Brexit vote in parliament on 27 February.Opponents of a no-deal Brexit inside her cabinet and on the Tory backbenches want to hear confirmation from the prime minister that any motion she tables then will be amendable. That would allow them to have another attempt at winning a majority for an amendment that could force the prime minister’s hand, if she has not brought a reworked version of her deal back to parliament for MPs’ approval before then.Yvette Cooper and Nick Boles, two senior backbenchers whose amendment against no deal failed to gain majority support last month, have not yet made a final decision about whether to table a reworked version or wait until 27 February, the  understands. But they have been working on a revised version of their bill to extend article 50, which would then have to be tabled by mid-March to have a chance of being passed before exit day.Their amendment would set a final mid-March deadline for May to win a majority for her deal, obliging the government to make time for the bill if she has not secured parliament’s support before then.May’s hopes of cobbling together a majority were boosted on Monday as Boris Johnson said he would be willing to accept a deal with a time-limited backstop. The former foreign secretary told a meeting in parliament: “I think it must be pretty obvious that if you are going to have a time limit to the backstop – and I think that would be very good – it has got to fall before the next election.”Some more hardline Brexiters have suggested the backstop must be removed altogether from the withdrawal agreement, but that looks highly unlikely to win favour in Brussels. Downing Street hopes that if May can win round Johnson, she can split the hard-Brexit European Research Group (ERG).Together with a group of Labour backbenchers encouraged by promises of fresh guarantees on workers’ rights and environmental standards, May hopes she can win over enough MPs to pass her deal.Labour will table its own amendment this week seeking to put what the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, calls a “hard stop”, on the government’s negotiating time by enforcing a deadline by which May must bring a deal back to the Commons.May’s insistence that she will not countenance joining a customs union was seized on by those MPs who want to see Labour embrace a “people’s vote”. They suggested it was now time for Corbyn to do so.It emerged on Monday that an earlier draft of Corbyn’s letter to the prime minister last week, which was initially drawn up by Starmer, included a reference to a referendum, but it was removed during the editing process.Asked about the claim by journalists in Dublin on Monday, Starmer said: “The letter was an agreed letter that went out. We’ve now got a response from the prime minister. The critical question is: is she, in her response, indicating a willingness to drop her red lines or not?”In her letter to Corbyn, May argued that her own Brexit plan “explicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union” in terms of avoiding tariffs, while allowing “development of the UK’s independent trade policy beyond our economic partnership with the EU”.She wrote: “I am not clear why you believe it would be preferable to seek a say in future EU trade deals rather than the ability to strike our own deals.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1d465f10ea186534254013243b55206c28b25d4/190_138_3171_1902/master/3171.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1c43d104e55447f19b7a4ba4a3281b2","title":"hammonds brexit dividend claim rejected as uk economy stalls","story":"Chancellor’s claim undermined as rapid slowdown in GDP growth is revealedPhilip Hammond’s claim that Britain can reap an economic idend from Theresa May’s Brexit deal has been flatly rejected by MPs, as official figures confirmed the UK has suffered its worst year for GDP growth since 2012.In a highly critical report, the Treasury select committee warned that the chancellor’s claims of a “deal idend” if Britain avoided a no-deal exit lacked credibility.Nicky Morgan MP, the Conservative chair of the committee, said Hammond’s “idend” claim, at the Conservative party conference last year, had already been undermined by the government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. The OBR had told the committee the idend was not an economic boost so much as “avoiding something really very bad” in the form of a no-deal departure.“The OBR already assumes an orderly Brexit, so there won’t be a ‘deal idend’ beyond the forecast just by avoiding no-deal. Business confidence may improve with increased certainty, but it’s not credible to describe this as a idend,” said Morgan.The OBR has made a smooth departure from the EU a key part of its forecasts, which prompted the Treasury committee to state there is no evidence of an economic boost from supporting the deal over and above those central estimates.Hammond has repeatedly suggested that, should parliament throw its weight behind Theresa May’s Brexit plan, it would generate a dual economic boost for the country by lifting the fog of uncertainty blocking businesses investment, while also allowing him to spend public funds held in reserve for a no-deal scenario. Reacting to Morgan’s comments, Treasury insiders dismissed the suggestion that Britain would not see a deal idend from MPs supporting the prime minister’s Brexit plan, as it would give firms more clarity about the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU.“The chancellor has been clear that when we agree a good deal we will harvest a deal idend. This is because businesses will have the certainty they need to invest, grow and create jobs which will improve the public finances,” the source said.Most economists believe that Britain agreeing a Brexit deal with Brussels would help to give firms clarity for the future, potentially unleashing projects that have been put on hold due to the uncertainty.Amit Kara, the head of UK macroeconomics research at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: “It could be a idend as all we’re saying is we’re moving from an acute phase of uncertainty to remaining within the EU for at least the next two years.”He added: “The idend is just because of the mess at the moment.”The committee’s intervention undermines one of Theresa May’s key arguments to persuade MPs to back her withdrawal agreement with less than 50 days to go before Brexit. It also comes as the British economy shows increasing signs of stress as the deadline for the article 50 process looms ever closer, causing more business to put their plans to invest in Britain on hold.Companies have intensified their contingency planning to cope with the possibility of a disruptive Brexit. Car manufacturers are stockpiling parts, banks have moved employees to Ireland and continental Europe and two Japanese electronics firms, Panasonic and Sony, have moved their EU headquarters to mainland Europe.Labour and trade unions called on the prime minister to remove no-deal Brexit as an option in order to shore up confidence in Britain, something which May has so far refused to do in negotiations with Brussels.Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “The prime minister’s failure to rule out a no-deal Brexit is harming confidence in the economy and holding back growth. With our manufacturing sector in recession, the prime minister must act now to remove the threat of crashing out.”GDP growth in December plunged into reverse, with a broad-based slump across each of the key sectors for the economy. The manufacturing sector, which makes up about a tenth of the economy, fell into recession, with six months of negative growth in the longest negative run since September 2008 to February 2009, the depths of the financial crisis.While the slowdown mirrors a loss of momentum in the world economy, including a deterioration in the eurozone, most analysts believe that unique challenges from Brexit have further hindered UK growth.Ben Brettell, a senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “There’s little doubt Brexit uncertainty is responsible for the disappointing numbers, though concerns over global trade will also have played a part.”The committee also warned that Hammond’s deficit reduction target – to eliminate the gap between government spending and income by the early part of the next decade – now lacked credibility. Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal is expected to come with significant negative consequences for the public finances, with potential for the deficit to widen.Hammond opted at the last budget to raise public spending, with a £20bn a year increase for the NHS by 2023-24, without making significant tax increases to balance the books.Referring to that decision, the committee said: “The government’s fiscal objective has no credibility and should be replaced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b213caf2b8cab0720bb48bb71c8465941e8bf48f/117_0_1246_747/master/1246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f41049b854e014ec174e4b99b26972e5","title":"did you solve it on the tiles with the new escher","story":"The solutions to today’s puzzlesEarlier today I set you the following puzzles.

It also pushes back the earliest evidence of self-propelled movement of eukaryotes by 1.5bn years – scooping the title from far younger multicellular lifeforms – and would be the first clear signs of motility for any type of organism.“The question is: is this the first evidence of locomotion in some sort of complex living organism, and if it is, why is it that it took about 1,500m years before we start to see similar things in abundance in the geological record?” said Dr Ernest Chi Fru from Cardiff University, the co-author of the research. “Was it an experiment in locomotion that failed?”Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the international team of researchers reveal how they used imaging techniques to probe what they describe as “string-shaped structures” found in a deposit of black shale – sedimentary rock that formed from a muddy marine bed.Found in Gabon, Africa, in what is called the Francevillian Formation, and dated at about 2.1bn years old, the rocks have previously – and controversially – been reported to contain the earliest signs of multicellular life.Now researchers say the rocks also contain the earliest evidence of locomotion: a host of structures of up to 6mm across and up to 170mm in length, some of which are intertwined, with rounded ends. While some run horizontally through the rock, others bend upwards.Experts say the structures are probably the fossilised mucus trails of early multicellular organisms that travelled through sediment: many of the structures were found to be formed of pyrite (iron disulphide), probably produced as a result of activity by microbes that fed on the mucus.The team say they considered, but ruled out, the possibility that the structures could have been formed by natural geological processes rather than living organisms, saying that the shape and texture of the structures, as well as chemical analysis of the pyrite points to a biological origin.They add that while some might suggest the structures were formed by waves shifting microbial biofilms around, further inspection rules out such an explanation.“What we see here does not conform to that sort of pattern,” said Chi Fru, adding: “The consistency of these twists and turns and the size of the burrows, it is very, very, very distinct and looks like what you would see for something living, not non-biological.”The authors say the complexity of the movement shown by trails, and their dimensions, suggest they were made by a eukaryote, They add that it might have been similar, at least in behaviour, to slime moulds, which exist as inidual amoebae but team up when food supplies dwindle to form a multicellular system that can travel. The team note that the newly revealed structures were often found close to the fossilised remains of microbial mats.The researchers believe that “the microbial mats served as grazing grounds for this thing that was moving”, said Chi Fru.While oxygen levels in the Earth’s atmosphere rose steeply several hundred million years ago – a change that has been linked to the emergence of complex life 540m years ago – there was a smaller spike in oxygen levels far earlier, during an interval known as the Lomagundi event. That, the researchers say, coincides with the dating of the Gabon fossils.Dr Dominic Papineau, an expert in geochemistry and early fossils from University College London who was not involved in the study, said the findings were consistent with the structures being fossils. However, he said there was no signs that the organisms had tiny hairs or tail-like structures – signs of which do not preserve well in pyrite, he said – so it is not clear how the organisms moved. “If they are correct, then their discovery challenges a few aspects of what we thought we knew about biological evolution,”said Papineau, although he added that it would tie in with the ancient spike in atmospheric oxygen, highlighting the importance of the gas. However, Prof Graham Shields of University College London urged caution, noting that the structures might just be ripped-up or dried-out fragments of microbial mats or tube-like organisms called Grypania.“I think the case for some biological connection is strong,” he said, adding the pyrite was probably produced through the activity of bacteria that use sulphur as fuel. “However, I don’t see much evidence for motility, ie wilful movement through a sediment in search of food, other than superficial resemblance to trails or burrows.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a88b8ebbda110a177ab16b7dc79ae016b66e71a/20_0_2961_1776/master/2961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b61ee52e02a2a6b2157498a170690a6","title":"american teenage e cigarette use cdc study","story":"Vaping among young people increased by 1.5 million in 2018, prompting calls for regulation Roughly 4.9 million American teens used e-cigarettes in 2018, an increase of 1.5 million teens in just 12 months, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday.The new figures prompted the head of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates tobacco, to propose updating regulations of vaping products, such as Juul. Health officials said no other category of tobacco use changed among America’s high school and middle school students.“These data are a sobering reminder of the rampant rise of youth e-cigarette use,” said the FDA commissioner, Dr Scott Gottlieb. “I fear this trend will continue in 2019, forcing us to make some tough decisions about the regulatory status of e-cigarettes.”“No child should be using any tobacco or nicotine-containing product and we’re committed to reversing this epidemic,” Gottlieb said. The FDA is currently being sued by a group of health campaigners for delaying e-cigarette regulations meant to go into effect early in the Trump presidency. Following the release of new data on Monday, groups again called for the FDA to take “critical actions”, including stopping sales of all flavored tobacco.“The skyrocketing growth of young people’s e-cigarette use over the past year threatens to erase progress made in reducing youth tobacco use,” said Dr Robert Redfield, director of the CDC. “It’s putting a new generation at risk for nicotine addiction.”Last week, a group of 16 free-market thinktanks, at least 11 of which accepted tobacco industry donations, wrote to the FDA to urge the agency against regulation of e-cigarettes. The groups said further regulation of e-cigarettes, fueled by “panic” over teen use, would cost the US jobs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8f6ac5e1b1e00bdb6fa13170bbc01385acb5f28/338_79_2699_1619/master/2699.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98bb665dd14503ad1e35a1fb8bbf9122","title":"universal credit rollout linked to rising food bank use amber rudd admits","story":"Work and pensions secretary says benefit payment delays could have led to increaseAmber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, has conceded that the rollout of universal credit has contributed to an increase in food bank use, going back on previous ministerial claims that this was not the case.Answering a ministerial question in the Commons about food insecurity and universal credit, the controversial all-in-one working age benefits system that replaces a series of inidual payments, Rudd said the system had been improved.“We are committed to a strong safety net where people need it,” Rudd said in response to a question from Labour’s Sharon Hodgson. “It is absolutely clear that there were challenges with the initial rollout of universal credit, and the main issue that led to an increase in food bank use could have been the fact that people had difficulty accessing their money early enough.”Rudd added: “We have made changes to accessing universal credit so that people can have advances, so that there is a legacy run-on after two weeks of housing benefit, and we believe that that will help with food and security.”Following up her question, Hodgson said she had interviewed people for an ongoing inquiry into food insecurity, and that the overall reasons were complex. She added: “But they are telling me that universal credit is making their situation worse, not better.”Rudd, the former home secretary who has pledged a more humane approach to the benefits system since taking the work and pensions job in November, said: “I believe and hope that the changes we have made in terms of accessing early funds will have reduced insecurity, but of course I will take an early interest in the report that she is producing.”Universal credit has faced persistent criticism that its complexity and, in particular, delays to initial payments, have caused many people making new claims or moving from other benefits to go into debt, with some needing to use food banks.When he was a junior work and pensions minister, Damian Hinds, now the education secretary, said he did not expect the further rollout of universal credit to mean more people having to use food banks.In October, another junior minister in the department, Alok Sharma, rejected the findings of a report that said the shift to universal credit had caused many more people to use food banks, saying there were “very many reasons” why people used them.Ministers have sought to address the hardship caused by delays to initial payments by changing time limits and making it easier for claimants to receive an immediate sum as a loan.Since taking over at the department, Rudd has paused the planned mass “migration” of existing benefit claimants to universal credit pending another trial and introduced changes such as making payments directly to women if they are the household’s main carer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e6125dd9f980462f02567fe506fbee1a17781e0/40_154_4352_2611/master/4352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7086e34956c8378028edc194956f72d","title":"british horse racing resumes wednesday equine influenza","story":"Racing’s flu-related nightmare appears to be almost over, following the news on Monday night that the sport will be allowed to resume on Wednesday, when the four scheduled race meetings will take place under enhanced biosecurity measures. In a surprisingly detailed statement the British Horseracing Authority also announced the rescheduling of several important jumps races lost last weekend, including the Betfair Hurdle and the Denman Chase.Those two races, wiped out along with the rest of a valuable card at Newbury, will now be run at Ascot on Saturday. “It’s very good news for all,” said the leading jumps trainer Paul Nicholls, who confirmed he plans to run Clan Des Obeaux in the Denman as a final prep run for the Cheltenham Gold Cup next month. Warwick’s Kingmaker Chase will be salvaged and form part of Sandown’s Friday card.The BHA had taken a cautious approach to the revelation last Wednesday that equine influenza had infected vaccinated racehorses at the Cheshire stable of Donald McCain, moving swiftly to suspend racing to assess the extent of the problem and reduce the risk of it spreading rapidly.When more cases were found on Sunday night in the Newmarket stable of Simon Crisford, there were fears that officials might persist with a conservative approach and delay a resumption for another week.But the BHA’s team of veterinary advisers were unanimous in concluding that the sport could now open its doors, subject to certain risk management.Brant Dunshea, the BHA’s chief regulatory officer, said: “After analysis of thousands of samples, and no further positive tests on Monday, we still have only two confirmed sites of infection. We have put robust containment measures in place around both. From the testing and analysis conducted the disease appears to be contained at present.”However, there could be a sting in the tail for some trainers, as not all stables will be allowed to send runners to the track immediately. The BHA said it was categorising stables according to the risk of infection to which they had been exposed and hoped to have the list finalised by this morning. “The ability of runners to return to racing from those yards will depend on the risk categories the yards are placed in,” the statement said.For the time being the BHA will allow entries from only horses that have received a flu vaccination within the past six months. This could also be a stumbling block for some trainers, who have a policy of doing their vaccinations once a year in the summer. The trainer Brendan Powell tweeted: “Vets going to be extremely busy tomorrow with trainers wanting flu vacs done!”David Sykes, the BHA’s director of equine welfare, promised increased scrutiny at tracks. “We will observe closely those horses who are taken to the racecourse,” he said, “and will intervene as a precaution to prevent a horse running or accessing a racecourse if we believe it might put other horses at risk of infection.“The veterinary committee are of the view that an unprecedented amount of this disease has been identified in Europe. This is not a typical endemic period and it was essential that precautions be taken to protect the horse population.”Another avenue for British trainers opened up on Monday when the Irish regulator lifted its ban on British-based runners, “provided that the horses comply with the IHRB requirements”. Irish racing introduced a new rule on Friday requiring all runners to have had a vaccine for the particular strain of flu now in circulation and insisting that they must have done so within the previous eight weeks as a condition of being allowed to race.

England have been extremely well coached in both matches so far and so George North’s first try for Wales against France on the opening night will not have gone unnoticed by Eddie Jones and his assistants. They will have seen that Hadleigh Parkes’s kick forward found space, it put Yoann Huget in a position he did not want to be in and then a bit of pressure from North brought the mistake. England took that and seized on it.To be brutally honest, Sunday was as bad as the French can play – there was no structure and very limited awareness of what they were trying to do but again England stuck to their game plan and took their opportunities. France’s biggest problem was having Morgan Parra and Louis Picamoles stuck in the back field. Parra is a world-class player but England targeted him and France just could not react.A lot of teams leave their No 9 in the back field – Saracens are one example – and often if he is kicking from the back of a ruck or maul, the 9 will stay after the kick chase and the No 8 will often stay if the maul has gone to ground or he is the last man up from an exit ruck. But these guys have got to be practising fielding high balls and Parra and Picamoles looked completely exposed.Huget dropped the first one in the first minute but one would have expected to see him back there fielding most of the kicks. From that first minute onwards one knew what was coming – Owen Farrell, Elliot Daly and Henry Slade kept on poking the ball in behind, trying to keep it in play but it really was not a problem if it went out because the France lineout was malfunctioning as well. If your lineout is not going well and you are not dealing with kicks in the back fieldWith that combination, there is no relief from pressure and you are in for a long day at the office.England spotted it and took advantage but I am sure it was part of the plan coming into the match. It strikes me their open-field kicking percentage has gone up significantly in the last two matches – 47 open-field kicks is a lot – and what I am seeing is a lot of kicks on kicks. If Ben Youngs is sending up a box-kick and England are winning it back they are identifying quickly the picture of who is in the back field – a lot of the time against France it was no one – and finding the space. Youngs kicks again immediately. A lot of teams sometimes fall into the trap of box-kicking, getting the ball back and trying to play but it is a very good time to kick again. The defence is not set, they are anticipating getting the ball so get into an attacking shape and all of a sudden no one is reacting.Youngs did that brilliantly, Farrell as well, and England are benefiting from having two very capable left-footed kickers behind him in Slade and Daly. As soon as Farrell makes the pass England have moved the point of attack. That five- or 10-metre pass means the defending team has to get up because England’s wings come into play. England’s ability to put another pass in and kick from the edge then brings the defensive full-back up and if the opposing wings switch off it creates space in the back field.The questions now are how do Wales counter that and will England change their game plan in Cardiff? Firstly, Wales have to disrupt England’s rhythm. They must pressure England’s kickers and make sure Youngs is at the bottom of a ruck so he is not able to kick. If Wales kick to England, they should mix it up and make it as unpredictable as possible. Or keep the ball in hand.England will have a similar focus to the first two weeks and will try to put pressure on the back three. A lot will depend on whether Liam Williams is at full-back or if Leigh Halfpenny returns. If it is Williams I would expect England to keep the ball away from him, George North can be turned and targeted aerially, as can Josh Adams, so they will go after the wings. If it is Halfpenny, I expect a lot more contestable kicks because he is not the biggest but is so good positionally there will simply not be the same amount of space.But more important for England will be the power game. There has not been a lot of play from deep, not a great deal of in-phase play, so they will look to win the territorial battle and use the power of Manu Tuilagi and the Vunipolas, should Mako be fit, in the right areas of the field. England will go to Cardiff with the belief that their forwards will win the battle against the Wales pack.England would not be kicking as much against the southern hemisphere teams because Australia and New Zealand have a greater ability to play more from deep. England want to win the Six Nations, though, and they are employing the right tactics to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps. We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

She has been working for two weeks straight, with no break at the weekend, and she has six-year-old twins, a boy and a girl. “So I’m a wee bit tired. But good, really good,” she says. She is dipping into her free time to talk about her new TV series, Flack, because she is not only starring in it, but executive-producing it, too, and it is co-produced through her own company, Casm. She has spent five years trying to get it off the ground, in stops and starts, and they finished filming it just four days before we meet. Hence the tiredness? She nods. “It’s not a name-only credit. I’m a huge control freak. I’m involved in every single aspect of every single decision.”In person, Paquin is brisk, earnest and articulate, and careful with her words. She was born in Canada in 1982, but grew up in New Zealand, then moved to the US as a teenager for work. She has been in front of the camera since she was nine, when she was cast in Jane Campion’s film The Piano. “I entered this industry in a very backwards sort of way,” she says. “I did one job, won an Oscar, and then people said: ‘Ooh, you have a career now.’” She points out, though, that there is a wealth of talented women in her age group, which means she will “still have to audition my arse off for stuff I really want”, but it does mean that she can generally work on things that she wants to. “I do have the luxury of being a little more choosy because of the circumstances of my career.”In Flack, Paquin is Robyn, a hard-living, self-destructive type who works in the crisis-management area of public relations. The show is a lot of fun, and reminds me what good TV was like before shows developed grand cinematic ambitions. It’s outrageous, a little bit camp and darkly comic in tone. “Oh, it goes places, and it keeps going places,” Paquin says with a smile, admitting that it speaks to her sense of humour. In the first episode, Robyn has to cover up a philandering TV chef and a footballer’s drug-fuelled gay tryst, all the while juggling her own issues, which seem to involve a lot of cocaine. “Some people will be offended, other people will be laughing so hard they’re going to snort coffee through their nose while they’re watching it.” That’s a state of affairs that suits her. “I want people to absolutely love it, or, possibly, be violently like: ‘How could you?’” Would she take that as a compliment? “Oh, yeah. It means that we did it properly.”Oliver Lansley, who wrote and created Flack, told Deadline Hollywood that with Robyn, he wanted to create a female character who could stand alongside “difficult men” such as Tony Soprano, Mad Men’s Don Draper and Breaking Bad’s Walter White. Paquin feels passionately that stories about “complicated women” should be told. “I mean, take Dexter. Male protagonists get to quite literally be serial killers and the audience still loves them. Whereas traditionally, if female characters put one foot out of line, from the sort of patriarchal ideals of what a perfect woman is like, then you have to watch them being punished for it. And I really am enjoying the fact that I’m part of a generation of women in film where we can just tell interesting, complicated stories about people who happen to be women.”What’s changed? “The power balance has changed,” she says. “There are more women in executive and behind-the-scenes roles who have just had enough of being told what we can and can’t do. And women like myself going: ‘OK, I’ve been doing this for 27 years I’m not going to sit around and wait for those roles to show up. I’m going to go out there, find it, create it and make it happen for myself.’”There is a reason, she suggests, that it takes more time for women to step into positions of power. “One has to work extra-hard as a woman in a very male-dominated industry. As an actress walking on to a film set, you’re guilty until proven innocent. They assume you’re going to be a pain in the arse, high-maintenance and difficult, and you usually spend the first couple of weeks having to work hard to prove that you’re not going to be a problem because you’re a woman. And I think we’re all just collectively done with that.”I ask her about her experiences of being an adolescent in a business like this, and she takes a deep breath. “You’d need a year to really get into the broad strokes of that one. Look, I’ve had some really amazing experiences, and I’ve had some absolutely horrific experiences. People treat people who have no power, sometimes, in ways that are completely unacceptable. But when you’re a child and you don’t know any different, and you don’t want to get into trouble, you just keep your mouth shut.”She is cautiously optimistic that, in these more open times, sets are being made safer, and women might be able to make it a better industry. “When I see younger girls on set, or kids, that I once looked at thinking: ‘Please, dear God, get out of the film industry,’ I now think: ‘Actually, we might be able to make this a safe environment for young people in positions of no power.’”Paquin almost gave up acting in her late teens. She enrolled at Columbia University, planning to study French and English literature. Her mother is an English teacher, so she thought she might follow in her footsteps, or perhaps write. But theatre reignited her enthusiasm, and she went on to appear in a series of blockbusters, including a stint as Rogue in the X-Men film franchise. In 2008, she took her first TV role, as Sookie Stackhouse in the supernatural series True Blood, and it was a huge hit.In 2014, while promoting the show, she sat down with the talkshow host Larry King, who asked her a series of what she found to be intrusive questions about its sex scenes. “I’m not saying that the generation thing is an excuse … but I do legitimately think he is of a generation where certain kinds of entertainment didn’t exist, probably, when he was growing up,” she says. Would that line of questioning happen now, even five years later? “I do think in general people are a little bit more careful about how they ask women questions about anything to do with sex, sexuality and provocative content. As they should be.”She adds that he got more stick for asking her about being bisexual, and whether she was a “former bisexual” because she had married Stephen Moyer, her True Blood co-star. “He got the shit kicked out of him by the LGBT community.” Paquin, who came out as bisexual in 2010, says that misunderstandings are fairly common. “People understand the version of the world they live in, and if it’s outside their experience, then sometimes it frightens people, or they just don’t get it. And that’s fine.” She has worked with LGBT advocacy charities for years, and her Twitter and Instagram feeds suggest she’s more than happy to get into discussions with people who disagree with her. “I don’t want to hit somebody over the head with something and go: ‘You’re stupid.’ I want to explain things to people,” she says.With Flack, there is a sense that Paquin is pulling back the curtain on showbiz. It is heightened, of course, but nevertheless it speaks of the uneasy relationship between the illusion of fame and the reality of it. “When you have a job that involves being everything to everybody at all times, being a chameleon, what does that do to your sense of your real self? How do you maintain a grasp on reality when your job is constantly playing with reality?” she asks. She’s talking about her character, but I tell her that it sounds like a good question for an actor, too. “Yes,” she laughs, quietly. “You could say that.”Flack starts on Thursday 21 February at 10pm on W."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e97747287544f9938dfaee40ba9fc860e169a22/0_103_2052_1231/master/2052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61b1e1f4a252831a3f324012fdf70813","title":"bbc to bring back crackerjack sam and mark cbbc iplayer","story":"Bid to get children to watch more TV also includes revival of The Demon HeadmasterThe BBC is to revive the children’s TV show Crackerjack, 35 years after it was last aired.The broadcaster announced that the programme, which originally ran from 1955 until 1984, will be made at MediaCityUK, in Salford, by BBC Children’s in-house production team. It will air next year on CBBC and iPlayer.The programme was introduced every week with the phrase: “It’s Friday, it’s five to five … It’s Crackerjack!” It was originally filmed in front of an audience of children in London, and included teams of children competing in games, as well as comedy and music acts.The BBC said the show would be updated for “today’s connected generation giving them an all-round, interactive experience while retaining the beating heart of what etched Crackerjack into the affections of British children for three decades.” There will be 10 episodes in the series.The programme will include a return of the Double or Drop game, in which children are chosen from the audience to answer questions, winning prizes for correct answers and cabbages for incorrect ones. Contestants have to hold their prizes for the duration of the competition without dropping them. As in the original show, Crackerjack pencils will be awarded to contestants.This series will be presented by the children’s TV presenters Sam Nixon and Mark Rhodes, who will follow in the footsteps of Eamonn Andrews (who later presented This Is Your Life), Leslie Crowther, Michael Aspel, Ed Stewart and Stu Francis.Cheryl Taylor, the head of content for BBC Children’s, said: “Crackerjack is just one of several fabulous series that Children’s in-house productions have developed this year. It’s the perfect vehicle for our much-loved stars Sam and Mark and promises to usher in a new era of frenetic family fun and whizzbang audience antics.”The production team has also announced other new commissions, including a revival of the 1990s children’s drama The Demon Headmaster and the mystery drama Get Even, about four teenage girls who expose injustice.The Demon Headmaster is to be remade with a “super head” of an academy school as the villain. The show, which is based on the children’s books by Gillian Cross, follows a group of children who realise their headmaster is using hypnotism to gain complete control of their school.Greg Childs, director of the Children’s Media Foundation, said reviving Crackerjack was a good way of appealing to parents, but added: “We wonder whether it will be as attractive to children, especially those who have migrated in great numbers to watching content on their personal devices, and mainly short-form content on YouTube. It will be interesting to see if the digital plans behind Crackerjack will help solve that problem.”He welcomed the news that the BBC was investing in live action content for older children by commissioning Get Even. “We have been calling for additional content for the upper end of children’s programming (12- to 15-year-olds) for some time now, as this age group is currently underserved by the public service broadcasters,” he said.In December 2017 the government launched a £60m fund to help make children’s television programmes in Britain, in reaction to a sharp increase in children watching foreign-made programmes on Netflix and YouTube.The media regulator Ofcom has previously called on British broadcasters to produce more original programming for young people, and last month it published research showing that UK children aged five to 15 spent more time online than they did watching TV in a typical day.While they found children’s online time stopped increasing for the first time in 2018, averaging at two hours and 11 minutes per day, the amount of time they spent watching TV every day fell again, by eight minutes, to an hour and 52 minutes.Research published in October last year found that 16- to 34-year-olds spent about an hour and 20 minutes a day consuming BBC content, around half of the average amount of time across all age groups. It found one in eight young people did not watch or listen to any BBC programmes at all in a given week.“The decline in use among young people is a concern, not only because this audience group is less well served but because young people are critical for the future relevance and success of the BBC,” said Ofcom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c541f68bfad3272316acafd63bf3182d6be1694/0_431_4039_2425/master/4039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5188a05823c415bf47aac32ca8461bc","title":"patronising and totally false my despair at tv about gypsies a very british history bbc","story":"After a decade of watching shows that are part Stars in Their Eyes, part nature programme, I’ve tried to make one that gets at the truth about Gypsy life and history Over the past decade, Gypsy documentaries have been doing something insidious. Armed with patronising, misleading voiceovers delivered in cut-glass English accents – “Tonight, we reveal what it’s really like to be a Traveller woman!” … “From as soon as she’s old enough to walk, every Traveller girl dreams of her wedding day!” – it’s a narrative that’s part Stars in Their Eyes, part nature show. These programmes conjure the feeling that you’re getting an intricate and balanced depiction of a hidden world. In fact, the reverse is true on all counts. Poorly researched and stripped of context, they can create the impression that social problems spring up out of nowhere that Gypsies and Travellers are magically immune to common human concerns about work, money, health and their children’s education that everyone from a certain background, or a certain gender, is the same.You’d be forgiven for not knowing much about Gypsy history. Not just because Romany Gypsies are a small minority in modern Britain, but because most books, films and TV shows that feature them make no mention of history. In fiction and in drama, Gypsies tend to be used as a simple plot device: a mysterious world for a protagonist to escape to, or a red herring in a murder mystery. In other words, a grab-bag of weirdness and weirdos. Ahistorical and disconnected, they camp on the fringes of storylines, with whatever clothes, accents or nonsensical talents the production feels like giving them.With the opener of A Very British History, we’ve tried to make a film that’s different in several significant ways. It harks back to the 1960s – a time of great change for Romany people, due to restrictive new laws on caravans, fewer halting sites and less work in their traditional agricultural trades – and uses footage from that time, much of which has never been seen before. We witness brutal evictions being resisted with ever more extreme tactics: one Bromley councillor, wide-eyed with alarm, warns that local people go about “in fear of molestation” when Gypsies are around. Though many hotels and inns at the time displayed signs saying “NO GYPSIES”, here we see that one Kent pub went further, actually painting the words right by its doors. Incredibly, that same pub later played host to the first ever meeting of the Gypsy Council.There are smiles as well as politics and tears. Film of the fast-paced horse trotting at Cumbria’s Appleby Fair, then and now, shows that much has remained the same at this rambunctious rural event. We see men with swept-back hair haggling over a scrap metal deal in the middle of an orchard. One of them, Jim Riley, spins out his life philosophy from the wheel of his Bedford truck: “I like to be free. I like to be my own boss. Do what I like, go where I like, come back when I like. You know, so long as I just get a bit of a living I’m quite happy. I ain’t a rich bloke and never will be.”Making this film was only possible because the 1960s was a “golden age” of broadcasting about Gypsies. Social documentarians such as Philip Donnellan, Ewan MacColl, Peggy Seeger and Charles Parker were hard at work. They interviewed with respect, crafting subtle and sympathetic narratives a world away from the oversimplifications of recent documentaries. They also let people’s actual voices be heard. It seems unbelievable now, but before this time, actors would be hired to re-record comments given by Gypsies and other people whose accents were deemed too coarse to broadcast. These programmes balanced the hard facts of Traveller life and community tensions with an appreciation of the history that led up to them. There was a tangible hinterland which had led Gypsy life to be both romanticised and demonised. They recorded tales of faerie folk, told by Scottish Traveller matriarchs in mediaeval “bender” tents in Highland glens captured songs in the Romani language and they recorded a Birmingham Labour councillor saying that Gypsies who refused to fit in should be “exterminated”.This episode of A Very British History points out historical ironies, like Romany tradesmen building houses on the very spot where their families used to stop in horse-drawn wagons. There are interviews with people too scared to live near Gypsies, and with Gypsies forced to live in a line of trailers that stretched for miles down one of the country’s busiest trunk roads. We even hear from the son of the prolific novelist Barbara Cartland, who recalls how his mother fought to set up a caravan site for Romany families near her glamorous home in the Hertfordshire countryside. And we meet a silver horse called Fifty Shades of Grey.• A Very British History starts on Monday at 9pm on BBC Four."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e13a8049072619267dd886a3c7916eb49ebdc6a/0_31_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04d3abcaf1a25c635a7e13c01e56a97c","title":"mike pompeo to meet viktor orban on tour of central europe","story":"US secretary of state will dine with Hungarian leader before travelling to other countries The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has embarked on a tour of central European countries aimed at countering the influence of Russia and China, after a decade in which the region has been sidelined by US diplomacy.“When we’re not here others will show up,” said Pompeo at a joint press conference with the Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, on Monday afternoon in Budapest.Pompeo was due to dine with Viktor Orbán, the country’s rightwing prime minister, who was shunned under Barack Obama’s administration for his populist style and moves against media freedoms and the rule of law.The Trump administration has taken a new approach, prioritising engagement over criticism. Orbán’s actions and words on migration, speaking of a threat to “Christian culture” and building a fence along the country’s border, are similar to much of Donald Trump’s rhetoric, and state department officials have also said engagement is necessary to counter the growing influence of Russia and China in the region.Despite Hungary’s status as an EU and Nato member, Orbán has struck up warm relations with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, leading many to fear that Russia could be using Budapest as a base for spying and other influence operations in Europe. While Trump has frequently praised Putin, the state department has made it clear that countering Moscow’s influence in Europe remains a priority.“Hungarians know well from their history that an authoritarian Russia will never be a friend to the freedom and sovereignty of smaller nations,” said Pompeo.Trump’s friend David Cornstein, an 80-year-old former jewellery magnate, was appointed ambassador to Hungary last year. He has been tasked with building a new relationship with Orbán. Cornstein has said he will not publicly criticise Orbán.Despite this, Cornstein’s requests to the Hungarian government to keep open the Central European University, an English-language institution founded by George Soros that has come under fire from Orbán, were ignored. The university is gradually moving to Vienna after being refused accreditation by Hungarian authorities. This has led some to question whether engagement was the right approach.A leaked Hungarian diplomatic cable from December, published by the investigative website direkt36, suggested there was frustration in Washington over Hungarian intransigence on several issues considered as key to US interests.During his visit, Pompeo made progress on the signing of a new defence cooperation agreement between the US and Hungary, which has long been stalled.Despite the focus on engagement, Pompeo also met civil society groups in Budapest, including those targeted by the Hungarian government for providing legal assistance to refugees attempting to enter the country. The government has smeared many such groups as “Soros agents”, which are working to destroy Hungary.On Tuesday, Pompeo will travel to Bratislava, where he will meet Slovakia’s leaders, before visiting Warsaw for a US-sponsored conference on the Middle East. The conference, which has been received warily by the EU, is expected to focus on Iran. Pompeo will briefly visit Brussels and Iceland before returning home.Pompeo also delivered a message about the dangers of Chinese influence in the region, after a Huawei employee was arrested for spying by Polish authorities last month. The telecommunications company operates across the region.Pompeo said each nation could make its own decisions but suggested US cooperation could be downgraded in nations that chose to maintain a strong Huawei presence.“If that equipment is co-located where we have important American systems, it makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them. We want to make sure we identify the opportunities and the risks with using that equipment.

Photograph: Alan BetsonAn eleventh-hour agreement was reached between the Government and nurses on Monday night to avert a three-day strike due to begin on Tuesday morning which would have thrown the health system into chaos.But the proposed agreement, brokered by the Labour Court and which must be voted on by 40,000 nurses, came at the price of pay increases for nurses that could threaten the wider public sector pay agreement.Ministers insisted that the proposed agreement, which is likely to be approved by Cabinet on Tuesday morning, did not contravene the terms of the existing public sector deal.However, senior Government sources acknowledged that the special deal for nurses would likely see pay pressures, already simmering in several areas of the public service, increase.If the deal is approved some 26,000 nurses and midwives will receive €1,200 on average in additional payments.The agreement would see a new grade which many nurses can transfer to for higher salaries, and while some nurses would see a salary rise of almost €2,500, or more than 7 per cent, this includes pay increases already due.Overall the proposed deal would be worth an average 2.5 per cent for nurses and midwives, with bigger increases among younger and newly-qualified nurses.The agreement also sets out a series of productivity requirements and other workplace reforms.Two-tier pay systemThe proposed deal will cost €10million to €20 million to implement this year after changes to a previously-announced Government initiative to tackle the two-tier pay system for nurses recruited in recent years are taken into account, The  understands.The Government is also hoping that the productivity measures and a reduction in the €114 million a year bill for staff provided by employment agencies will generate further savings.While Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe refused to ulge details of the expected total cost of the nurses’ package before he briefs the Cabinet on Tuesday morning, The  understands the proposals could cost between €25 million to €35 million in 2020. The total public sector pay bill is €19 billion.The proposals allow the Government to revisit the pay increases if the projected savings do not materialise.On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) and the Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) suspended their plans for further strikes.While the proposed agreement is nowhere near the 12 per cent sought by nurses, there are fears in Government that other public sector unions will follow the nurses’ example.ImplicationsOn Monday night Mr Donohoe insisted that the agreement did not breach the public sector pay agreement, but the largest public sector union Fórsa said it would study the recommendation to see what implications it had for other unions.The news came as patients were bracing themselves for three days of disruption to hospital services which Government feared would have thrown the health service into chaos.Although many appointments have already been cancelled for Tuesday, Minister for Health Simon Harris pledged that the health service would do all it could to “catch up on what has been the lost time of the last number of days”.He said it was “welcome news for patients across the country”, but added that he believed it was also “welcome news for nurses and midwives, who did not take the decision to strike lightly”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3790346.1549920326!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nurse proposal places big questions over public sector pay accord","story":"February 9th, 2019: Tens of thousands of people attended a rally in Dublin city centre in support of the nurses’ campaign for pay improvements to tackle recruitment and retention issues.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSupporters of a nurses and midwives protest at Merrion Square on Saturday linked to the now suspended nationwide strike. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe bottom line of the proposed new deal to end the wave of strikes by nurses is that many nursing personnel will end up with more money coming out of the dispute than they had at the start.However, many of them will end up with less than they hoped and a lot less than the 12 per cent their union was seeking.It would be hard to categorise the Labour Court recommendation as a cave-in by the Government. But it is a managed retreat from a hardline position which leaves question marks over the future of the public sector pay agreement.The Government had argued consistently over recent weeks that outside of the provisions of the existing pay deal there would be no additional remuneration provided for nursing staff during the lifetime of the current accord, which runs until the end of 2020.Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe insisted last night that the additional payments on offer under the Labour Court recommendation would not breach the current accord.However, the Government is not the final arbiter of whether this is the case or not.Lansdowne RoadIn November 2016, Donohoe and the then minister for justice Frances Fitzgerald maintained that a €50 million package of measures recommended by the Labour Court to avert a threatened strike by gardaí was within the framework of the Lansdowne Road public service pay accord that was then in place.Other unions begged to differ and within a few weeks the Government had to bring forward a wage rise for all other public service staff at an additional cost of €120 million.Last night, the country’s largest public service trade union, Fórsa, said it would study the detail of the Labour Court recommendation regarding the nurses’ dispute, “and any implications it may have for other civil and public service grades”.“We expect that other unions will do the same, and that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions Public Services Committee will consider the matter in due course.”Mr Donohoe declined to set out the cost of the new proposals or to be specific as to where the money to fund them would come from. He said he first wanted to brief the Cabinet on Tuesday.However, the Health Service Executive had indicated previously that there was no money in its budget for this year to meet the cost of additional pay rises for nurses.Well-designed choreographyWhile many in Government may be wary about the potential cost of the nurses’ deal, there is no doubt Ministers will be very pleased and extremely relieved that the strikes scheduled for three consecutive days this week have been suspended.Throughout Monday there seemed to be a well-designed choreography in place that led to the planned strikes being called off at teatime.Shortly after lunch, the Labour Court said it would formally intervene in the dispute after reflecting on informal contacts it had had with unions and management over the weekend.A Labour Court hearing was quickly convened followed by the speedy issuing of a recommendation aimed at ending the dispute.Within an hour, the executive committee of the Irish Nurses’ and Midwives’ Organisation had agreed to suspend the planned strikes while Donohoe and Minister for Health Simon Harris waited inside Government Buildings to emerge and welcome the developments."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3790364.1549923652!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit talks constructively resume in brussels","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe UK Brexit secretary  Stephen Barclay and the chief European Union negotiator Michel Barnier met for dinner in Brussels on Monday night.

Brexit talks resumed in Brussels “constructively” on Monday night over a dinner between UK Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay and the chief European Union negotiator Michel Barnier. A British spokesman said the meeting was a follow-up to last week’s talks between British prime minister Theresa May and European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker to discuss “whether a way through can be found that would be acceptable to the UK parliament and the EU”. They agreed to meet again in the coming days and said officials would carry on technical work. Mr Barnier is understood to have repeated the commission’s insistence that the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation but to have said that there is room to seek changes to the accompanying political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and EU. Mr Barclay will go to Strasbourg on Tuesday to meet leaders of the European Parliament groups. At the dinner in the UK embassy to the EU were Mr Barclay, the UK chief negotiator Olly Robbins and the British Permanent Representative to the EU, Tim Barrow. Mr Barnier was accompanied by his two deputies in the EU Brexit Task Force, Sabine Weyand and Stephane Riso. The dinner menu consisted of pan fired North Sea sole with Scottish scallops and Welsh samphire, roast duck breast with peppercorn sauce and Pembrokeshire potato dauphin, pear parfait with vanilla and hazelnut ice cream, and a British cheeseboard.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVenezuelan migrants climb on a truck on the road from Cúcuta to Pamplona in  Colombia as humanitarian aid is blocked from entering the country. Photograph: Raul ArboledaAFPIn dismissing the need for the international aid operation being organised by his political opponents, President Nicolás Maduro defiantly said Venezuelans are not anyone’s beggars.Like others who have made it here and cannot afford to get anywhere else, Aida Farfan ekes out her days approaching cars stopped at red lights, her two-year-old daughter in one arm, the other asking for the small change she hopes will be enough to buy them an evening meal.Four months ago, Aida and her husband left their home on the outskirts of the Venezuelan capital Caracas in search of one thing only – food. “He had a good job working for a delivery company,” she explains. “He earned a minimum wage but that used to be enough. But now with hyperinflation it buys you nothing, if there was something to buy. But there isn’t. Even the state-run supermarkets are empty. I had to think of my child so we left.”Like most of the estimated one million who have fled into Colombia, Aida crossed over the Simón Bolívar International Bridge, named after the South American liberator who was the supposed inspiration for the populist Bolivarian revolution of Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez.Closed to all but foot traffic since 2015, it is the busiest of the two frontier bridges open, an estimated 40,000 people crossing it daily.Others are hawking goods they hope to sell for money to buy the food and medicines they can no longer get back across the border, turning the hardscrabble neighbourhood of Parada that borders it into a ramshackle open-air market where everything is negotiable.Erika Martes and her cousin, Sonia, head back across the bridge after buying food and basic supplies (Parada does a roaring trade in toilet paper). “Some of our family got out to Ecuador and they are able to send us the money to buy food here,” says Erika. She still has a job back in Venezuela, but with inflation heading for 10 million per cent this year “your salary isn’t worth anything. What I earn in a month is not enough even to buy one bottle of gas.”But for the poorest of those who have crossed over, the neighbourhood has become a temporary home. They sleep in its litter-strewn squares at night, occasionally harassed by local police and vulnerable to the criminal paramilitaries that control the region, which has long been home to a thriving contraband trade.Among those wandering the dusty streets desperate for help is Maribel Mantilla, medical prescription in hand. She travelled more than 1,250km from Venezuela’s Caribbean island of Margarita to Cúcuta because, lacking a passport, she knew she could at least cross into Colombia using only her identity card.The grandmother came with her family in part to find medicine to treat her stomach tumour. But she cannot even afford the €5 to fulfil the prescription she was given by the medics who attended her. Her daughter and granddaughters who travelled with her cut off their long hair and, for €15, sold it to the wigmakers who hawk for business among those coming over the bridge. “But that went on food. Now we are desperate,” she says, tears filling her eyes.Severe malnourishmentThe situation has become so critical, say relief workers at the bridge, that they are seeing more and more cases of severe malnourishment among those arriving.“Our medical staff see kids here who should weigh 12kg but instead are just four,” says David Cañas, the priest in charge of a soup kitchen run by the Catholic diocese of Cúcuta. The kitchen opened in the middle of 2017 serving 700 lunches a day. Now when supplies stretch, it feeds 5,000, with another 2,000 getting a light breakfast of coffee and bread.Even then it has to turn people away. “Because of the demand we now have to focus on women and children and the elderly. We receive people here who travel up to four hours from Venezuela just to get a plate of soup here before they head back,” says Fr David.Among those grateful for the soup kitchen is Endrina Zentenas. She and her three young children were unable to eat on Sunday and Monday’s breakfast at the kitchen broke an enforced fast. “It is very difficult for us all. More and more Venezuelans keep arriving. We cannot live any more in our own country so people will keep coming here. We need help!”Humanitarian aid is arriving in Cúcuta, organised by Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who declared himself interim president last month in the latest bid to eject Maduro from power. But his goal is to transport it this week over another bridge in Cúcuta into Venezuela itself. On Monday, the opposition said more than 100,000 people had already signed up as volunteers to receive and distribute the aid.But the Venezuelan military has blockaded the Tienditas Bridge over which the aid is supposed to pass and many of the refugees in Cúcuta have no doubt Maduro will be true to his word and keep it out. While they acknowledge the situation back in Venezuela is increasingly desperate, they also ask if the aid, or at least some of it, could not be distributed among Venezuelans in Cúcuta if it cannot cross the border.“The thing is we all know that if the aid crosses into Venezuela it will be robbed by the . . ,” says Herman Rojas, who instead of finishing his sentence taps his shoulders to refer to the criminal mafias headed up by high-ranking officers in the Venezuelan security forces."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3790292.1549918055!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may to ask mps for more time to secure brexit backstop changes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May  greets Malta’s prime minister Joseph Muscat: former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has said he would accept a deal with a time-limited backstop. Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaTheresa May hopes to convince the House of Commons on Tuesday to give her another fortnight’s grace to keep pushing for changes to the Irish backstop – despite the insistence of EU negotiator Michel Barnier that it is Britain that must now compromise.With 45 days to go until the UK is due by law to leave the EU, with or without a deal, the British prime minister will address MPs about progress in the Brexit talks, No 10 Downing Street said on Monday.She is unlikely to signal any shift towards a closer future relationship with the EU, after writing to Jeremy Corbyn to underline her continued objections to a customs union, and instead she will focus on the backstop.“We are absolutely clear on this: we’re not considering Jeremy Corbyn’s customs proposals, we’re not considering any proposals to remain in the customs union. We must have our own, independent trade policy,” Mrs May’s spokesman said.Instead, Mrs May will stress her continued focus on the backstop. However, the EU’s chief negotiator insisted on Monday there was no question of Brussels giving in to Downing Street’s demands.“We’re waiting for clarity and movement from the United Kingdom, ” Mr Barnier told reporters after talks in Luxembourg with the country’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel. Time limitAt a dinner with Mr Barnier in Brussels later on Monday, the UK’s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, was expected to push Mrs May’s calls for a time limit on the backstop, a unilateral exit mechanism or its replacement with an “alternative arrangement”.Mr Barnier suggested he would offer Mr Barclay little succour. “Tonight I will repeat the EU’s positions. I will listen to what the secretary of state has to tell us concerning the alternative arrangements which the UK would like,” Mr Barnier said. “But it’s not more than a concept today. I will also evaluate the interest from the UK side for possible changes to the political declaration, which, let me remind you, fixes the outline quite precisely for the future separation.”Mr Barclay will travel to Strasbourg on Tuesday to set out the UK’s stance to MEPs, and the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will take the same message to Paris.In Westminster, meanwhile, Mrs May is expected to confirm she will hold another Brexit vote in parliament on February 27th.Reworked dealOpponents of a no-deal Brexit inside her cabinet and on the Tory back benches want to hear confirmation from the prime minister that any motion she tables then will be amendable.That would allow them to have another attempt at winning a majority for an amendment that could force the prime minister’s hand – if she has not brought a reworked version of her Brexit deal back to parliament for MPs’ approval before then.Mrs May’s hopes of cobbling together a majority were boosted on Monday as the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said he would be willing to accept a deal with a time-limited backstop.Mr Johnson told a meeting in parliament, “I think it must be pretty obvious that if you are going to have a time limit to the backstop – and I think that would be very good – it has got to fall before the next election.”Some more hardline Brexiters have suggested the backstop must be removed altogether from the withdrawal agreement, but that looks highly unlikely to win favour in Brussels. Downing Street hopes that if Mrs May can win round Mr Johnson, she can split the leave-supporting European Research Group (ERG). – "},{"url":null,"title":"kumbh mela worlds largest religious gathering pictures","story":"Thousands of Hindu devout arrive to take a dip at Sangam, the confluence of three sacred rivers the Yamuna, the Ganges and the mythical Saraswati, on Monday, as part of the Kumbh Mela or Pitcher Festival, in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh state, IndiaMan held on suspicion of arson as firefighters tackle huge blaze at mental health hospital NHS ageism means elderly people with depression far less likely to be referred for therapy Planning appeals for controversial housing developments should be cut by five months, official review findsTesco knows more about its customers than NHS does its patients Social media firms that breach duty of care laws \u0026#39must face criminal sanctions\u0026#39US Democrats rocked by anti-Semitism row as Muslim congresswoman apologisesBBC, Facebook and Google face new curbs on their power over news to safeguard quality journalismFamous and Fighting Crime, review: Penny Lancaster stole the show in this arresting reality seriesComment: Deselecting Brexit rebels would end up poisoning the Tory party – just look at what\u0026#39s happened to LabourKarren Brady says she has ‘sense of duty’ to Sir Philip Green’s employees -

But nowhere is the prospect of regime change more likely than Sudan.Almost since the revolt began on December 19, rapidly spreading to towns and cities across Sudan, young medics have been at the forefront of the protests demanding Mr Bashir’s regisnation. They have also been among its most prominent victims, none more so than Babiker Abdelhamid, who was shot dead in Khartoum on January 17.Dr Babiker, who was 27, was only one of 45 people who have been killed by the security forces since the protests began, according to human rights groups. But the nature of his death, and the controversy it has ignited, has become a rallying call for the protesters, increasing rather than diminishing their determination to oust the president.According to witnesses, Dr Babiker walked out of his home, where he had been treating protesters,  and attempted to beg security officers to allow him to take the wounded to hospital. Moments later, a gunshot rang out and an hour later he was dead.“He walked down the street slowly, with his hands raised,” a colleague said. “He was trying to tell them he had critical cases and to ask them to reopen the road to Royal Care Hospital, which they had cut off. Then he was killed.Anti-government protesters rally in Khartoum, SudanFacing mounting outrage, President Bashir attempted to blame the killing on a foreign plot to bring chaos to Sudan. “The doctor who was killed… was killed by a weapon that did not belong to the army, or the NISS (National Intelligence and Security Services, or police,” he told supporters at a rally in the south of the country.“He was killed by someone among the demonstrators.”Yet there is no question that Sudan’s doctors, the most formidable group in a growing array of opponents to the regime, have borne the brunt of Mr Bashir’s increasingly violent and desperate response to the protests. At least one other doctor, Muawiya Khalil, has been killed, allegedly shot dead inside his house. Many more have been arrested, including the head of the Sudan Doctors Syndicate, his deputy and other members of the executive committee.Medics and nurses were beaten up after security forces raided two hospitals in Khartoum, firing live ammunition and teargas into the wards before dragging wounded protesters off their beds and taking them to secret detention centres. The assault on the medical profession partly reflects regime anger at doctors after they called a strike, encouraged other professions to follow suit and then threw open private hospitals to treat the wounded for free.But it is also an indication of the regime’s longstanding fear of the medical profession and the reverence with which it is held in Sudanese society.After seizing power in 1989, Mr Bashir banned independent trade unions, locked up and tortured opponents in secret prisons known as “ghost houses” and silenced dissent.But the doctors refused to be cowed, staging a strike within months of the coup — the regime responded by allegedly torturing to death one of the organisers at one of the ghost houses — and several more since.The medical profession’s opposition to the regime was driven by the distaste of secular doctors towards the coalition of Islamists and military figures that have run it and which allowed bin Laden to live in the country from 1991 to 1996. There was particular fury that Islamist militants were allowed to infiltrate a medical university in Khartoum, where students — including at least 16 Britons — were sent to join ISIL in Syria.But resentment is more deep-seated too. Sudan’s medical service was once among Africa’s most efficient. The Kitchener School of Medicine produced some of the continent’s best doctors.Tear gas is seen as Sudanese demonstrators take part in an an anti-government protest in KhartoumBut in recent decades, the health system has all but collapsed. As the Bashir regime erted government funds towards the military, slashing health expenditure to just two percent of the budget, once-functioning state hospitals became understaffed and poorly equipped. Medicines ran in short supply, free healthcare was mostly abandoned. Corrupt government officials plundered hospitals and ran dodgy procurement tenders. Unable to save lives, doctors were sometimes beaten up by the parents of children who had died in their care.Doctors’ attempts to galvanise public anger largely failed, however, with many Sudanese still too scared to confront their government. But an economic crisis in recent years, the legacy of US sanctions, lifted in 2016, and economic mismanagement in a country ranked by Transparency International as among the six most corrupt in the world, has changed the dynamic. Starved of cash, the government began printing money, sending inflation soaring to 70 percent, second only to Venezuela.Forced to adopt austerity measures, Mr Bashir lifted subsidies on basic staples, causing bread prices to treble. The rapid devaluation of the Sudanese pound had meant that the price of medicines, which are mostly imported, soaring by between 150 percent and 300 percent in the last 12 months.December’s protests began spontaneously in the city of Atbara, but they were quickly given direction and purpose by the Sudanese Professionals Organisation, an umbrella group dominated by doctors, which has marshalled near daily protests and industrial action across the country.“Demands for major healthcare changes have been repeatedly ignored over the year,” doctors’ groups said in a statement. “There has been a blatant policy of  systematically destroying the once free national health service. Our only option, coupled by our professional duty, was to escalate our protests.”The Bashir regime has thwarted previous protests, killing some 180 people during the last significant uprising in 2013. Yet Sudan observers say that, this time, the fear factor has been broken, with violence increasing rather than deterring the protesters’ determination.Other professionals have joined demands for Mr Bashir’s resignation, including professors at Khartoum University, another hallowed colonial institution that began its days as the Gordon Memorial College in 1902. Other groups, most significantly dock workers at Port Sudan, have joined the strikes.And even Sudan’s normally cautious opposition, sensing Mr Bashir’s growing vulnerability, has come out in support of the protests. Last week, Sadiq al-Mahdi, the bearded Oxford-educated former prime minister overthrown by Mr Bashir in 1989, demanded the president’s resignation.A Sudanese protester carries a portrait of President Omar al-Bashir with Arabic writing that reads \u0026#34down and that is all\u0026#34 Some observers see Mr al-Mahdi, great-grandson of Muhammad Ahmed, the Mahdi whose warriors killed General Gordon in Khartoum in 1885, as a potential candidate to head a transitional government — even though he is 83.President Bashir is not beaten yet. Middle Eastern states say they support the regime and Qatar, which has embarked on a multi-million pound development of the British-built port at Suakin, may bail him out financially. Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group, the Kremlin-linked outfit that has fought in Syria and Ukraine, have been spotted in Khartoum and are possibly assisting the regime’s repression.Yet there are rumours of splits within the regime, with even some of his generals reportedly sensing that only by sacrificing Mr Bashir will the protests, increasingly well organised and ever more determined, end.Some observers say there may be a peaceful way out, with suggestions that the president would be willing to step down if the International Criminal Court dropped its case accusing him of involvement in killing hundreds of thousands during the suppression of a rebellion in the Darfur region.Mohammed Ibrahim, a Sudanese-British billionaire and prominent critic of the Bashir regime, has led calls for the indictment to be lifted, warning that otherwise the demise of one of the Arab world’s most stubborn leaders is likely to be protracted and violent affair.“If that is going to save lives, if it is going to save us from a bloody civil war, let the man go in peace,” Mr Ibrahim told the BBC.Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Man held on suspicion of arson as firefighters tackle huge blaze at mental health hospital NHS ageism means elderly people with depression far less likely to be referred for therapy Planning appeals for controversial housing developments should be cut by five months, official review findsTesco knows more about its customers than NHS does its patients Social media firms that breach duty of care laws \u0026#39must face criminal sanctions\u0026#39US Democrats rocked by anti-Semitism row as Muslim congresswoman apologisesFamous and Fighting Crime, review: Penny Lancaster stole the show in this arresting reality seriesBBC, Facebook and Google face new curbs on their power over news to safeguard quality journalismComment: Deselecting Brexit rebels would end up poisoning the Tory party – just look at what\u0026#39s happened to LabourTheresa May to rule out staying in EU customs union after backlash by Eurosceptic MPsKarren Brady says she has ‘sense of duty’ to Sir Philip Green’s employees -

The Topshop owner paid huge sums, in one case in excess of £1million, to staff members to keep quiet about their allegations.The news of the regulator’s involvement comes as the  revealed how crucial witness testimonies were left out of a report into sexual harassment.The SRA is understood to have begun looking into the use of NDAs at Arcadia after receiving a complaint from Jess Phillips, the Labour MP who sits on the women and equalities committee.In a response the SRA said in a letter to Ms Phillips: “We are looking into this matter and whether our principles of professional behaviour and guidance have been followed.”It is understood that information regarding the internal investigation and the NDAs has now been provided to the regulator.Last week, the  revealed that two male executives told a lawyer working for Arcadia that they had witnessed Sir Philip as he “slapped” a woman’s bottom on several occasions. However, their comments did not appear into a final report which is understood to have concluded that the business had not sexually harassment a female executive.Deborah Cooper, a lawyer working for Arcadia, carried out the investigation.One witness, a senior finance executive, is understood to have said that although he could not remember a specific meeting where an incident allegedly took place, he had witnessed Sir Philip slap the woman\u0027s bottom and threaten to smack her on other occasions.However, it is understood that the final report only stated that the executive could not recall a specific meeting in question.A second witness also appeared to back up the woman\u0027s claims when he told the lawyer that he had seen Sir Philip slap the woman\u0027s bottom on the way to a meeting, which made her distressed it was later claimed he had retracted his evidence.  Shortly after the initial report was delivered, the female executive is believed to have appealed, amid allegations of a cover up.Ms Cooper later alleged that she was bullied by the businessman during the course of the probe, a court was told during a hearing about the case.The SRA put out a warning to legal professionals about the misuse of NDAs to cover up potentially criminal behaviour in March after Zelda Perkins, a former assistant to Harvery Weinstein broke her agreement to reveal the details within it. Late last year in advice to lawyers regarding balancing duties in litigation the SRA added: NDAs have a legitimate role to play, but it has become clear that some might include clauses that seek to prevent lawful disclosure of issues such as discrimination, harassment or even sexual abuse.Ms Philips said: “Lawyers are there as officers of the court and they have got a responsibility to hold up the law and were they work in their clients’ interests above the letter of the law they must be held responsible. “Sexual harassment is a clear breach of the law.”The SRA did not respond to a request to comment. They have previously said that they do not comment on ongoing investigations.If misconduct is found to have taken place the SRA can issue written warnings, fines or even suspend or strike off solicitors and issue unlimited fines. Neither Arcadia nor Ms Cooper responded to a request for commentDAC Beachcroft, the firm called in to advise Arcadia on the settlement agreements, have said that they cannot comment on client matters.Man held on suspicion of arson as firefighters tackle huge blaze at mental health hospital NHS ageism means elderly people with depression far less likely to be referred for therapy Planning appeals for controversial housing developments should be cut by five months, official review findsTesco knows more about its customers than NHS does its patients Social media firms that breach duty of care laws \u0026#39must face criminal sanctions\u0026#39US Democrats rocked by anti-Semitism row as Muslim congresswoman apologisesFamous and Fighting Crime, review: Penny Lancaster stole the show in this arresting reality seriesBBC, Facebook and Google face new curbs on their power over news to safeguard quality journalismComment: Deselecting Brexit rebels would end up poisoning the Tory party – just look at what\u0026#39s happened to LabourTheresa May to rule out staying in EU customs union after backlash by Eurosceptic MPsKarren Brady says she has ‘sense of duty’ to Sir Philip Green’s employees - including her daughterOak trees to be banned from Chelsea Flower Show for the first time due to Processionary Moth infestationThomas Markle\u0026#39s leaked letter from Duchess of Sussex could provoke legal action from PalaceUK\u0026#39s first vegan \u0026#34cheese\u0026#34 monger is misleading customers, dairy industry complainsChris Grayling insists he is not to blame for no-deal Brexit ferry fiasco Full extent of Labour\u0026#39s anti-Semitism problem revealed as party admits  receiving hundreds of complaintsRussia to disconnect its internet from rest of the world while it puts in protection measuresDispatch: Inside Syria\u0026#39s \u0026#39Camp of Death\u0026#39 where British mothers and children struggle to survive in legal limboBBC News at Ten to be cut to make way for youth programmingComment: Stop knocking Chris Grayling.

It was an opportunity to reward homegrown talent, certainly, but the ceremony served\u0026nbspto put the\u0026nbsppieces into place ahead of the Oscars, which takes place in just two weeks.At this year’s Baftas,\u0026nbspThe Favourite\u0026nbspled the nominations with 12\u0026nbspleaving Alfonso Cuarón’s\u0026nbspRoma\u0026nbsptrailing behind with seven – not that having the numbers on your side is any guarantee of victory on the night. However, on this occasion, it did.Below are the evening\u0027s biggest talking points.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe Favourite ruled the night, despite Roma winning Best FilmThe Baftas had dual victors when it came to the ceremony. It was a night that belonged\u0026nbspto both Yorgos Lanthimos’s historical drama, which won seven awards, and Alfonso Cuarón’s Netflix-produced drama Roma, which won four awards.\u0026nbspThe Baftas 2019 winners list in full – updating liveThe Favourite may have a Greek director in\u0026nbspLanthimos, but the period piece received significant British funding, alongside being anchored by a British story (a love triangle between Queen Anne and two confidantes) and a largely UK-hailing cast, including Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz, who won Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively.\u0026nbspThe film not only won Outstanding British Film, but also won for Original Screenplay, Production Design and Make Up \u0026amp Hair. Roma, meanwhile, won the ultimate prize of the night, Best Film. Cuaron also won for Director, Cinematography and Film Not in the English Language.\u0026nbspJoanna Lumley played it (too) safeWhen Britain is currently facing one of the most turbulent political crises of recent history, it seems so faint-hearted of the ceremony to keep proceedings so… dry. Host Joanna Lumley’s monologue failed to deliver any topical gags, mostly consisting of a string of compliments and a cute joke about how The Favourite was, indeed, the night’s favourite. The only real jabs were saved for the Oscars and A Star is Born director Bradley Cooper. “Thank goodness Bafta has a host, though I suspect that has to do with the fact that I’m not on Twitter,” Lumley joked early on. Oscars organisers have confirmed that this year’s ceremony will have no official host for the first time in 30 years, after Kevin Hart stepped down when a number of old tweets resurfaced in which the comedian expressed homophobic views.Cooper, who is the star, director, producer, and screenwriter of A Star is Born, was declared by Lumley to be\u0026nbspa “multi-talented genius” who “needs to learn how to delegate”. While referencing Alfonso Cuarón’s nominations in six different categories, Lumley then turned to Cooper and added: “pull your finger out, sweetheart”.The speeches, too, were kept oddly short and free of political comment. Accepting the prize for Best Film, Cuarón\u0026nbspexpressed his gratitude for Roma winning during a time “when fear and anger would ide us” – perhaps he’s saving his most direct attacks on Trump’s policies for when he (very likely) wins at the upcoming Academy Awards. Andy Serkis made a quick reference while presenting the prize for Original Music, noting that: “Music is like Laurel without Hardy, Queen without Freddie Mercury - it\u0027s Britain without Europe”.\u0026nbspThe most controversial comment of the evening by far was made by presenter Eddie Marsan. While presenting the award for Best Costume Design with Cynthia Erivo, the actor described the difficulty of creating historically accurate costumes for films. He then added that it was particularly difficult to do since Britain had “reinvented its past to justify Brexit”. Perhaps the winners simply had no time, with such truncated speeches, to make their political case.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Baftas 2019: Best dressed guests on the red carpet Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The British actor looks chic in a white tuxedo by Stella McCartney on the red carpet.

Mahershala Ali beat Richard E Grant, the expected winner, to Best Supporting Actor, winning for his role as jazz musician Don Shirley in Green Book. Rami Malek, meanwhile, cemented himself as the favourite when it comes to the Academy Awards, winning Best Actor for his role as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. Thanking Dexter Fletcher, who stepped in as director when Bryan Singer was fired from the project, Malek said: “Thank you so much to Queen and to greatest outsider of them all, for being so unwavering and unflinching and uncompromising in every which way – thank you again, Freddie Mercury.”Letitia Wright proves the power of Marvel\u0026nbspLetitia Wright’s win for the publicly voted Rising Star Award proved that Marvel will always have its sway when it comes to the average cinemagoer. Although she’s proven herself time and time again in her performances – from Black Mirror to Young Vic’s staging of The Convert – it’s her role as Black Panther’s fan favourite character, inventor Shuri, that ultimately won her prize. In her speech, she said: “I identify myself as a child of God and I can’t get up here without thanking God. A few years ago, I saw myself in a deep state of depression and I literally wanted to quit acting.” She then credited God for helping her through this period, alongside an e-mail from Bafta asking her to take part in its Breakthrough Brits programme. “So this wasn’t an overnight thing. This wasn’t a click of the finger success. I’m still a work in progress,” she added. “I want to thank everybody that said yes to me.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A rising hash rate will also raise concerns about bitcoin\u0027s environmental impact, with its electricity consumption estimated to be more than the country of Ireland.Other analysts had warned that a fall below $3,000 would have signalled a blood bath for bitcoin, as traders sought to offload the crashing cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The hunt for such alternatives inevitably leads to examples of other borders and it is usually only a matter of time before someone volunteers the Switzerland-France border as a model. Switzerland is in Schengen (so no need for passport checks) and regulations on goods are broadly aligned with those of the EU. Switzerland is not in the EU’s customs union nor its VAT regime, and that means border checks are required. Its watches and cuckoo clocks literally run like clockwork, so, the argument goes, must its borders.But it’s not as simple as that. As the Swiss Federal Customs Administration makes clear, even though they have the latest technology and much paperwork is done away from the border, there is still some physical infrastructure and delays of up to four hours if a lorry is searched.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 2018 Switzerland launched a new IT-based customs transformation programme. This programme aims to simplify, harmonise and fully digitise customs tax and duty collection processes. It should be in place by 2026.However, this programme will not make controls at the border redundant. Quite the opposite. Because routine administrative work and bureaucratic procedures will be replaced by IT-based solutions, personnel will be freed up. These people will be used to strengthen security, especially for control functions and reinforcement of criminal prosecution. Some of these functions will continue to apply at the border. Hence, even with a highly technologically advanced customs management system, controls at the border will not become obsolete and nor will customs infrastructure vanish.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

Norway is not in the customs union either, so the origin of goods must be checked. Again, Norwegian Customs make clear what is required. Although it is technologically advanced, there is still a delay. The average time from when a lorry arrives at the border to when it leaves is about 20 minutes. This includes roughly ten minutes waiting time, three to six minutes of handling time, and the time spent coming off the road to complete the customs process. And there’s physical infrastructure too. All this despite existing agreements on customs facilitation, transit and rules of origin between the EU and the European Free Trade Association states, of which Norway is one.Less often talked about are Andorra and San Marino. Both are small European nations that are in a customs union with the EU. Although Andorra’s treaty only covers goods, its borders with Spain and France are strictly controlled. This is due to the fact that Andorra has no VAT (yet) and is known as low tax territory. Thus, smuggling has always been a concern of the neighbouring countries. The customs union with San Marino covers all goods except coal and steel. It has traditionally kept an open border without checks at its frontier with Italy. However, it levies an import tax, at 17 per cent.The Bulgaria-Turkey border is worse. Turkey is in a customs union with the EU, which removes tariffs and quantitative restrictions in bilateral trade between EU member states and Turkey for the goods covered. It also sets a single external tariff for both the EU and Turkey, so they charge the same duties on imports from non-EU countries.Unlike the customs union covering EU member states, the EU-Turkey agreement is incomplete. It covers industrial goods but not agricultural products (except certain processed agricultural products), coal and steel products, or public procurement.Finally, the border between Turkey and the EU is bureaucratic and lengthy. Lorry drivers need an export declaration, a customs permit, invoices for the products they are transporting, insurance certificates and a transport permit for each EU nation they will drive through. The queues at the border can be up to 17 kilometres long and the wait as much as 30 hours. While Turkey has invested significantly in modernising its border, with checks taking place an hour inland, Bulgarian officials check the paperwork for every truck and x-ray all refrigerated lorries.Which brings us to the US-Canada border. Again, much resource has been put into streamlining this border but there are still delays - the length can be seen online. All of this indicates that regardless of the technological capabilities of the EU’s neighbouring countries, there will be checks and the borders and this means infrastructure.By Professor Catherine Barnard, senior fellow The UK in a Changing Europe and Dr Georges Baur.

Not only do they use the flights – so do their families and friendsCurrent European passengers’ rights rules, known as EC2612004, stipulate high payouts for delays and cancellations that cannot be attributed to “extraordinary circumstances”. Buried in a document called Beyond the Horizon: The Future of UK Aviation, the government says “the UK will not fall below current standards of protection when we leave the EU”814 Entry regulations to the European UnionFrom 11pm GMT on 29 March 2019, UK travellers will become “third-country nationals” when travelling to Schengen countries and subject to the standard rules of admission for citizens of nations such as the US, Japan and Australia. That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure.914 Online registration prior to travel – ETIASFrom 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area – including British travellers – will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries.A large number of travel providers – even including National Express coaches – have added “Brexit clauses” to their terms and conditions. These generally specify that they will not be liable for “consequential losses” as a result of Brexit-related issues1114 ‘Fast track’ lanes for passport control entering EU countriesBritish passport holders will not be able to use them, and must join the queue for third-country nationals.The ferry industry insists vessels will continue to sail. The UK Chamber of Shipping says: “Unlike the carriage of cargo, trade deals do not have a significant effect on the cruise and passenger ferry industry. The explicit standardisation of commodity codes and tariffs associated with trade deals have little relevance to holidaymakers.”The EU says: “If you fall ill or have an accident during a visit to another EU country, as an EU citizen you have the right to receive the necessary public healthcare in any EU country under the same conditions as people in the host country.” The EHIC also works in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. From 30 March 2019, the law banning mobile phone firms from charging extra for calls and data in Europe will cease, though operators have yet to set out exactly what will replace it. In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.This seems to be having knock-on effects on other corporate decisions.Investment in the car industry fell by 50 per cent in 2018, with Brexit blamed as the prime culprit.And investment across the whole economy fell over the first nine months of the year according to the Office for National Statistics.Even a written constitution can’t save us from Brexit nowA survey by the Institute of Directors suggests that a fifth of large firms have already moved some operations abroad due to Brexit.Construction activity appears have slumped in 2019.What impact has all this corporate trepidation had on the UK economy?The latest indications are that overall GDP growth slumped in the second half of last year.And the Bank of England expects growth of just 1.2 per cent in 2019 – which would be the worst since the 2008-09 recession.This is partly due to slowing world growth, but also Brexit. And that Bank of England forecast assumes a smooth Brexit rather than a rupture at the end of March.The view of most economists is that the economic damage of Brexit is indeed already being done – and it is hurting the UK even if we end up avoiding a no-deal disaster later this month.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

What began as a startup is now one of London’s leading destinations for yoga and\u0026nbsppilates, with five studios across the capital and more than 750 classes per week.Created with Sketch.Yoga Inc. The phenomenal popularity of yoga Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sattin had no initial plans to work in the wellbeing industry. “My father was a doctor and really wanted one of his three sons to follow in his footsteps,” he says.“For years, I thought that’s what I was going to do too. But I ended up going to law school and eventually became a lawyer, setting up my own practice when I was 27.”Looking for a better way to relax while studying, Sattin taught himself to meditate and the seeds for an altogether different life were sewn – not that he knew it at the time. In 1985, one of his colleagues who thought he was a little “left of centre” suggested he try yoga and sent Sattin to a private class in northwest London. The experience turned out to be life-changing.Sattin says: “It might sound clichéd but it’s one of these experiences that become more profound when you look back at them. At the time, I just realised instantly that I needed to change.“I was a heavy smoker, I used to smoke 40 cigarettes a day and a drink about 14 cups of coffee with two sugars each. Within three months of practising I quit all of that.” “It wasn’t that I suddenly gave up practising law, shaved my head and wore orange robes, but it was a catalyst for change. It encouraged me to do better.”After 18 years of practising law he decided he had enough in 1996. Sattin agreed to a year’s notice, which gave him time to think about his next steps. He says: “I was involved in the set up of Yo! Sushi and Protocol Multimedia Talent Agency. I was talking to some friends in Los Angeles, who said, ‘Why don’t you do what you love?’ and I realised yoga was what I was the most interested in.” He travelled to the US to see how studios like YogaWorks in Los Angeles and Jivamukti yoga in New York operated. “The aim was to see what they were doing wrong and what I could learn from their mistakes,” Sattin says.“Once I got the concept, I was very passionate about doing it and when you have that passion, people want you to succeed,” he adds.Sattin used his network to fund the company and managed to raise £500,000. In 2000, with the help of a company board, some of whose members he found while walking his golden retriever in Regent’s Park, the first Triyoga studio in Primrose Hill was born.Early investors included David Svendsen, who was then chair\u0026nbspof Microsoft, while Simon Low joined the company to be director of yoga, a role he kept until 2002.If you are a little shy about stepping inside this impressive mecca for yogis, you shouldn’t be. The whole concept was to create a place for all.Sattin says: “From the beginning, the idea was to create a place where anyone could practice yoga. It had to be authentic and we also wanted to have a wide range of classes. I knew from my own experience that people want different things at different times. The number of people who attend Triyoga classes each year“Sometimes you might want something dynamic and sometimes you might want something restorative. We wanted to help our customers to find the type of practice that was appropriate for them.” With its proximity to the London homes of Sadie Frost and Gwyneth Paltrow, who have both attended classes there, the Primrose Hill centre quickly become a byword for glamour – an image that Sattin is visibly uncomfortable with.He says: “When we first opened, our studio Primrose Hill wasn’t quite as cool and glamorous as it is now. It had the feeling of a village and it was quite awkward to get there. It was interesting as an area. We never sought to attract celebrities, our aim was to give time and space to practice to anyone that comes through our doors.”For the\u0026nbspfirst full year, the company’s turnover was £393,000, and in 2017 this jumped to an impressive £6.2m.\u0026nbspMore than 600,000 people attend Triyoga classes every year and in 2015 it opened a\u0026nbspteacher-training academy.A branch opened in Covent Garden in 2003, followed by Soho in 2005, and another two studios in Shoreditch and Ealing opened their doors in 2017.Of course, there were also some obstacles. Triyoga was forced out of its coveted location in Primrose Hill after losing a three-year battle against a development firm. Fortunately, Sattin promptly found an alternative venue in Camden in an old piano factory in Jamestown Road – a short walk away from its original location.Each studio now has a café and a shop. The company also offers teacher training, retreats and holidays. Sattin says: “As we’ve expanded, we’ve tried to get better, and improve our service and our offering. We always had changing rooms and showers – which was quite unusual at the time. But we’ve added cafés, shops and more treatments.“Essentially, we wanted our customers to have a comfy space where they wanted to stay and hangout. We wanted them to feel like they were part of something.” The market has changed considerably since Triyoga first opened its doors nearly 20 years ago. Competition might be more brutal than ever – but Sattin says the quality of the teaching at Triyoga is what makes them different from rivals.He says: “We are passionate with the quality of our teaching and our treatments. We now have 122 teachers, not including those who come for guest’s lessons.“We look at how qualified they are, but also if they teach the way that is right for us. As a basic rule our teachers need to have a minimum of five years’ experience. Each one goes through a thorough interview process and also teaches a class to the team and to our clients.”The company may not have embraced goat yoga, but it has been quick to evolve with the times – last year, Triyoga spearheaded an initiative for Consent Cards, the first of its kind, in response to the #MeToo movement. Sattin explains: “In yoga, some of our students may wish to be corrected, but others just prefer not to be touched. “These allow all students to put a card on their mat, so if they don’t want to be adjusted, the teacher knows without them having to say anything.”The company hosts a triyoga podcast, which Sattin says is all about confronting issues in the wellness world head-on. This include debates about yoga practices in a #MeToo era and the complex relationship between contemporary yoga and eating disorders.Perhaps it is down to the calming effect of yoga, but Sattin is refreshingly humble when talking about the centre’s success. When asked about oversea expansion plans, he says: “We don’t have plans to expand outside of the UK for now. I want to keep our values and continue investing in the right people, look at how we can improve our service and provide even better care for our clients.”A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, consumer confidence has started to come under pressure with British households £1,500 worse off on average than was forecast before the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.Households had been supplementing meagre earnings growth by increasing their levels of debt, but consumer credit growth dropped in December.The Bank of England reported\u0026nbspthe annual growth of unsecured lending in the month fell to 6.6 per cent, down from 7.2 per cent in November.This was the weakest figure since December 2014. Credit card lending growth slowed to 7.1 per cent, down from 7.9 per cent the previous month.A number of economists precisted the slowdown would continue into 2019 unless the government could deliver a degree of certainty about\u0026nbspthe UK’s trading relationship with the EU.Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said Brexit ucertainty and slowing global growth were “suffocating” economic\u0026nbspactivity.\u0026nbspHe added: “The continued decline in business investment is a blackspot for the economy as it undermines the UK’s ability to raise productivity and increase our long-term growth prospects.“It is increasingly likely that the slowdown at the end of 2018 will persist as continued Brexit uncertainty and the raised possibility of a no-deal exit from the EU weigh heavily on UK’s growth prospects.

Come at me, says David BarnettClick to followThe IndependentOasis’s London debut at the Water Rats, January 1994There will be those who have just read the headline and already gone directly to the comments to take issue. For any waverers, I’ll set out my stall again: 1994 was the best year in music. Possibly ever.\u0026nbspStill here? Right, we happy few, let’s unpack this a little. Putting the words “best” and “music” together is always going to be subjective. One woman’s Metallica is another man’s Joe Dolce. And there’s also time and place to take into account. If you were six years old in 1994, you might not have been bothered about contemporary pop. If you were 76, maybe ditto. But there are certain immutable, irrefutable truths, and this is one of them. The year 1994 was spectacular for music on so, so many levels.Perhaps a bit of wider context is needed. To live through 1994 as a relatively young person (I turned 24 in the January) was to be at the centre of what felt like a time of transcendent change in the UK.That was the year the IRA ceasefire was signed, and 911 was still seven years away, and not on on our radar at all. After the breakup of the Soviet Union three years earlier, Russia was more interested in implementing democracy and capitalism than fighting a Cold War. It felt like the dawn of an age – sadly short-lived – when nobody was trying to blow us up.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 1994, Bill Clinton was in the White House, and still a year away from staining his character (and a dress) by not having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. Neil Kinnock’s Labour had somehow lost the 1992 general election, despite everyone being confident the Tory stranglehold was finally over, but in 1994 Labour named Tony Blair as leader of the party, and things...\u0026nbspwell, things could only get better.To live through 1994 as a relatively young person ... was to be at the centre of what felt like a time of transcendent change in the UKAfter what seemed like years of stagnation, there was a whiff of change in the air. Things felt in some way more optimistic. The country felt more inclusive, less isive. There was opportunity, and expectation. It was the year they launched the National Lottery. Any one of us could become a multimillionaire by buying a ticket for a quid.And music reflected this, as it always reflects the world around it. There was a sensation of rapid, almost out-of-control evolution in music. People’s record collections became more eclectic, more wide-ranging, more small-c catholic. The old boundaries seemed to melt away. You didn’t need to choose between being a rocker or a raver or an indie-kid or a popster. You could be all of them at once, because if the bands and artists were refusing to stay in their pigeonholes, why should the public?Why we haven’t had a decent Christmas song since 1994Slap bang in the middle of the year, at the Glastonbury Festival at the end of June, I stood in a field and had a transformative experience watching the progressive techno band Orbital playing a set to what felt like half the people in the world. They had come to Glastonbury to see Oasis, or Rage Against the Machine they had come for Björk and James. They had come to listen to Nick Cave, to jump around to Blur, to dance to M People. And in the end, they all came to watch Orbital playing their bleepy, unnerving, bass-pounding music of the spheres, and for what felt like the first time ever the tribes were all united in the love of music.Of course, that could just be the drugs talking. But look at that Glastonbury line-up! Just one year, one scorching hot June weekend! And you can add to that list St Etienne, Paul Weller, Pulp, Spirtualised, Radiohead...\u0026nbsppossibly the best Glastonbury ever, in the year of the best music ever?That coming together at the Orbital set heralded a sea change for Glastonbury. According to Sheryl Garratt’s excellent book detailing the rise of rave culture, Adventures in Wonderland, Glasto organiser Michael Eavis had previously shied away from having a dance stage because of the negative connotations attached to rave and techno – primarily the drugs, illegal events and mass takeovers at places like Castlemorton two years previously.She wrote: “But after Orbital’s live set stole the show in 1994, a dance stage and dance tents were finally introduced the following year, and Glastonbury has become an annual event on the club calendar.”If I had to fight with myself over this bold claim for 1994 to be music’s finest year, I’d probably employ maybe 1988 as my weapon of choice. That was really the start of rave culture, and where dance music began to cross over with guitar bands, resulting in the baggy Madchester sound epitomised by the Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses, James and\u0026nbspthe Inspiral Carpets.But while that might have been where the seeds of fusion of the genres and inclusivity were sown, I’d argue that it wasn’t until 1994 that those ideas and concepts properly blossomed. And, of course, 1994 was the year of Britpop.It was actually in 1993 that Britpop got going, thanks to a feature in the now defunct music magazine Select. Grunge, with its poster boys Nirvana and their lead singer Kurt Cobain (more of whom anon) had held sway with its nihilistic, fuzzy guitars in Britain for a couple of years among an army of plaid-wearing, chain-smoking disaffected youth. But Select wanted to wave the flag for Blighty, quite literally as that month’s issue featured on its cover Suede’s Brett Anderson against a union jack background and an article\u0026nbspinside headlined, “Who Do You Think You Are Kidding, Mr Cobain?”. Denim, Pulp, Suede, The Auteurs and St Etienne were all featured, in a bid to push British pop back up the agenda.By 1994, two seminal Britpop albums went head to head – as did the bands responsible for them. Oasis released their debut Definitely Maybe, while Blur brought out their third LP, Parklife. Oasis v Blur bubbled under throughout the year, battle lines drawn at the Watford Gap. It was the naughty north vs the sexy south, Manchester’s Oasis and their Beatlesque anthems set against Blur’s cheeky chappy Camden Kinks roisterers. By the following year, the so-called rivalry even made the BBC evening news as the two bands released singles on the same day.If there ever was any proper animosity between Oasis and Blur, it didn’t extend to the fans. Blur or Oasis might have been a perennial pub debate throughout 1994, but I don’t think I knew anyone who didn’t own both Definitely Maybe and Parklife. The rivalry added a bit of spice, and music fans were the winners with two defining albums of the decade.Britpop wasn’t only about Blur and Oasis, of course, though as the cocky lads in the class they tended to get most of the attention. But let us consider some of the other releases that came under the red-white-and-blue Britpop banner:\u0026nbspPulp’s His ’n’\u0026nbspHers, considered to be the album that brought them to mainstream attention, especially for the standout tracks “Do You Remember the First Time?” and “Babies”\u0026nbspEchobelly’s debut Everyone’s Got One, with its spiky, caustic, feminist songs Suede’s second album Dog Man Star, which perhaps exemplified how bands were not afraid to evolve and transform in 1994. Suede’s first album was almost a paean to Bowie with a side order of The Smiths here they’d gone much more personal and perhaps introspective.Another band that completely reinvented itself in 1994 was Primal Scream. Never a band to stick with one musical style, they had, however, found a niche in the dance-rock mash-ups of 1991’s Screamadelica. When they returned in ’94 with Give Out But Don’t Give Up, it could not have been further from the blissed-out rhythms of “Loaded” and “Higher Than the Sun”. The Scream had gone full-on Rolling Stones blues, and the\u0026nbspfirst single from the album, “Rocks”, was the band’s highest-charting release.Had 1994 given us only Britpop, the year would still have deserved a place in posterity. But it was about so much more than that. Select magazine might have jokingly tried to drive America back into the sea the previous year, but US bands released some absolutely classic albums that year.What about Green Day’s Dookie, and its single “Basket Case”? By 1994, REM were stone-cold alt-rock royalty, and while their ninth studio album Monster might not be in everyone’s top five REM albums, it did at least give us the single “What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?”. Weezer released their self-titled debut, and Beck gave us the unalloyed eclectic joy of Mellow Gold and the single “Loser”.But the most influential American band of the era, Nirvana, came to a tragic end when, in April,\u0026nbspleader Kurt Cobain wrote a note to his imaginary childhood friend and then put a shotgun to his chin and pulled the trigger. He had gone and joined that stupid club, the one where the most talented musicians of a generation end their own lives at the age of 27. Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison. The year\u0026nbsphad its martyr.This was also the year that music fans who’d previously filled their CD racks with white boys playing guitars began to embrace rap and hip-hop\u0026nbsp– and also when hip-hop transformed, Kafka-like, into something quite new.Then Notorious BIG\u0026nbspreleased his debut Ready to Die, and indeed he did, becoming the martyr of 1997 a few years later. Public Enemy brought out their highly acclaimed fifth studio album, Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age, and the Beastie Boys fused hip hop with the greatest 1970s police detective show that never was with the video to their single “Sabotage”.In Britain, this acceptance of rap into the music collections of the largely white indie-kid audience led to the birth of something else we can thank 1994 for: trip-hop.The term was coined that year by a Mixmag journalist to describe the bass-heavy fusion of hip-hop and dance music that was largely coming out of Bristol. Massive Attack had already released the seminal Blue Lines album and the evergreen “Unfinished Sympathy” in 1991, but this year saw their second album Protection, and its standout single release “Karmacoma”. But the year was most notable for Portishead’s debut, Dummy, drenched in blue and heartbreak, and the soundtrack to a thousand all-back-to-mine post-club chillouts.What else? Well, we could still get away with forgiving Morrissey a lot back in 1994, especially with his fourth solo album Vauxhall and I. The Manic Street Preachers released The Holy Bible, the last work to feature troubled lyricist and guitarist Richey Edwards. The following year he would go missing, never to be found, making a martyr of a more introspective kind than Cobain’s dramatic exit. The old-stagers were keeping on keeping on, with albums from Madonna and the Rolling Stones, and even a wealth of previously unheard Beatles material from their sessions at the BBC.But if there was one comeback that exemplified 1994, it had to be The Stone Roses. Their self-titled debut album in 1989 soundtracked a generation. Their return five years later had a lot riding on it in terms of expectations. So, of course, they titled it The Second Coming.Bill Gates basically predicted rise of Netflix and Facebook in 1994Read this full unedited Tom Petty interview published in 1994Was it ever going to be as good as The Stone Roses? No, of course not, because that album was perfection. But with singles such as “Love Spreads” and “Ten Storey Love Song”, they made a pretty good fist of it. But it was an event, it was exciting, it was history-making. And it was brave and reckless and so typically Stone Roses\u0026nbspto release their first new album for years when everyone had all but written them off, and especially to do that in the greatest year for music ever.Without the benefit of the internet or smartphones, we discovered new music in 1994, we heard it in the pubs and at gigs and in clubs and festivals and on John Peel’s radio show. We bought indie music then we went to Creamfields or to superclubs in places like Leeds, and danced until dawn.Techno got hard and heavy. The aforementioned Orbital released Snivilisation, a growling, science-fiction nightmare of an album. The government tried to kill off rave culture good and proper with the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which drove people into the clubs but also earned a response from the Prodigy in the form of Music for the Jilted Generation, a howling, psychopathic protest album that gifted us the insane energy of “No Good (Start the Dance)” and “Voodoo People”. The Chemical Brothers, under the name the Dust Brothers, started releasing singles. Dance music became raw and scary, a self-fulfilling prophecy for those in positions of authority that thought they simply had to ban it.Music in 1994 was a erse mess, just like it always is. But it seemed as if there was an invisible thread running through all these genres\u0026nbspthat connected people through a general love of music. You might love Oasis more than the Prodigy, or Blur more than Portishead, but the chances are you listened to all of it. The year was about invention, about reinvention, about throwing open the doors and just trying everything. It was involving and inclusive and seems to shine so very brightly from the vantage point of today.\u0026nbspThe obvious answer to all this is that I am just old and clinging on to a year that seemed glorious just because I was there. But I insist: 1994 was the best year ever for music, and its spirit is something we could sorely do with today.

It opposes the extremism of no-deal but is not prepared to support ‘no Brexit’. Its position is for soft Brexit, triangulating between the instruction to Leave and the economic concerns of those who voted to Remain.That means a permanent customs union, alignment with the single market, and compromise on freedom of movement. Jeremy Corbyn’s letter to the prime minister of 6th February set out Labour’s Brexit plan clearly and coherently. What is distinctive about Labour’s plan for Brexit is that it honours the vote to leave while maintaining a close partnership with the EU such that it is capable of securing the consent of those who voted to stay. It has more than fulfilled its responsibility as the Opposition. \u0026nbspThe Labour plan appears to be based on the IPPR paper ‘the Shared Market’, first published in December 2017, which I co-authored. In fact, its first outing was not to the Labour leadership but to David Davis and Steve Baker at the Department for Exiting the European Union.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe report introduced the idea that the crucial strategic decision was not about securing ‘access’ to the single market but rather whether there would be regulatory alignment or regulatory ergence. The report examined the various options for a new partnership, identifying a future relationship that could satisfy the concerns of both sides of the ide (and was briefly considered by senior cabinet figures).Labour’s position has, in fact, been much more defined for longer than is commonly imagined.It was in February last year that the Labour Leader adopted the central idea of “a new and comprehensive customs union” that would be permanent. A few months later a frontbench Labour amendment adopted another key component: alignment to the single market, based on shared institutions, such as a UK Court of Justice with multilateral membership.The Corbyn letter codified other elements too, including dynamic alignment on workers’ and consumer rights and environmental protections (meaning that regulations would adjust in the UK to match improvements in the single market over time). Mindful of the sovereignty concerns of Leave supporters, the report also argued that there must remain the possibility of ergence, albeit with known and proportionate consequences thus eliminating any ‘cakeism’.The Labour plan was infused with political life by positive reactions in Westminster and Brussels. The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said it could be a way to break the impasse. Senior Conservative backbenchers said that they would support key elements of the proposal.So we now know that there is a deal available that is acceptable to the EU and that could almost certainly command majority support in the House of Commons. But its passage would come at the price of splitting the Tory Party down the middle, on a scale and severity akin to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 (another dispute about international trade).Yet Mrs May has chosen to reject Labour’s proposal, placing the unity of the Conservative Party above the opportunity to unify the country with a form of Brexit that would have honoured the referendum result while protecting the economy.Labour strategists believe that attempting to stop Brexit would destroy the party’s chances of winning the next general election. They point out that the vast majority of Labour-Tory marginals voted to Leave, and that it is vital for the party to win these seats if it is to create an anti-Tory majority in the House of Commons. They believe that these voters would punish them for advocating for, let alone forcing, a second referendum. Some go further still, arguing that Labour would inevitably lead the Remain campaign\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspand that Leave would win once again, thus destroying the leadership of\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn.\u0026nbspThose representing working class constituencies in the north of England have vocally made the case that attempting to reverse Brexit would be a betrayal of Labour’s working class supporters. The reality is that for many of Labour’s working class supporters, Brexit is not particularly important, compared to the impact of austerity and stagnating living standards. This makes sense: any voter for whom leaving the EU was a top issue would be unlikely to support Labour anyhow.Nonetheless, the nostalgic, romantic idea of championing the working classes has strong emotional resonance at the top of the party. Shadow ministers such as Ian Lavery, Richard Burgon, Jon Trickett, and Andrew Gwynne are reported to have threatened to resign rather than to vote in favour of a second referendum. So for the Labour leadership so far, a second referendum has been a paper option, not a serious way forward.Moreover, this electoral strategy chimes with the long-held ideological position of key decision makers, many of whom have been opposed to the EU for decades. It is variously seen as an undemocratic, neoliberal institution, asserting neo-colonial control over its weaker members, and as an instrument of NATO. That’s why Jeremy Corbyn opposes Tory Brexit, but does not oppose Brexit itself.From this standpoint, accepting the result of the referendum is not sacrificing the national interest to the party interest they are inisible. Confirmation bias is surely at play: the electoral strategy that is seen as most promising is also the one that confirms the pre-existing ideological position.Created with Sketch.

This was illustrated by the absence of consequences for those Labour MPs that rebelled on the Cooper-Boles amendment to legislate to prevent no-deal.This strategy stands a reasonable chance of success: the real die-hards in the Conservative Party that oppose any deal number perhaps 30 MPs should roughly 15 Labour MPs support the government and roughly 30 abstain, then the deal will pass. But is this really smart politics? Or a high stakes gamble based on flawed assumptions?First, the strategy is based on the assumption that British politics will ‘move on’ from Brexit after the deal is approved by parliament and refocus on domestic policy instead. Labour wisely realises that politics is not about two competing answers to the same question but what question is being answered in the first place: if Brexit is the question of a general election, then the Tories will be the answer.But if the election is about the state of the country, Labour believes it is poised to win. At the 2017 general election, many voters appeared to think that Brexit and immigration had been ‘dealt with’ and the national conversation shifted to stagnant wages, increasing class sizes and longer waiting times in the NHS.In the Brexit poker game no one has a decent handBut this is wishful thinking. Brexit won’t disappear as a political issue: come the end of 2020, parliament will need to either ratify a FTA with the EU, extend the transition at the cost of £11byear, or enter the hated backstop. The most likely outcome is a transition that extend to April 2022, the month prior to the general election in May 2022. That feels like an eternity away—and in political terms it is. If the Brexit project succeeds—or more accurately, it does not catastrophically fail—the government will reap the political benefits. But if it fails, expect the blame to be spread liberally around. Neither is it wise to assume opinion will remain static. The longer the Brexit shambles persists, the higher the chance that Labour votes shift from disquiet to disillusion with their leader’s seeming ambivalence. \u0026nbspSecond, the strategy assumes that the next general election will be determined by swing voters in marginal seats. This approach privileges the views of Labour and Tory Leave supporters rather than Remainers. But it is hard to picture Tory-voting Leave supporters switching to Labour under Corbyn’s leadership, not least because these voters are more likely to be concerned about issues such as national security which are traditional ‘owned’ by the Conservatives. It is hard to believe that the same people who can energise the left with a clear socialist message can also persuade Brexit supporting Tory voters to switch allegiances. More than that, as New Labour discovered to its peril, it is dangerous to take your own supporters for granted.But what if the election isn’t determined by swing voters at all?One of the important consequences of the 2016 referendum was to ide the country in two blocs that have coalesced into competing identities as well as political positions. Is the UK perhaps becoming a 50-50 nation? This is the phenomenon seen in the US since the 1990s – where the country is split into two competing cultural and geographic blocs – and may provide some explanation for the resurgence in support for the two major parties in the 2017 general election.In such a scenario, what matters is not swing voters but energising your base to get out and vote – and not sufficiently riling your opponents’ supporters so they feel the need to stop you (witness Labour’s commitment to the pensions triple lock in 2017, for example).\u0026nbspLabour strategists have argued that Remainers have nowhere else to go, and that if there was really popular support for a stop Brexit party, then the Liberal Democrats would have been beneficiaries by now. The mooted “Neoliberal Democrat”\u0026nbspparty that is likely to be formed by a small number of Labour MPs splitting to join with the Lib Dems will attract copious media coverage, but has next to no constituency in the country.But this is to miss the point: the real risk for Labour is not that its Remain voters support other parties, but that they simply stay at home and don’t vote for anyone. So if the next general election is determined by turnout rather than by swing voters, Labour could be in serious trouble. Labour is betting that these voters are to be found in city seats with already large majorities, and so the impact would be negligible. But what if they are in marginals, in places like Kensington or Canterbury?Team Corbyn believe that their base is not energised by EU membership, but by ending austerity, investing in public services, and promoting economic justice. That is certainly true for vocal Labour supporters for whom the project is about socialism, not the details of the UK’s relationship with the single market or European institutions.Brexit: How austerity convinced residents to vote LeaveBut for other middle-class voters – insulated from the severest impacts of austerity but for whom the EU is an important identity issue – there is a risk that this is not the case. And Labour’s ask to the middle classes for more redistribution means that motivation really matters in getting them out to vote. Labour may discover\u0026nbspvoters find it rather easy to stay at home when asked to vote for higher taxes on themselves. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThird, Labour’s triangulated position risks undermining one of the most important dimensions of Corbyn’s popular appeal. Despite being in parliament for more than 30 years, Corbyn was able to position Labour as the party of change precisely because he was rightly perceived to be an outsider, and unlike career politicians. The message of his leadership campaign – “straight talking, honest politics” – was the same positioning used in the 2017 general election.But by triangulating on Brexit, Corbyn runs the risk of being seen to be just like any other politician. This probably explains the decline in his approval ratings to historic lows—indeed, Corbyn might be better perceived if he simply picked a side, whether that was Leave or Remain.The shift in perception of Corbyn towards being seen as any other politician will make it much harder for Labour to be seen as the party that can bring about the change Britain needs at the next general election, particularly since the Tories will have elected a new leader by that time. Again, this risks turnout of Labour voters rather than affecting swing voters. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat’s the alternative?The only way out our Brexit malaise? Labour winning a general electionThe alternative for Labour is to stick to the spirit as well as the letter of its Brexit policy agreed at its party conference in September. That would mean continuing to oppose May’s Brexit deal as bad for the country and for no-deal to be taken off the table. If Labour’s Brexit plan is rejected by parliament, then the party should fight for the people to be given the final say. \u0026nbspIt must mobilise its 500,000 members to campaign for the people to be given the final say on the deal—whether to keep the deal we already have as members (in the EU but out of the euro and Schengen) or to embrace the deal proposed by the prime minister. If the prime minister believes so strongly in her deal, why not put it to the people?If Labour MPs are presented with a choice between May’s Withdrawal Agreement—including its hard Brexit destination for the future relationship—and a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister will win the vote. The prime minister knows this and the public do too.As it stands, Labour is already seen by a majority of the public as the “party of Remain”. Brexit was always a project of the right and it is now rightly owned by the Tory party. Given this, voters might well reward the party for a clear, forceful, and unambiguous position – regardless of whether the parliamentary numbers for a further referendum materialise or not. Labour does not have the votes in parliament to end austerity, but that has not stopped it from campaigning against it. Why should Brexit be different? A public vote can only happen if it commands cross-party support, so if Labour is unable to force it to happen, it will not shoulder the responsibility. But if it doesn’t even try, then it will surely share in the public’s opprobrium.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentIn many respects, Labour is in the classic dilemma of strategy under uncertainty. For all the claims and counterclaims of each side, the truth is that no one can be sure, not least because Labour possesses the capacity to shape events as well as respond to them. The polling evidence is mixed and often contradictory—a majority of the public don’t want a second referendum but then again Labour support also appears to suffer significantly if the party is seen to back Brexit.No one should pretend Labour faces an easy path ahead. But situations of extreme uncertainty also have their blessings: if the politically shrewd course is unclear, then all the more reason to simply do the right thing for the future prosperity and security of the country, and oppose Brexit. \u0026nbspLeaving the EU is bad for Britain it is a project of the radical right that has been revealed to have been both deceitful and empty at the same time. Labour should oppose it.Centuries of foreign policy sought to prevent the European continent uniting against this country through our own volition, the UK has finally brought about precisely the outcome it has always sought to avoid.Since its creation, the United Kingdom has been torn between wishing to engage in European affairs and to retreat to its shores, and Brexit must be understood in that context. So it is a very serious mistake to believe that there can be political stability outside the EU: no equilibrium position can be reached precisely because the UK economy will continue to be shaped by decisions made in Brussels. No matter the deal, Brexit means the UK giving up its participation in decision-making and losing the very control the referendum sought to restore.That’s why, in time, the UK will re-join, albeit on less favourable terms than we enjoy today. And so the left of British politics will surely search for internationalist leadership in the decade ahead. No matter how much the public demand “just get on with it”, the Europe question is here to stay.\u0026nbspLabour must fight for Britain to shape our future for the better, as full members of the European Union.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTom Kibasi writes in a personal capacity.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Sir Antony Gormley sculpture was installed in 1998, with celebrations marking its 20th birthday this yearWe\u0027re planning a full evaluation of the partnerships later this year. Like the review, we believe in strong local journalism and have been looking at how best to develop the work we have begun with the industry and will have more to say in the near future, a spokesperson said.However, there is no evidence of the BBC crowding out other providers. This was looked at extensively during Charter review. It\u0027s vital that people of all ages have access to impartial news which is relevant to them, and we provide younger audiences with a wide range of stories.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re happy to look at what more we can do to share our technical and digital expertise for the benefit of local publishers, but as the review itself says, any curtailing of the BBC\u0027s news offer would be counter-productive.Representing national, regional and local news organisations, the News Media Association (NMA) said it wanted to work with ministers to take forward the recommendations of the review as a matter of urgency.This is a thoughtful report which recognises the critical role of written journalism to democracy and sets out a series of detailed recommendations, many of which respond directly to the proposals put forward by the NMA and our members, it said in a statement.These include a Competition and Markets Authority market study into the \u0027complex and opaque\u0027 online advertising market, new measures aimed at constraining the behaviour of the online platforms, an examination of the BBC\u0027s impact on commercial publishers, funding support for local news publishers, and tax reliefs such as extending VAT zero rating for online news publications.We look forward to engaging with the government to discuss the Cairncross recommendations in more detail and how these should be taken forward as a matter of urgency to ensure they support independent journalism delivered by a strong and sustainable press.The Society of Editors (SoE) welcomed the review\u0027s support for the reporting of local democracy –\u0026nbspincluding the expansion of the BBC local news partnerships –\u0026nbspbut said it was essential the press remained free from political interference.It is extremely gratifying that Dame Frances and her panel have underscored the need to protect and indeed reinvigorate the reporting of local democracy and open justice, areas which have suffered and continue to suffer as the industry contracts, its executive director, Ian Murray, said.Crucial to all of the recommendations for what is really state support for the local media industry in particular, are the report\u0027s insistence that bodies such as the proposed institution are free from political and other interference in deciding what constitutes public interest news worth supporting.”Additional reporting from agencies\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You can’t really run in it, it’ll literally fly off. The pins come out and it falls off – it’s not comfortable.“Wearing the sports hijab makes it ten times easier, and I genuinely think it’s a lifesaver.”Some sports giants already have their own hijabs on the market, however at £15 Brunel’s is about 40 per cent cheaper than the one Nike launched in 2017.The hijab will initially only be available in “Brunel blue” and in two sizes but it is hoped there will be a wider range of colours if it takes off.Scrap GCSEs and focus on skills for ‘digital age’, senior MP saysSheffield student investigated after offensive messages about womenMinisters reject calls to ease ‘pointlessly cruel’ benefit sanctionsTurkey calls on China to close Muslim \u0027concentration camps\u0027 Ranjeet Rathore, president of the Union of Brunel Students, has been a driving force behind the hijab.“When we narrowed it down, we found the main gap to be in BAME female sports participation – specifically, we found there to be a barrier to Muslim women taking part in team sport,” he said.“Of course, they were participating in sports on their own and in private, but they weren’t really going out to competitions, or using sport as a social tool to get involved in activities.“There are now other unis that want to partner with us, who want to take samples off us, who want to do their own hijab – which is great news.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brussels\u0026nbsphas insisted that\u0026nbspit will not reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspmeaning no changes to the controversial Irish\u0026nbspbackstop.On Tuesday, Ms May will have to ask MPs for more time to secure the changes she is seeking.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe\u0026nbspfurther delay has renewed speculation that this is a deliberate ploy, with Labour accusing the prime minister of “cynically” running down the clock.Some opponents claim that her strategy is to waste time and then\u0026nbspforce MPs to vote on her deal when it is too late to find any alternative.Move your Brexit red lines, Labour and EU both tell Theresa MayIn theory she could return to the Commons late in March –\u0026nbspjust days before the 29 March exit date –\u0026nbspand claim parliament has only two choices: back her deal\u0026nbspor leave the EU without an agreement.\u0026nbspMs May\u0026nbsphas already pushed back key votes on her Brexit deal, fuelling claims\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspshe is playing for time.First she delayed the “meaningful vote” on her\u0026nbspwithdrawal agreement\u0026nbspby more than\u0026nbspa month. Originally due to take place on 11 December, it was eventually held on 15 January.When the deal was rejected by an unprecedented\u0026nbsp230 votes, many people expected the prime minister to change strategy and pivot towards a softer Brexit, a no-deal outcome or some form of public vote.That has not happened. Instead, she\u0026nbsphas insisted she can secure the concessions from the EU that she believes she needs\u0026nbspto win parliament’s support for her deal, despite Brussels giving no indication\u0026nbspthat it is willing to budge.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentMore delays seem to be on the horizon. Last month, Ms May promised that she would either give MPs a vote on a revised deal\u0026nbspby 13 February or, if she had not been able to secure further changes, on an amendable motion updating the Commons on her negotiations.With no alternative deal\u0026nbspin sight, MPs will only\u0026nbspvote this week on the government’s update,\u0026nbspwhich is likely to say that more time is needed\u0026nbspto secure changes to the agreement.Ministers have floated\u0026nbspthe prospect of a similar vote being held on 27\u0026nbspFebruary, meaning a second vote on the deal itself\u0026nbspis unlikely to happen before the end of February at the earliest. Even if a deal is then approved, it would leave just a month for parliament to pass all the legislation needed to enact Brexit.Video shows Jeremy Corbyn vowing to ‘defeat’ the EUFood industry threatens to end cooperation over no-deal riskCorbyn ‘cut second referendum line from letter to May’‘Take a breath’ and admit UK not ready for Brexit, Tory MPs tell MayAn EU summit scheduled for 22 March –\u0026nbspless than a week before Brexit day –\u0026nbspcould give Ms May justification for further delays, if she argues that this is when the EU will finally offer new concessions.\u0026nbspEven if no concessions were forthcoming, some people\u0026nbspbelieve that, faced with the threat of a no-deal Brexit in a matter of days, MPs would reluctantly\u0026nbspagree to support the prime minister’s plan (even if it is fundamentally unchanged from the one rejected in January).\u0026nbspBut any strategy involving running down the clock is highly risky, not least because it\u0026nbsprelies on parliament agreeing not to intervene in the coming weeks. Last month, Labour’s Yvette Cooper tabled an amendment that would have delayed Brexit until the end of the year if no deal was in place by the end of February.That motion was rejected by a margin of 23 votes, but as Brexit edges closer and the prospect of no deal becomes ever more likely, MPs might be swayed into backing another, similar\u0026nbspamendment.\u0026nbspThe Labour leadership is also seeking to torpedo Ms May’s ability to waste time. Jeremy Corbyn has written to the prime minister offering talks on a cross-party compromise deal, and will this week table an amendment that would force her to hold a second vote on her Brexit deal –\u0026nbsprevised or not –\u0026nbspby 26 February.No one other than Ms May and her closest advisers knows whether\u0026nbspshe is deliberately running down the clock.\u0026nbspBut the continual delays and her refusal to consider an extension to Article 50 do little to quash claims that this is her plan.Even if it is\u0026nbspnot, the fact remains that the 29 March Brexit date is enshrined in law and the UK is speeding towards it without a deal in sight.

He will have dinner with Mr Barnier and try to convince him of the need for changes to the Irish backstop – which the EU has flat-out refused to countenance.But Mr Barnier said: “Tonight I will repeat the EU’s positions. I will listen to what the secretary of state has to tell us concerning the alternative arrangements which the UK would like“But it’s not more than a concept today. I will also evaluate the interest from the UK side for possible changes to the political declaration, which, let me remind you, fixes the outline quite precisely for the future separation.”David Lidington, Ms May’s Cabinet Brexit fixer, is also in the EU capital for meetings, and he and Mr Barclay will go to Strasbourg on Tuesday for meetings with MEPs.Speaking ahead of a meeting with the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney on Monday, Mr Starmer told reporters: “We will have to see what happens next, but the point of the exercise is to say there is a majority for a close economic relationship if you are prepared to try to find it, and I said we should test that by having a vote on the customs union.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliament“The Labour Party has some concerns about the backstop but we absolutely accept that it’s inevitable that we need a backstop. At this stage of the exercise the Article 50 window is almost being closed now so we need a backstop.“The letter was an agreed letter that was sent out. The critical question is: is she, in her response, indicating a willingness to drop her red lines or not? And that’s what needs to be tested sooner rather than later.”Following the meeting between Mr Barclay and Mr Barnier, a UK government spokesperson said: “Secretary of State for the Department for Exiting the European Union Stephen Barclay and Michel Barnier followed up on last week\u0027s meeting between the Prime Minister and President of the European Commission Juncker to discuss the next steps in the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and explore whether a way through can be found that would be acceptable to the UK Parliament and to the European Union.\u0026nbspThe meeting was constructive and Mr Barclay and Mr Barnier agreed to further talks in the coming days and that their teams would continue to work in the meantime on finding a way forward.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Former party chair Grant Shapps, a critic of the prime minister from the party’s liberal wing, said on Monday that there was “no point winning Labour MPs, by losing Tories”.But a second referendum would still not be certain with support from the Labour leadership – as a number of Labour MPs have said they would not vote for one in any circumstances, and only around a dozen Tory MPs have said they would support one.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Sir Antony Gormley sculpture was installed in 1998, with celebrations marking its 20th birthday this yearThe government accepted a recommendation to evaluate the effectiveness of reforms to welfare conditionality and sanctions, and said it would focus its evaluation on whether the sanctions regime within universal credit was effective at supporting claimants to search for work.\u0026nbspBut the committee said that while this was “clearly key”, the government was still not even considering the impact of sanctions on claimants’ financial and personal wellbeing.A 2012 law dramatically stepped up the sanctions regime inherited from Labour, making the penalties “longer, more severe and applicable to more people than ever before”, the MPs’ report said.If conditions are not met, benefits are docked for four weeks, which can mean a loss of £300 for a claimant over the age of 25 – but a sanction can last for three months, or even a year.The report last year found that the negative impact of sanctions actually stymied claiments’ efforts to find work, to the extent that the government’s approach appeared “arbitrarily punitive”.\u0026nbspThe MPs said the evidence they received was “more compelling than that against the imposition of conditionality and sanctions on people with a disability or health condition. It does not work. Worse, it is harmful and counterproductive.”Ministers broke pledge to review ‘pointlessly cruel‘ benefit sanctionsNo evidence that benefit sanctions work, finds secret DWP reportBenefit sanctions ‘increase poverty and push people into crime’Independent MP Frank Field, the chairman of the committee,\u0026nbspaccused the government on Monday of “failing utterly to grasp the seriousness of the matter” in its response to their concerns.He said: “Our report laid bare the inhumanity of the government’s sanctions regime, which it has pursued for years without ever stopping to check whether it works or what it is doing to the people it is meant to ‘support’.\u0026nbsp“It talks about reviews and ‘proof of concept’.\u0026nbspIt might want to take a look at the concept of not pushing disabled people and single parents – not to mention their children – into grinding poverty and hardship.”It comes after the government was accused of “sneaking out” a report which found there was\u0026nbsp“no evidence” that benefit sanctions encourage claimants to get into work or increase their earnings.The report, published with no ministerial announcement in September, showed\u0026nbspdocking benefits as a punishment for alleged failures to comply with Jobcentre Plus rules did not encourage claimants to apply for additional work, and in some cases “damaged\u0026nbspthe relationship between the work coach and the claimant”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, consumer confidence has started to come under pressure with British households £1,500 worse off on average than was forecast before the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.Households had been supplementing meagre earnings growth by increasing their levels of debt, but consumer credit growth dropped in December.The Bank of England reported\u0026nbspthe annual growth of unsecured lending in the month fell to 6.6 per cent, down from 7.2 per cent in November.This was the weakest figure since December 2014. Credit card lending growth slowed to 7.1 per cent, down from 7.9 per cent the previous month.A number of economists precisted the slowdown would continue into 2019 unless the government could deliver a degree of certainty about\u0026nbspthe UK’s trading relationship with the EU.Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said Brexit ucertainty and slowing global growth were “suffocating” economic\u0026nbspactivity.\u0026nbspHe added: “The continued decline in business investment is a blackspot for the economy as it undermines the UK’s ability to raise productivity and increase our long-term growth prospects.“It is increasingly likely that the slowdown at the end of 2018 will persist as continued Brexit uncertainty and the raised possibility of a no-deal exit from the EU weigh heavily on UK’s growth prospects. Firms are increasingly reporting having to ert staff, money and investment to protect against the chaos of a no-deal Brexit.”Paul Dales, chief UK economist\u0026nbspat Capital Economics, said the ONS figures support the more downbeat view given by the Bank of England last week.“But they also suggest there is plenty of scope for the economy to bounce back once the Brexit uncertainty is removed,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We\u0027ve never seen something like this orbiting the Sun.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe new images offer a different perspective on the object, which is floating in the Kuiper Belt on the edge of our solar system. As such, they show that the round object isn\u0027t so round at all – when looked at from another view, it is almost flat, which scientists did not expect.After the first images, scientists nicknamed Ultima Thule the snowman, because it seemed to resembles two spheres stacked on top of each other.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

The bigger part is like a giant pancake and the smaller one is like a dented walnut, the scientists say.We had an impression of Ultima Thule based on the limited number of images returned in the days around the flyby, but seeing more data has significantly changed our view, Stern said. It would be closer to reality to say Ultima Thule\u0027s shape is flatter, like a pancake. But more importantly, the new images are creating scientific puzzles about how such an object could even be formed. We\u0027ve never seen something like this orbiting the Sun.The images aren\u0027t the last to be captured or sent by New Horizons, which began its work on Ultima Thule after exploring Pluto. But they are the last views thatit captured as it raced away after its New Years flyby, travelling past at 31,000 miles per hour.The images were snapped just 10 minutes after New Horizons passed by its closest approach to the distant object.This really is an incredible image sequence, taken by a spacecraft exploring a small world four billion miles away from Earth, said Stern. Nothing quite like this has ever been captured in imagery.Much of the scientific data being collected is being used to understand how small planets might have formed in the early solar system. But the shocking and strange shape of Ultima Thule could change that understanding fundamentally, scientists say.While the very nature of a fast flyby in some ways limits how well we can determine the true shape of Ultima Thule, the new results clearly show that Ultima and Thule are much flatter than originally believed, and much flatter than expected, added Hal Weaver, New Horizons project scientist from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. This will undoubtedly motivate new theories of planetesimal formation in the early solar system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It says “the far right and right-wing Eurosceptics will, if current polling is accurate, rise from 23 per cent to 28 per cent” with this potentially rising to around 30 per cent once the campaign is underway.“They could even gain more than 30 per cent of seats if their popularity continues to grow or if some of the fringe members of the mainstream join them. If they cross the one-third threshold, this would signify a qualitative change in the EU,” the report adds.In certain policy areas, dissent from the mainstream by the eurosceptic far-left – such as on trade, sanctions, and foreign policy – could also make passing legislation difficult.\u0026nbspThough the assorted eurosceptic parties across the continent have struggled to form a coherent alliance, when it comes to votes in parliament they have often voted in a similar direction. Despite being spread across disparate political groups, most populist forces voted against sanctions against Hungary in a crunch vote last year.There are also increasing moves to try to unite the groups – such as the plan for an “anti-immigration axis” proposed by Italy’s de facto leader Matteo Salvini. Far-right US figure Steve Bannon has also unveiled plans to unite the groups, though it is unclear whether he will be successful.\u0026nbspParliament isn’t perfect – in Brussels or Westminster“The warning in this report, that anti-European parties are gaining strength and could paralyse the EU, should concentrate the minds of pro-Europeans,” said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.“They must not become trapped into becoming defenders of the status quo in Europe or allowing the election to become a referendum on the issue of migration – which is exactly the battleground that the anti-Europeans want.“Instead, pro-Europeans need to unmute the silent majority by fighting different elections that Europe’s different publics will vote on – such as the climate change election, the ‘Facebook’ election for those concerned for their data and privacy, the election for those worried about Russian aggression, the prosperity election for those worried about stalled living standards, the rule of law election for those worried about democratic backsliding, and the ‘saving Europe’ election for the EU’s most ardent defenders.”\u0026nbspThe European Parliament elections are scheduled for 23-26 May. The UK is not scheduled to take part as it is on course to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Russia was strong, he argued, only because it had rejected western notions and democratic institutions. Such institutions\u0026nbsponly\u0026nbspgave\u0026nbspan “illusion of choice”, and were inferior to Russia’s wise\u0026nbspleader, who was\u0026nbspable to “listen, understand and see” his\u0026nbsppeople.“The modern model of Russian statehood begins on trust and rests on trust,” he said. “This is its major distinction to the western model, which cultivates distrust and criticism. And herein lies its\u0026nbspstrength.” \u0026nbspWriting on Facebook, the political commentator Abbas Gallyamov\u0026nbspnoted wryly that Mr Surkov’s idea of trust appeared at\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsptime of\u0026nbsppolls registering historically low levels of trust in\u0026nbspthe leadership.Putin heralds successful tests of new hypersonic nuclear weaponsStep up Vladimir Putin, president of Belarus? Putin: Russia will develop intermediate-range missiles if US doesMr Surkov spared little praise of his boss.\u0026nbspIn time, Putin’s Russia would be recognised Russia’s fourth great “model of state-building”, he said – and on a par with the efforts of Ivan the Great in the 15th century, Peter the Great in the 18th century, and Vladimir Lenin in the 20th century.\u0026nbspPutin’s system was also ripe for export, Mr Surkov\u0026nbspadded. Foreign governments were already paying close attention, since the\u0026nbspRussian “political algorithm” had long predicted\u0026nbspthe volatility now seen in western democracies.\u0026nbsp“Russia is playing with the west’s minds,” he writes. “They don’t know how to deal with their own changed consciousness.” \u0026nbspDuring his peak in the 2000s,\u0026nbspMr Surkov cultivated an image of being an all-powerful operator, expertly recruiting and co-opting all strands of ideology political opinion. But his ambitions always went further than being an operator. He saw himself as the beating intellectual heart of the regime.\u0026nbspMr Surkov, while still an influential player, is no longer at the heart of the Kremlin policy machine.\u0026nbspHe fell out of favour with Vladimir Putin\u0026nbspafter appearing to side with Dmitry Medvedev in the tempestuous protest years of 2008-2012, and\u0026nbspwas unceremoniously dropped in favour of rival Vyacheslav Volodin.\u0026nbspSince then, Mr Surkov is believed to have taken charge of the Kremlin’s secret campaign in eastern Ukraine, has acted as Russia’s point of contact in the Minsk peace negotiations, and\u0026nbsphas taken to penning lofty\u0026nbspessays about the state of Russia.\u0026nbspPresidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said\u0026nbspMr Surkov’s “complex”, “interesting” and “deep” article had been neither approved or seen\u0026nbspby the president.

There’s so much he’s got to give! He’s completely positive!In footage from , the then anonymous backbench MP from the People’s Republic of Islington ­lambasts “the European empire” and mocks Brussels for wanting referendums re-run until they produce the “correct” result.Oh, Jeremy Corbyn!I bet all the middle-class kiddies who worshipped at your sandals-and-socks combo at Glastonbury never saw this coming.The footage of Corbyn dissing Brussels to an Irish audience is so incendiary it makes Liam Neeson look as though he chooses his words carefully.Comrade Corbyn really, really could not be clearer about his true feelings.“We are creating here one massive great Frankenstein which will damage all of us in the long run,” he says of the EU.“If you succeed in getting a No vote herethat will be such a boost to people like us, all over Europe, who do not want to live in a European empire of the st century.”You tell ’em, Boris! I mean, Jeremy!After being forced out of the Brexit closet, JC can no longer cynically have it both ways — playing a Remainer to the middle class and a Leaver to the working class. That hypocritical ploy to squeeze into  Downing Street will no longer fly.It is a dead ploy. That ploy is extinct. It is no more.On the great issue of our time, the old boy just got shoved right off the fence. And fell on his face.Donald Tusk, Brussels’ head bully boy, digressed from condemning .million Brits to hell for voting Leave to sneer that there is a “leadership void” in the Remain camp. He means YOU, Jeremy.Tusk has seen right through two-faced Corbyn, evenall the little Marxist morons who chant his name are only just waking up to the cruel truth. Corbyn deserves to be despised by both sides of the debate.He placed the prospect of power above his principles. And we still don’t really know how he voted in the Referendum — although we can make an educated guess.The irony is that Jeremy Corbyn could have been a true hero to the working-class men and women who have voted Labour for a letime and then voted in their millions to leave the EU.Corbyn could have spoken for those men and women and stood up for them when the sneering elite dismissed them as thick, racist bigots too stupid to have a valid opinion.It was Tony Benn, Corbyn’s great hero, and the most eloquent opponent of the European Union in our nation’s history, who famously said he felt like “a slave to Rome” when he went to Brussels.Tony Benn would have had the courage to advocate Brexit and ­Corbyn must know it.Jeremy will be a tiny footnote in our nation’s history but what a crying shame that, in our country’s time of need, the Labour Party could not produce a leader who would represent the millions of working-class men and women who have learned to despise the EU.Corbyn tried to play it smart — and still does — by endlessly parroting that “everything is on the table” and never truly engaging with the debate that has come close to tearing this country apart.And now he has been caught out because Corbyn, always more Mickey Mouse than Machiavelli, was never clever enough to play this duplicitous game.The EU is revealing its true nature — a bullying empire that has no interest in being a partner, friend or ally of the Britishwe eventually manage to leave.The EU wants to see us on our knees.The EU wants to see us suffer for refusing to be their obedient colony.The EU wants us to pay such a high price for leaving that the remaining countries will be too timid to dream of le beyond this democracy-despising empire.All we can do is oppose these arrogant, unelected bullies. All we can do is demand our independence — no matter the dark warnings, no matter the sneering, no matter the threat of punishment beatings.What a tragedy for Labour that their leader never had the guts to join this nation’s fight for independence.ELLE MACPHERSON has revealed her simple guide for looking drop dead gorgeous.Most of Elle’s tips are eminently doable for any of us – eat your evening meal early , get fresh air every day, have some calming tea before bedtime and,sleep doesn’t come, put your feet up for five minutes.Only one of The Body’s tips is more dficult to arrange – Elle suggests regular relaxation in a sauna or steam room – but most of her guidelines for healthy radiance are simple common sense.But she has missed the most important tip of all.Be born beautul.Don’t forget that one, Elle!THE Tories are very keen on “autonomous” vehicles – driverless cars with no steering wheels and “no human oversight” – and hope that they will be zipping about on our roads within two years.Automotive minister Richard Harrington says: “We need to ensure we take the public with us as we move towards having self-driving cars on our roads by .”But I remember when a Labour government swore to us that diesel cars were the bright, shining future.In , Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced tax changes to petrol-fuelled cars that led to a massive increase in idiots like me buying diesel cars.The thinking was that diesel would help the environment because diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide than petrol engines.Unfortunately, diesel also produces far more pollutants and poisons, resulting in around , deaths every year.Whoops.I now have an elderly diesel car sitting on the drive that everyone hates.My excuse is that Gordon Brown told me I was saving the planet.Nobody wants diesel today. That is why Japanese car- maker Nissan will not be building its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. Brexit doesn’t come into it.These days driving a diesel is considered to be slightly less healthy than smoking crack. And the Tory “dash to driverless” is as muddle-headed as the Labour “dash to diesel” when Gordon Brown was in his pomp.Driverless cars – what could possibly go wrong WHEN Prince Charles met the Spice Girls in , the Prince of Wales clearly towered above the then Geri Halliwell.Reunited this week, they now appear to be the same height.Has the former Ginger Spice grown over the last  years Or is our future king shrinking  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You’re an anarchic shambles, without any discipline.His hardline views, formed more than four decades ago, reportedly positions which are much more extreme than current Labour policy.Mr Corbyn believes any controls on immigration are intrinsically racist and supports fully open borders, according to the book.Mr Bower also claims the Labour chief has never abandoned his lelong opposition to Britains EU membership.Although he publicly backed Remain, the biography says Mr Corbyn found regular excuses not to campaign properly.He was seen laughing with his allies the morning after Leave won the vote - but denied that hed secretly voted for Brexit.The party leaders close allies John McDonnell and Seamus Milne both voted for Leave, according to Mr Bower.When Mr Corbyn took over the party in , allies expressed concern that he was too nice to force through the hard-left agenda.But he apparently told Ken Livingstone: John McDonnell will do all the scary stuff.The telly star has apparently teamed up with JK Rowlings agent to try and set up a new political movement.The efforts are being led by two former Blair aides who believe Mr Corbyn has made Labour unelectable.And superstar author Ms Rowling has been suggested as a possible leader of the new party.Ms Riley and Eastenders actress Tracy Ann Oberman were among the guests at an event to discuss the new movement last week, the Mail on Sunday reported.Jonathan Powell and Phil Collins, who both worked for Tony Blair in No, hosted the party at the office of Ms Rowlings agent Neil Blair.They said they want the new political grouping to be launched later this year.Guests cheered when one member of the crowd said Ms Rowling should take charge because of her high public profile.The book also accuses Mr Corbyn of inspiring attacks on Jewish MPs whove spoken out against the partys anti-Semitism scandal, and using bullyboy tactics to inspire support.The MPs political obsession is so intense that it repeatedly took priority over the wellbeing of his family, Mr Bower says,He reportedly called Mr Veness to talk about Northern Ireland policy - as his second we Claudia was giving birth.His friend blasted: Haven’t you got something more serious to worry about  You’re about to be a father!But there was one moment when his principles did take a backseat - when he was invited to dinner with Fidel Castro.Despite being a devoted vegetarian, he happily ate beef when it was offered to him by the Cuban dictator.Tory chairman Brandon Lewis told the Mail on Sunday: What Corbyn has done to his own party is shameful, what he would do to our country would be a tragedy.

But it strikes a powerful chord with real people, particularly voters in the North.They resent claims they are racist thickos and believe all parties lied to them in  when they promised to deliver on the referendum, whatever the outcome.Like the BBC — and, indeed, the EU itself — Remainers are slow to realise time is running out. Brexit is to the EU what Netflix is to the BBC. The £billion licence fee — like the European “Grand Project” — is on its way out.Whatever last-minute deal Theresa May brings home, the scepticism which brought Brexit to le cannot simply be turned off.It is a disruptive force and is already beginning to sweep away the EU as we know it.Economist Bernard Connolly famously identied this as the logical consequence of EU skulduggery in his book The Rotten Heart Of Europe: The Dirty War For Europe’s Money.Connolly was in charge of setting up the euro, the slow-burning catastrophe which has wrecked economies and young lives across the EU.He was sacked for exposing the secretive abuse of power at the very top, exposing the unscrupulous methods deployed by an unaccountable regime to bludgeon critics into submission.The same tactics are used on rebellious nations like Britain today and Greece in , triggering the explosion of anger we are seeing among protesting citizens and a rise of authoritarianism against such dissent.EU states are at each other’s throats — Italy against France, Brussels against Hungary and Poland.The rise of military-style policing — French police firing hard rubber bullets at unarmed yellow-jacket protestors, the jailing of dissident politicians in Catalonia — is alarming.Romania, a former Soviet police state, is reverting to type and spying on its own citizens.Hungary locks up opponents and silences the media.The EU does nothing, fearing for its own survival.Europe-wide polls reveal increasing antagonism to Brussels, deeper even than here in the UK.He remains a cherished champion of free speech and razor-sharp inquisitorial combat.Mean-spirited as ever, the left-wingcould not resist suggesting he was past his sell-by date.Not by such a margin as this preachy, unpopular rag which is about to go out of print.Those politicians who believe we mustto the EU’s totalitarian embrace are grievously out of step.Yes, Brexit has been botched, both by Theresa May and by Brexiteers themselves. There may be trouble ahead.But those who voted in their millions in  to leave have not budged.

They walked in to find a naked woman on the bed.One of the visitors recalled: “There on the mattress on the floor in the one room is Diane with the duvet up to her neck, saying, ‘What the ****’s going on ’ We were quite shaken.” As Abbott tried to protect her modesty, Corbyn announced she was his new girlfriend.The source continued: “It was the late Seventies, it was still a point of interest, a white man with a black woman, so he was slightly showing off – ‘I’ve got a new girlfriend, and she’s black’.”At the time Abbott was working at the National Council for Civil Liberties.When colleagues went through her desk they found an eyebrow-raising sexual fantasy scrawled in her diary. In it she described being man- handled by her lover Corbyn – “a bearded Fenian and NUPE national organiser”.The loved-up pair went on a motorbike tour of East Germany, while Abbott has described her “finest half-hour” as romping in a Cotswold field with a mystery man, believed to be Corbyn.Author Bower claims the relationship broke down because Abbott wanted children but he did not.On one occasion, according to the new book, the family was invited to spend a week at a friend’s country home in Derbyshire, but Corbyn failed to show.For  hours, Claudia called around trying to track him down.He eventually arrived two days later, vaguely explaining his absence as a necessary sacrice for “the movement”.Even when Claudia was in hospital about to give birth to their first child in , Corbyn was more concerned with local leafletting.He was running for re-election at the time, and phoned constituency agent Keith Veness from outside the delivery room with an important update.Corbyn announced: “I’m really worried — we haven’t put out that leaflet about Northern Ireland.”His friend replied: “Haven’t you got something more serious to worry about ”Corbyn had met Claudia in  — seven years after his orce from first we Jane Chapman — at a protest meeting against Chile’s military dictatorship.Claudia was already married but, by the following year, she was pregnant with Corbyn’s child and rushed through a orce to marry her new admirer.They went on to have three boys — Sebastian, Benjamin and Thomas — before calling time on their relationship in .Corbyn managed to give the split a political spin, declaring the break was down to Claudia refusing to send their son to a failing comprehensive and he “felt strongly about comprehensive education”.But fellow Labour firebrand Ken Livingstone claims the marriage ended “long before the school bit”.She recalled: “Jeremy professed love early on and said that I was ‘the best of the best’, so I thought this must be the thing.”But the -year-old bride quickly discovered that “her husband was not interested in equality within marriage, or in sharing any domestic chores”.Despite the two of them both being councillors, she found herself doing the housework and being stuck alone in their small flat night after night.When Corbyn did arrive in time for dinner, he would often open a tin of beans, usually Tesco’s own brand, and eat them cold.On livelier evenings, he would sit on the floor drunkenly singing IRA songs. Jane’s requests to go out were ignored.Meanwhile, she was shocked that the opinionated “thinker” did not read a single book during their years together.Author Tom Bower writes: “Her initial judgment that he was ‘bright’ was mistaken.”Holidays were also grim — with his idea of a summer getaway being a tour with his we of an impoverished Eastern bloc country, sleeping in tents. The marriage ended in , with Corbyn patronisingly putting the split down to a “feminist kick”.Chapman, now a university professor and filmmaker, said: “He didn’t acknowledge my emotional side. He doesn’t recognise a woman’s feelings.”She added: “His lack of emotional awareness didn’t change.”And, in his new book, author Tom Bower claims it was a result of Corbyn’s poor financial management. Corbyn was funding his party office in Holloway, North London, out of his own pocket and was seriously in debt.Claudia and their three young sons were left with so little money for food and clothes that she once pleaded: “We can’t afford a decent le.”Eventually, after the couple split, the family home in Islington, North London, was sold for £,to pay off the debts.Claudia and the boys moved into the top floors of a smaller home, with Corbyn in the basement. There he had a series of flings with younger women, according to Bower’s book, out on February .His success with the opposite sex confused many, with one old friend telling him: “You couldn’t pull all these womenyou weren’t an MP. They wouldn’t be interested in an old man with a beard.”The hard-Left MP for North Islington was far more understanding when it came to Soviet communist leaders oppressing others.His old friend Keith Veness said Corbyn believed Soviet leaders had rightly put down a revolt in Hungary in  and the pro-democracy Prague Spring in .And when Veness mentioned Joseph Stalin’s brutality against his own people, he says: “Jeremy walked away. He couldn’t do political arguments.”In the extract from his book in yesterday’s Mail on Sunday, author Bower also portrays Corbyn’s party as an anarchic mess where neither the leader nor many of his overpaid team turn up for meetings on time.He writes: “Meetings arranged to start at am were delayed because no one arrived until , and some staff did not come to work at all.” An insider told the author: “They were lazy and p***ed on £, a year.”Meanwhile, in the same year as his orce, Corbyn met Mexican ex-human rights lawyer Laura Alez,  years his junior.They conducted a long-distance relationship before she moved to the UK in , and they wed the following year.Laura has rarely spoken about their relationship — but, in , gave a telling insight into marriage with the proud leftie: “He’s not very good at housework.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We just don’t know whether there would have been a better way of spending the money.You might ask the question what  could you do  You could give larger sums of money to Manchester to Birmingham, to Newcastle and let them do as they saw best for their local communities.”HS is meant to cut journeys between London and Birmingham from  hour and  minutes to  minutes.That sparked Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom to question the “viability” of HS and the whole business case of the line.The proposed route is expected to cut through parts of her South Northamptonshire constituency.A maximum speed of  mph could be imposed when trains travel through tunnels between the capital and Birmingham to cut the construction budget.Last year Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said that the second phase of the project connecting Birmingham to Leeds may never be built.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

PC Moss said: “One day he was in the kennels, and now he’s a fully-fledged police dog.Owners don’t always have experience with this breed of dog, which can be where some of the stereotypes about Staffies come from.“Having Cooper when doing a raid is a great ice-breaker. People are shocked we are working a Staffie – as either they have or they know someone who has one.”PC Moss reckons Cooper is one of the best police dogs in Staffordshire and has become something of an A-lister in his county, being invited on school tours and to meet the public.He believes the negative stereotypes surrounding Staffies could not be ­further from the truth.He added: “Staffies are very unique.”Staffordshire bull terriers are so misunderstood.”WHEN Andy Hutchins left London’s ­Pentonville Prison five years ago after ­serving time for burglary, he planned to use the £ in his pocket to buy a fatal dose of heroin and take his own le.But a tiny puppy named Bailey changed that. Andy, now , bought the four-week-old dog from a woman begging on the street.Thanks to Bailey, Andy turned his back on crime and drugs – despite having spent  years in and out of jail – and is now ­training to be a social worker.Andy recalls how he spotted two women using two tiny pups “as small as mice” to beg. He pleaded for them to be ed to their mum – and one of the women agreed to sell him a pup for £.He took the dog straight to the vet – who recommended it be put down.But Andy refused and he kept ­Bailey huddled close and fed him a diet of goat’s milk and mashed potato. ­Bailey soon thrived.Andy turned his back on crime and on his £-a-day heroin habit.He said: “Having Bailey made me get my act together. I couldn’t be out of it because I had to protect him and make sure he was fed.”The first year was tough.He and Bailey were both attacked. ­Bailey was shot at and even stolen when he was three months old – Andy had to raise £ to buy him back.Then the pair got support from StreetVet, a charity that gives free vet ­treatment to animals living with homeless people, and co-founder Sam Joseph helped Andy find housing.Andy said: “When StreetVet came along, they ­provided food for him and it meant I could get on a methadone programme and rebuild my le.“When dealers came trying to sell drugs, he’d growl and bark at them. He seem­ed to know he needed to take care of me.”Former builder Andy’s le had spiralled downward after taking heroin for the first time aged .His relationship with his ­former partner and son broke down and he lost his job, his home and possessions.He was caught in a cycle of crime to fund his habit. He added: “Bailey meant I had a le to be responsible for. He saved me the day I saved him.“Having this little dog relying on me taught me how to love and trust again and I owe my le to him.”SHE was used as a breeding machine then cruelly dumped at the side of a road.Yet Bindi went on to help her caring new owner – and five other dogs.After being abandoned in September , Bindi was rescued by Senior Staffy Club, a charity dedicated to older Staffies.There she had  tumours removed from her body and was nursed back to care, eventually finding a full-time home with NHS worker Vicky Osborn.Vicky, , from Manchester, said: “I’d just lost my mum and we both saved each other.It was like we were meant to find each other. Within a week she was my shadow, my best friend.”But four months later, Bindi’s tumours ed, growing aggressively, and the dog, then , was moved to palliative care.Determined for her last weeks to be full of positivity, Vicky asked the Senior Staffy Club to set up a donation fund, Bindi’s ­Legacy, to help other dogs with cancer.Bindi died last September but the fund has since raised more than £, and already paid for operations for five dogs.Vicky said: “Senior Staffy Club gave Bindi two extra years of high-quality le after a miserable existence and now she is giving a similar gt to other dogs.“Bindi gave unconditional love, found joy in everything and instinctively knew how to comfort when I felt down.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their foolishness means Britain must give away a fixed . per cent of national income at a time when global poverty is plummeting due to capitalism, scientic progress and technological advances.Now some Tories are trying to find ways to keep their promise to hit this aid target, while spending the money in fresh ways. That exposes the ­shallowness of ministers’ ­posturing as heroic saviours of the poor and dispossessed.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told the Cabinet last month this level of aid spending was “unsustainable” and money should be shted to domestic priorities.She has floated the idea of ­building new ships for the Royal Navy from the aid ­budget by using them for humanitarian operations.And she knows the issue will rear up in any forthcoming Tory leadership battle.Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson chipped in, saying Britain needs more control over what counts as foreign aid under international rules — and that it should go towards boosting British foreign policy objectives.His move was linked to a report by former soldier turned Tory MP Bob Seely arguing that Britain should simply define its own aid spending to include our ­“strategic goals”.Yet they all miss the obvious solution. Just DITCH the target and abandon the  law binding us to it — one that makes the Department for International Developmentthe only ministry that must explain itself to MPsit fails to spend enough.This silly UN target is an historic anachronism devised by campaigners half a century ago based on flawed, outdated economic data.It makes no sense to rely on a fixed spending target based on national income over needs in poor places — as predicted by a former Tory Chancellor, respected Labour peers and a British economist who won the Nobel Prize for their expertise in poverty.One horried DfID minister confessed to me he thought spending was at least TRIPLE what it should be — yet whenever he tried to thwart wasteful projects, they simply bounced back from officials on to his desk again.It was no surprise to find those pen-pushers in the poverty relief department are among the best-paid bureaucrats in Whitehall.This torrent of cash has fuelled a self-serving aid industry stuffed with fat cats on six-figure salaries in charities and private firms.These people are so focused on protecting their valuable brands that some of the best-known organisations covered up abuse, rape, malpractice and theft.Their political paymasters pose as municent saviours of the world. Yet as I have seen on three continents, much of the money taken from taxpayers is blown on ludicrous projects based on bogus statistics — and ends up doing more harm than good by fostering conflict and undermining democracy.I was in Ghana last year, investigating a UK-funded scheme to pour cash into a few villages to prove aid works.“Far from breaking the poverty trap, the project does not appear to have reduced poverty or hunger at all,” concluded DfID’s own report.Yet we give cash to fast-emerging powerhouses such as China and India.We give cash to countries riddled with corruption, such as Uganda, where I found officials inflating the number of refugees to grab more funds from foreign donors.We give cash to places that have space programmes, even their own aid agencies.And we pour cash into countries run by gangsters spending huge sums on weapons — and in Rwanda’s case, on the brutal president’s favourite Premier League football club, Arsenal.Even North Korea, which runs massive death camps under a bloodstained family dictatorship, has been a beneficiary of UK aid. This is what happens when politicians prioritise spin and spending over needs and reality.Holland has showed a country can get off this hook. It abandoned the target and found the anticipated fuss died down quickly.The sht led to renewed focus on efficient spending, with fewer countries receiving donations. “We were surprised it was so easily dealt with,” one insider told me.Dutch spending has dipped from . per cent of national income in  to . per cent last year and will fall again over the coming years.Let us welcome the dawning realisation in Westminster that fixating on an aid target has been a dire failure.Instead of tinkering with definitions — or deceiving voters by slipping domestic spending under the foreign aid banner — politicians should accept their mistake and abandon that daft targetOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Amber Rudd said she accepted a link between soaring food bank use and the Government’s hated flagship benefit shake-up. She told MPs that the dficulties in accessing cash could have been “the main issue” behind the surge in people going hungry. The number of emergency food parcels handed out by the Trussell Trust charity has soared from , in   to .million last year.It came as two influential anti-poverty MPs suggested that Ms Rudd was on the brink of making radical changes to Universal Credit . Tory MP Heidi Allen and independent Labour MP Frank Field, who have launched a major investigation into food bank use, told the Mirror that her “legs are moving”.Previously, senior Tories have refused to accept welfare changes were a factor in the rise - instead claiming there were several dferent causes.Theresa May said in April  there were “many complex reasons” why people used food banks.Ms Rudd’s predecessor Esther McVey previously tried to blame the explosion on Labour, who she said “refused” to let Jobcentres signpost people to them before . Just four months ago a junior DWP minister, Alok Sharma, prompted shouts of “pathetic” as he insisted the rise could not be attributed to a single reason.   But Ms Rudd finally admitted to MPs: “It is absolutely clear that there were challenges with the initial rollout of Universal Credit. “And the main issue that led to an increase in food bank use could have been the fact that people had dficulty accessing their money early enough. “We have made changes to accessing Universal Credit so that people can have advances, so that there is a legacy run-on after two weeks, of housing benefit, and we believe that will help with food insecurity.” The Welfare Secretary insisted things had improved since the initial rollout of the six-in-one welfare system.  The Trussell Trust, Britain’s biggest foodbank network, has long insisted UC was behind a surge in demand at its outlets. Chief executive Emma Revie said: “It’s promising to see the Secretary of State is listening to the evidence of food banks across the UK. “We’re a country that prides itself on making sure proper support is in place for each other when help is most needed – our benefits system was created to do exactly this. “But Universal Credit isn’t the poverty-fighting reform that was promised. “What we need now is action to address the reasons why Universal Credit has forced some people to food banks.” People moving on to the benefit were until last year forced to wait six weeks for their first payment.   Even with the huge delay, a whopping % were not paid their full amount on time as of July last year. The standard delay has since been cut to five weeks, which Ms Rudd has accepted despite campaigners warning it is still pushing people into poverty. Ms Rudd also told MPs: “I have acknowledged the fact that people had dficulty accessing the money on time as one of the causes for the growth in food banks. “But we have tried to address that and one of the principal ways of doing that is ensuring every applicant can have advance payments on the day that they apply.” In an interview with the Mirror, veteran anti-poverty campaigner Mr Field predicted she would halt the roll-out of UC before the Government’s deadline of . “Amber has been burned by what happened at the Home Office. She ain’t going to be brought down again by what civil servants tell her about what is advisable,” he said. “By all means the date is good cover but the Secretary of State’s legs are moving.” Tory MPs Ms Allen, who voted for welfare cuts in  but has campaigned against UC ever since, called for Ms Rudd to scrap the five week wait. “It’s changing with Amber, which is why the timing of our investigation is so important. “She clearly is listening. Now is particularly important timing-wise that we demonstrate what it’s like out there and that there are problems with the system,” she said.   “I want to prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, so that the Government cannot ignore it any longer, the fundamental flaws of the welfare system that must be changed.”Jeremy Corbyn said on Monday: “The Conservatives have now admitted that Universal Credit has left even more people reliant on food banks.“So why haven’t they stopped the roll out ” The PM’s official spokesman said: “We have long acknowledged that there were issues with the initial rollout of Universal Credit and that’s why we have listened and made improvements such as extending advances, removing waiting days and introducing housing benefit run-on. “These changes are giving support to vulnerable people who need it most while at the same time helping people get into work faster.” A DWP spokesman added: “We have always said that there are many reasons people use food banks and you cannot link to any one cause, we’ve responded quickly to the feedback we have had on UC and made numerous improvements.” Last August the Department for Work and Pensionslaunched an internal study costing pound, to examinewelfare policies have prompted food bank use.

Mr Grayling quoted ata letter from Arklow Shipping which gave assurances over Seaborne Freight. In his initial reply to the urgent question, Mr Grayling earlier said there are contractual options to replace the Seaborne Freight capacity with additional capacity on routes in the North Sea and this is an option well be discussing across government in the coming days.

The Health Secretary has a duty to ensure that all who rely on NHS services can access them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mps touring country hear real","story":"NewsThe MPs touring the country to hear real stories of Britains food bank miseryFrank Field and Heidi Allen went to Morecambe Bay to hear heart-rending stories of locals hit by Government cuts and frustrated by welfare red tapeShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor:,  FEB NewsFrank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee and Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire Heidi Allen \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo minutes from Morecambe Bay’s windswept seafront,  local people and two MPs are packed into a church community centre which hosts a foodbank. Some  miles from Westminster, St Barnabas Church stands on the corner of Westminster Road in Morecambe’s West End and is two junctions from Parliament Street. It could not be more dferent from its famous, powerful namesakes to the south.Yet it is here the MPs – Independent Frank Field, formerly of Labour , and Conservative Heidi Allen – have come to listen, not talk.They want to hear the awful, heart-rending stories of how townsfolk have been hit by Government cuts, frustrated by a welfare system rapped in red tape and, in some cases, hammered by sheer bad luck. The Commons Work and Pensions Committee – which Frank chairs and of which Heidi is a member - is investigating poverty across our land and Morecambe is the latest stop on their grim tour which also takes in Newcastle, Leicester and London.   Meet -year-old Daniel Burba. Daniel stoops above the formica-topped tables bearing cellophane-covered bowls of crisps, chocolate biscuits and Quality Street sweets. Frequently breaking down and physically supported by a friend, he snfs away his tears as he reveals how as a teenager he was lured into selling drugs by “big adults” on his estat. He hoped they were plotting his path out of poverty. “We were , we were kids. They forced you to sell heroin and crack. You’re so afraid of what will happen to youyou don’t do it,” he says. “There’s nothing . If all the youth stuff hadn’t been taken away, we wouldn’t have been pulled away to these streets, to these men. “A few of my mates had to hide guns for them. They pay you, and when you have younger brothers and sisters needing to be fed, it’s stressful trying to make the right decision. “F****** , I shouldn’t have had to put up with it. My mam and dad never knew where we was getting the money from. “I had a paper round, I pretended it was that.”   Daniel is dismayed by the bureaucracy of central and local government, and the hoops he had to jump through before he could receive help. He also rails against the box-ticking culture he feels riddles the system. “Treat me as you would want to be treated see me as a person, not a number,” he cries. And he echoes a familiar refrain, accusing the Government of fuelling a race where the “rich get richer and the poor get poorer”. Heidi wipes away a tear while Frank listens intently, taking notes for their investigation. Around the room, some guests’ eyes are damp. Others look genuinely angry. A baby, less than a year old, is desperately trying to force out her first words – innocent hope amid the downcast gloom.   Now meet Karen Wheeler, . Karen is well-spoken, almost posh. Her accent is not local. She speaks very quietly, almost whispering – a sign of her nerves as she confides the horrying route to her downfall. Karen played lacrosse at her private school. She has a masters degree, a teaching qualication and once briefed Government ministers in Whitehall. In  she was married, had an “excellent job” and was happy – until she was diagnosed with a neurological condition. She had breaks from work for health reasons then lost her mother and split from her husband.   The housing crisis hit and the family home sold for less than they hoped. Karen hurt her knee, had five operations and a knee replacement. Her mental health began to deteriorate and her daughter, Emily, also fell ill . Karen had to leave her latest job to look after her. Karen’s situation continued to spiral downhill. She used up her savings. She began self-harming, carving the words “failure”, “freak” and “waste of space” into her arms, legs and stomach. She thought about suicide. “I felt my daughter would be better off without me round,” she admits. “I stockpiled tablets waiting for the right moment. “The rent was impossible to pay, every letter and phone call was threatening. “The debts were racking up at an impossible rate and I was served an eviction notice.” She visited food banks – the local Trussell Trust outlet fed  people last month, up % on January  – and was baffled by the maze of DWP forms that needed completing before she could receive benefits. She also took personally the blizzard of stereotypes aimed at welfare claimants. “Every news bulletin seemed to be calling me a ‘scrounger’ or a ‘fraud’ or a ‘cheat’ or ‘scum’,” she says. “Poverty can happen to anyone, in any position, from any background, at any time. “All it requires is a chain of unfortunate events.” Karen’s voice trembles and she reaches for Emily, the strong, redhead teenager who supports her mother.   Emily, who is studying for A-levels, retains her composure as she matter-of-factly explains how she and her mum were often left with just pound-a-week after paying bills. Once, Emily’s school held a non-unorm day to raise cash for a children’s charity. Her classmates each donated a quid, but Emily could not afford to contribute. “People looked at me and I could tell they thought I was selfish by not wanting to part with a pound for a disadvantaged child,” she says. “No-one knew that might have been me. To them it probably seemed irrelevant but a pound meant milk or bread.” Another speaker tells of a family with five kids who have been burning wooden pallets as winter bites. These bleak, desperate and anguished stories do not even shock now. Calling for “the cuts to stop”, today’s organiser Siobhan Collingwood, a local headmistress, points out: “These are not extreme examples – this is the reality of daily le for far too many people living in our community.”One common complaint centres on Universal Credit , the Government’s flagship welfare overhaul which rolls six benefit payments into one.Delays and complications with the shake-up are shattering the Welfare State’s reputation for helping those most in need. Urging a revamp will form a major part of the MPs’ recommendations.   Frank vows: “The two policies we will be pressing most on will be to scrap the freeze on benefits and to,possible, make Universal Credit work.” Heidi adds: “The Universal Credit five week wait for the first payment is utterly dysal.” Those who bravely told of their personal plights despair of a system where, they believe, strict form-filling and tough regulations trump compassion and common sense. This is why they are speaking out - to remind the powerful that decisions taken in Westminster eventually ripple out across our country and, for some, can prove disastrous.

Admin worker Kellie - who has been deaf since the age of four with the cause of her hearing loss never having been established - has tried for pub, housekeeping and pot washing jobs. But she told the Mirror: “I have lost out due to my deafness. “I am being discriminated against and treated unfairly.”   She has the GCSEs and a NVQ Level  in Business Administration.

She believes recruiters who do not understand her disability and ‘push her away’ rather than giving her the chance ‘to shine’. “People with disabilities are more than capable of being extraordinaryonly someone would give us the opportunity,” she wrote recently. “In interviews,I struggle to understand what’s being said, I explain my disability. “Then I get the reply ‘there’s a lot of phone work in this role’ when it was not previously mentioned. “I can do the jobs I apply for.

The quick-fire nuptials began when Maddie and Alex, who had been engaged for a year, arrived for dinner at PizzaExpress in London. After revealing a friend of theirs had tipped off staff about their -month engagement, waitress Milly Threw declared: I have had a crazy idea, why dont you get married today    When Milly explained the couples friends and family were already on their way to the restaurant on Russia Way in London, primary school teacher Maddie and electrician Alex agreed to instantly tie the knot.

She was killed by tiger , Asim, who arrived at the zoo late last month specically to be her mate. The two tigers had been kept in neighbouring enclosures since Asims arrival so they could get used to each others smell. But when staff introduced the pair this morning, Sumatran Melati was brutally killed within minutes. Now, London Zoos chief operating officer, Kathryn England, has revealed what happened when the two Big Cats met each other for the first time.   Kathryn has known ten-year-old Melati since she joined London Zoo in  and says Friday was one of the most dficult days of my career. She described Melati as beautul, majestic, spirited – and every inch a tiger. The expert explained Asim, seven, had been brought to London Zoo from Denmark as part of the Europe-wide breeding programme for Sumatran tigers. Kathryn said: We started the day in nervous anticipation, excited than our beautul Sumatran tiger, Melati, would have to chance to become a mum again. Asim and Melati had been kept side-by-side, but separated by mesh, since his arrival at the zoo.  The pair had been callng and chuffing to one another - a good sign. Kathryn said: Both seemed comfortable and even chose to eat their breakfast within feet of each other. Chuffing is a friendly noise that tigers use to greet each other, usually during courtship or when a mum is greeting her cubs. It indicates interest and curiosity. It might be the human equivalent of a saying “hello lovely, how are you ”. Occasionally the tigers will chuff at their keepers too, and those are moments they all treasure. Staff at the zoo, with more than  years of experience between them, had been carefully observing Melati and Asim and on Friday thought the time was right to properly introduce them to one another.  Kathryn said: Several people from outside the zoo have remarked that  days seems fast to introduce tigers to each other. It’s not – it’s wildly iable and depends entirely on careful observation of their behaviour. Conversely, it can be risky to leave tigers showing an interest in each other out of contact for too long, leading to a build-up of tension and frustration. In the run up to Friday, plans were careful drawn up - including precautions as to how they would reactall did not go to plan. The team had fire extinguishers, air horns and flares ready to distract the Big Catsneeded. They did have transquiliser darts but these can be hard to shoot woth accuracy and can take up to  minutes to take effect. Kathryn said: The perimeter of the exhibit was carefully walked and checked for anything out of place that could alarm the tigers.  The surroundings were quiet and calm. We opened the gate between the two enclosures and watched carefully. Initially everything about their meeting was as we expected. They watched each other, they were cautiously interested and they snfed the air for several minutes. But then things began to take a tragic turn and Kathry explained that part of tigers’ natural behaviour is territorial and aggressive, and they are strong and fast animals. Males often posture at females to show their dominance and both tigers swiped and reared up at each other. Then tragedy struck. Kathryn said: In the blink of an eye, with no obvious provocation, they turned on each other and our years of experience told us it was beyond normal.  The initial skirmish lasted a few seconds and we were already reacting. Asim started to retreat and we were poised to close the gate when Melati lashed back out at him. He overpowered her in a split second. Everyone sprang into action lighting flares, sounding airhorns and setting off fire extinguishers and hoses. Unfortunately by the time Asim retreated the second time and we could close the gate, Melati had been fatally injured. It took moments. Everyone was numb with shock, and the sheer disbelief was palpable. As soon it was safe our vets ran to Melati with every hope they might yet save her, and even these experienced professionals of the zoo world were entirely distraught to find they couldn’t. Staff had to turn their attention to Asim, who had also been through an ordeal. Kathryn stressed the breeding programme was key because of the very real threat of extinction that tigers are facing.  She said: Melati had a crucial role here generating advocacy for a species that is perilously on the brink a role that she was clearly fulfilling gauging by the reaction to her passing. I would love to see this awful moment trigger a greater understanding of the challenges faced by her species in the wild. Melati contributed to a more secure future for tigers, not only through her cubs but through the affinity she built with our many visitors – reinforcing why zoos like ours play such an important role in the future of wild animals. Upset animal lovers have expressed their horror following Melatis death on Twitter . Lauren Hickling wrote: As a regular visitor of Melati, we went last weekend in fact, I am very sad to hear of this awful news. Lib With Attitude added: This has brought tears to my eyes on the train. Melati was so beautul. And Samantha Smith said: My daughter is absolutely devastated. Melati was a beautul tigress. Rainbow Kitty wrote: Such a sad loss of a beautul creature. RIP Melati, over the rainbow bridge. Zookeepers had flown to Denmark to get to know the male Sumatran. At the time they said: We learned that he adores chicken and loves to play, particularly by pouncing on piles of empty boxes sprayed with strong scents such as herbs and spices.

The family are again caught up in a storm after their dad, Thomas, , published extracts from a letter Meghan wrote to him after their wedding. Snippets released from the five-page note showed Meghan, , telling Thomas Markle that he had broken her heart “into a million pieces”.   And referring to Samantha, Meghan wrote: On a daily basis you ﬁxated and clicked on the lies they were writing about me, especially those manufactured by your other daughter, who I barely know… you watched me silently suffer at the hand of her vicious lies, I crumbled inside. She accused her dad of lying about her and Prince Harry in press stories, and family members say their relationship is now damaged beyond repair . Heartbroken Meghan also criticised Thomas for exploiting her relationship to the royal in extracts published by the Mail on Sunday . Now her half-sister Samantha told The Sun that he is prepared to release more of it.   She said: It is nasty. Dad is prepared to release more of it. She claims despite not changing her number, her father has not attempted to call her or message her. The Duchess also slams Mr Markle for siding with her half-sister Samantha, who has attacked her in the press while she silently suffers at the hand of her vicious lies. Last week People magazine revealed the letters existence, and anonymous friends of Meghans said they were concerned the emotional trauma of dealing with her dad could have a negative effect on her baby.  They said she was so upset by her fathers public attacks on her and Prince Harry that she wrote the anguished letter begging him to patch up their dferences privately. In retaliation, Mr Markle released parts of his daughters letter publicly, calling it hateful. Meghan’s half-brother Thomas Jnr, , said: “There’s no trust between them. The relationship is broken beyond repair. It’s so sad to see.” The full extracts from Meghans five-page letter released so far Daddy, It is with a heavy heart that I write this, not understanding why you have chosen to take this path, turning a blind eye to the pain you’re causing. Your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces — not simply because you have manufactured such unnecessary and unwarranted pain, but by making the choice to not tell the truth as you are puppeteered in this. Something I will never understand. You’ve told the press that you called me to say you weren’t coming to the wedding — that didn’t happen because you never called. You’ve said I never helped you ﬁnancially and youve never asked me for help which is also untrue you sent me an email last October that said: ‘If I’ve depended too much on you for ﬁnancial help then I’m sorry but pleaseyou could help me more not as a bargaining chip for my loyalty.’  I have only ever loved, protected, and defended you, offering whatever ﬁnancial support I could, worrying about your health... and always asking how I could help. So the week of the wedding to hear about you having a heart attack through a tabloid was horrying. I called and texted... I begged you to accept help — we sent someone to your home... and instead of speaking to me to accept this or any help, you stopped answering your phone and chose to only speak to tabloids. If you love me, as you tell the press you do, please stop. Please allow us to live our lives in peace. Please stop lying, please stop creating so much pain, please stop exploiting my relationship with my husband... I realise you are so far down this rabbit hole that you feelthere’s no way out, butyou take a moment to pause I think you’ll see that being able to live with a clear conscience is more valuable than any payment in the world. I pleaded with you to stop reading the tabloids. On a daily basis you ﬁxated and clicked on the lies they were writing about me, especially those manufactured by your other daughter, who I barely know… you watched me silently suffer at the hand of her vicious lies, I crumbled inside. We all rallied around to support and protect you from day , and this you know. So to hear about the attacks you’ve made at Harry in the press, who was nothing but patient, kind, and understanding with you is perhaps the most painful of all.  For some reason you choose to continue fabricating these stories, manufacturing this ﬁctitious narrative, and entrenching yourself deeper into this web you’ve spun. The only thing that helps me sleep at night is the faith and knowing that a lie can’t live forever. …I believed you, trusted you, and told you I loved you. The next morning the CCTV footage came out. You haven’t reached out to me since the week of our wedding, and while you claim you have no way of contacting me, my phone number has remained the same. This you know. No texts, no missed calls, no outreach from you — just more global interviews you’re being paid to do to say harmful and hurtful things that are untrue.

The murderer known as Jack the Stripper claimed more victims than his Victorian namesake Jack the Ripper during a grisly spree in the s – but the monster was never caught. Now, new information could lead to the identity of the man behind the Hammersmith nude murders. David Wilson, a former prison governor and professor of criminology at Birmingham City University, has handed evidence he collected to the Met Police, who are considering it. After a -month probe – detailed in a BBC documentary tonight – Prof Wilson is convinced Jack the Stripper was Welsh child killer Harold Jones. He says he found crucial links between Jones and the murder of at least six sex workers in the then red light district of West London around Shepherd’s Bush.   The sadistic crimes, in which the killer strangled and stripped his victims before removing their teeth, sparked one of the biggest manhunts in history. “Lots of people put forward dferent theories about the identity of the killer,” says Prof Wilson. “But, frankly, only one really stands out. Andwe could prove this theory, it has every possibility of delivering to the Met something they didn’t have  years ago, and that’s a genuine prime suspect.”  Jones died of bone cancer in Hammersmith in , and the children of Jack the Stripper’s victims still await justice. One of the first victims, -year-old prostitute Hannah Tailford, originally from Northumberland, was found dead on February , , her body fished out of the Thames at Hammersmith.   She had been strangled, several of her teeth were missing and her underwear had been forced down her throat. Her son Steven Sloman, , said: “The general attitude then was just, ‘Well, it’s just a prostitute’. “At the end of the day, whatever happened, she was a mum. “Justice was not done and I would like them to open to case, find evidence and maybe come up with closure, and say, ‘It could have been this person here’.”  By the time of the killings – the other victims were pregnant Irene Lockwood, , Helen Barthelemy, , Mary Fleming, , Frances Brown, , and Bridget O’Hara,  – Jones was already a convicted double child killer. When he was , Jones murdered Freda Burnell, eight, in Abertillery, Monmouthshire, but was acquitted due to lack of physical evidence. Just  days later, he murdered -year-old Florence Little, hiding her body in his parents’ attic, and confessed to murdering Freda after his second trial. He escaped hanging due to his age and was instead got  years’ jail. After his release from Wandsworth Prison in , he joined the Merchant Navy.  Then, according to Prof Wilson in documentary Dark Son: The Hunt for a Serial Killer, Jones changed his name to Harold Stevens and moved to Fulham, near Shepherd’s Bush – putting him in the area when the murders took place in  and . Prof Wilson also found a link between Jones and an industrial estate where police think bodies were kept before being dumped. There is also evidence he worked as a  beater, giving him access to paint found on four victims. And like Jack the Stripper, Prof Wilson presents evidence of Jones storing his victims’ bodies and having sadistic tendencies.  “These women were shysadistically murdered and because of that sadism – which had a sexual shyovertone – they lost their lives,” he said. “Sadism doesn’t dissipate over time, sadism always finds some way of expressing itself in terms of the killer’s le and lestyle. “There is an uncanny mirroring of these early murders in the s and how aspects are reappearing in those murders in the s.”Dark Son: The Hunt for a Serial Killer is on BBC at pm on Tuesday night and its available on BBC iPlayer now."},{"url":null,"title":"nurses tragic final message after","story":"NewsNurses tragic final message after being told SIX TIMES she didnt have cancerJulie O’Connor, , said her suffering was “disgusting” as shes propped up in her hospice bed three days before her deathShareCommentsByAndrew GilpinNeil Murphy:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news offline video husband-shares-emotional-video-dying-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA terminally-ill nurse used a heartbreaking final message to criticise the hospital she claims missed several chances todiagnose her cancer. Julie O’Connor, , said the way she suffered was “disgusting” in a video shot just before she died. She said doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol did not spot she was suffering from cervical cancer as shes seen propped up in her hospice bed, only able to whisper. The mum-of-twom who worked for the NHS for  years, said: “I think it took six attempts for the cancer to be diagnosed. It’s disgusting I have been suffering the way I have and I continue to suffer. During the video, Julie appears weak and short of breath as she recounts her ordeal to the camera. She died three days after it was shot at St Peters Hospice in Bristol.  Julie, of Thornbury, Glos, complained of symptoms in , but a test came back negative. She added she had numerous biopsies and examinations, but that it was not until three years after the initial diagnosis a private consultant informed her she had cancer. Husband Kevin then tells the camera doctors failed to diagnose her illness over a period of three years. We hold them fully accountable, he says. The pathologist and the gynaecologist, who had several opportunities to intervene, I hold them responsible, and I do hold the board of directors at North Bristol Trust accountable.  They put me and Julie through this. What we want to do with this video is to show the board of directors what they’ve done. What they’ve done to me and Julie and our family. And I just hope this doesn’t happen to anybody . We want a wider review. Dr Chris Burton, of North Bristol NHS Trust, said: “We are committed to understanding the full circumstances of the care we provided so we can improve our services. “We’ll be publicly open with the findings of the independent [probe] we’ve commissioned.”Last year Julie told the Bristol Post that in  was given the all clear, despite that result being wrong.Three years later, after what Julie describes as a “catalogue of errors”, her cancer spread out of control and became incurable.  “It’s too late now to cure me. I am having chemotherapy and radiotherapy but all they can do is give me palliative care to prolong my le,” Julie said back then. “If they had caught it back in  or even  it could’ve been a completely dferent story. “My main concern now is making sure that other women who had tests back in  and  are aware thatthey are having ongoing symptoms or think something is wrong they should challenge the results and get retested,” she added. Julie sued the hospital and going public with her story had been dficult for her family, especially her two children.  “But they understand that we are trying to help other women who might be given this devastating news,” she said. “The hospital are saying it is only me whose tests were wrong but they are reluctant to do a wider review of other smears even though we have pleaded with them to. “The last thing I want to do is put people off having smears, but just to question thingsyou are having symptoms like I was then challenge it and push it further,” she added.

Two men wearing balaclavas were caught on camera using a blow torch to burn off the locks on the front door of a family home in Bradford. Once inside they grabbed a set of car keys and stole a pound, Audi S Quattro - even using the torch to defrost the windscreen before driving off. Police say the technique is becoming increasingly common as thieves come up with new and unusual ways to break into properties. The latest incident, which happened at am in the morning, follows a spate of similar crimes across the north of England. Police believe criminals are targeting homes with PVC doors, melting the locks to gain entry to the property.   Taira Abdul-Khaliq, , who owns the car in the latest incident, said police had been unable to find any evidence at the scene due to the burnt out locks. She said: Im so angry, its unbelievable. Im off work at the moment because Im furious. Its a violation. They came in with blowtorches. I work in a local school and theres not many women who drive high-powered cars so lots of people know who I am. We were advised by police thatburglars break in, theyll come and wake you up for car keys and they might hurt you. So every night, we leave the keys on the stairs so they dont come and threaten us.   And thats exactly what they did, they searched our coats, stole our wallets and then started coming upstairs. Last April, police in Bradford warned of at least eight incidents where a blowtorch was used to gain access to a house. Other burglaries involving the flame-throwers have been reported in Sedgefield and Newton Ayclfe, County Durham, and Sutton-in-Craven and Crosshills, north Yorkshire and Keighley and Bingley, west Yorks. As the pair drove away, Tairas phone briefly connected with her cars dash cam and recorded the burglars comments as they realised the windscreen was iced up. Clearly unable to see, one of them can be heard saying: Lighter...get the lighter. Stick your head out of the window man! Teacher Taira added: Its just a few seconds but I can hear their voices and theyre local. Its so upsetting, it could be anyone I know. My neighbours CCTV captures them using the blowtorches down the road to defrost the windscreen.   I couldnt believe it when I saw it. That car was beautul. Everything I had I put into that car - I dont drink, smoke or go out clubbing. As long as I had my car, I was happy. It was a beauty, theres no car like it. My husband and I have been trying for children for a long time and I went for IVF. I had a horric experience where it went wrong and they found a cm polyp which they had to test for cancer. After that, when I received the all clear, I said to my husband that I was going to treat myself and this was my gt. Craven Inspector Geoff Crocker urged homeowners to update outdated locks and review their home security.   He said last year: I want to reassure the public that we are doing everything we can to apprehend the criminals who are committing these crimes. I would also recommend that residents review their home security arrangements and consider having snapsafe locks fitted to external doors front back and patio doors. Julie McCulloch, from Keighley, was one of those targeted last May. Thieves melted the door of her family home in a bid to steal her sons week-old Audi A.

A deeply troubled man was sitting on the edge of an overpass with a rope around his neck about to take his own le. Devonte Cafferkey, , Sammy Farah, , and Shawn Young, just  at the time, didnt panic. In fact, the incredible quick-thinking, heroism and compassion of the boys, who go to St Mary’s High School in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, saved the mans le. They tried to keep him back from the edge, talk him around, and when he went to jump, they grabbed onto him and refused to let go. As Shawn then calmly rang for help, two other passers-by came to the boys aide and the man was rescued. The three children are now to be recognised nationally for their bravery at the A overpass in Waltham Cross, last September. Shawn’s mum, Carol, has been amazed at the boys’ maturity and said they have just got on with it since their le-saving efforts.  They were coming from school and loitering around, Shawn was telling them to hurry up, said the -year-old. If they had been messing around a bit longer, who knows what they would have come and met instead  I feel like they were meant to be there to help him. Shawn told me what happened when he came home. I let him finish the whole story and the whole way through I was smiling because there was nothing I could add to it. While trying to keep the man back and talk him out of suicide, he passed the boys his mobile phone saying  it rings, don’t answer it. The boys were helped by -year-old Joanne Stammers, who is registered disabled with Klippel–Treacutenaunay syndrome, a rare disability that makes her highly prone to blood clotting.  Despite her condition, which prevents her from working, Joanne took over from the boys and held onto the man for what feels like forever and was left with bruising all over her arms. Another man, James Higlett, did his part in saving the man’s le. All five will receive awards from the Royal Humane Society, a charity promoting le-saving intervention. Shawns mum Carol is immensely proud of the boys behaviour. She said: I am extremely proud of all three of them, they are all good boys and it’s nice that they are getting recognised for doing something good in the community. Quite often in the national news there are a lot of negative reports about young people so it is nice to have something positive. They are very young and I marvel at how they are all dealing with it.

I want to find out where they came from so I can check on any remaining puppies and the mother dog. “If anyone knows of any puppies born on Wednesday or Thursday who have gone missing since, recognises the towel or saw anything they think might help my investigation please get in touch.” Anyone with any information should call the RSPCA inspector appeal line on    and ask to leave a message for Inspector Wilson. Inspector Wilson added: “No animal should be disposed of in this way - finding them has greatly upset the workers.   “If they were dumped alive I dread to think of the suffering they would have endured as there is still snow and ice on the ground in this area. We are always a call away to help with any unexpected arrivals.” Earlier in he day in Stockport, Greater Manchester, a Cavatoo puppy called Buffy had to be put down after it was crushed by a bigger dog. Devastated owner Sophia Siddiqui said that vets tried to save the minuscule pup, even giving it methadone for the pain.

Felicity Kadlec, , wed the love of her le Kelly Rossi, a zombie doll who she claims is -years-old, in front of her other dolls. The beautul ceremony, which took place in Tiverton, Rhode Island, USA, cost Felicity - covering her own wedding dress, a suit for Kelly and decorations for the outdoor venue. Alongside four of her family friends, eight of Felicitys other dolls also attended the ceremony to show their support in the ceremony six months ago. Felicity, who now lives in Vinita, Oklahoma, claims that marrying Kelly has made her feel closer and more intimate with her.   Felicity said: Our wedding ceremony was beautul and perfect - exactly the way I dreamed it would have been. I made sure that the whole wedding was done properly so it would be as official as possible, and we consummated the marriage afterwards. Kelly was the groom as she takes the male role in our relationship, she is a tom boy so wore a suit - I feel she was most comfortable as the groom. Despite having been in a relationship with Kelly for four years, getting married to her has made me feel so much closer to her, both emotionally and intimately.   Felicity was initially gted Kelly by her late father after becoming obsessed with horror movies and zombie dolls. She said: I found Kelly on a creepy doll collection website and my dad bought her for me when I was . It wasn’t until I was  years old that I started to get feelings for her, but it was something that I kept on trying to deny. When my father died last year, I found myself becoming closer and finding comfort in Kelly, as she was someone that he had bought for me. I finally allowed myself to be open with who I was and let my feelings come out and, despite not everyone agreeing with my love le, I have never felt happier.  When I started to feel more confident in my relationship, I knew I had to marry Kelly, but I waited until September as thats the same month as our birthdays so I knew it would be extra special. Despite Kellys zombie-like appearance, Felicity claims that she loves her doll deeply and wouldnt change her for the world. She said: I married Kelly but only because I accept her for who she is, I look past her bloody face and I dont mind her not having a jaw.  Also her spirit and personality traits made me know that she was the one for me and that I wanted to spend the rest of my le with her. To me, she is perfect, and I can feel that she loves me very deeply and I can sense her happiness since we have married. Just seeing her at the alter when I walked down the aisle was amazing, and to me she looked beautul. I am intimate with Kelly – I caress her and feel safe with her, and I feel a genuine connection when I’m having an intimate moment with her.

The SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, that launched last February, is now barreling through space with its dummy payload of the car and its “driver” beyond the orbit of Mars. However, there is said to be a “signicant possibility” it could crash into Venus or Earth. In a joint research paper, published under the title of The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets, scientists predict Starman’s journey over the next few million years.They find that Earth, Venus and the Sun are the three most likely crash targets, thereported. Meanwhile, collisions with Mercury and Mars are the least likely outcome. And this is the same for Jupiter’s gravity catapulting the vehicle out of the solar system. However, there is no need to start panicking just yet asit does happen, it will not be for another million years. Orbital dynamics expert Professor Hanno Rein said: “Although we are not able to tell on which planet the car will ultimately end up, we’re comfortable saying it won’t survive in space for more than a few tens of millions of years.” The boffins said that Starman, the brainchild of billionaire entrepreneur Musk, will be closest to Earth within the first  years of its launch and to get an idea of distance, it will be was close as the Moon.   The study reads: “Using an ensemble of several hundred realisations we were able to statistically determine the probability of the Tesla colliding with the Solar system planets on astronomical timescales. “Although some of the orbits experience effects due to mean-motion and secular resonances criss-crossing the NEA space, the orbital evolution remains initially dominated by close encounters with the terrestrial planets, in particular Earth, Venus and Mars.”  Last year, Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX made history by launching a ft mega rocket into space from Cape Canaveral, Florida. On board the rocket was a payload carrying a cherry red Tesla Roadster which blasted David Bowies Le on Mars from its stereo. As well as the roadster, which Musk, , used to drive to work, a mini Hot Wheels version of the Tesla sports car, with its own miniature Starman, is also on board. It appears to be fixed to the centre of the cars dashboard. So far, SpaceX has experienced  successful rocket launches, recovered  first stages and reflown six of these since the company was founded in .

But unlike  million who entered the US through the famous New York gateway, those who reach Brownsville have been told they are not welcome. President Donald Trump wants to build a pound.billion wall to keep the refugees out and has viciously attacked the caravans that started in Mexico. However, a band of volunteers called Team Brownsville cannot watch the suffering and do nothing. They refuse to simply stand by. Every morning at am, the team’s founders Mike Benavides and Spanish-speaking partner Sergio Cordova greet people from the local detention centre to provide them with clothing, food and help with a bus ticketthey need it.  We visited Brownsville on the first day of a ,-mile drive along the entire US border with Mexico to meet those most affected on what could be both sides of Trump’s wall. It is the most easterly legal port of entry to the States on the border. As we walked with Team Brownsville’s Ann Finch, , from Austin, Texas, Sage McKee,  from Spokane, Washington, and Pam Hancock, , from Denton, Texas, we were waved through by Mexican border patrol. We saw around  refugees waiting to be called by US authorities to begin their application for asylum. “It is shameful what the States has become under Trump,” says Sage. “A country built by immigrants turns their back on them.” Pam goes further. “Trump is a disgrace,” she storms.  “He has no empathy or compassion. You only need to listen to these people’s stories to understand what they have been through.” Migrants have been surging into Matamoros, just across the border and one of the most dangerous areas in the world thanks to drug cartel violence. Those lucky enough to make it past the gangs arrive at the crossing with the just the clothes on their backs. School administrator Mike says the group have helped around , migrants from more than  countries. Each applies for asylum andaccepted they are held in a detention centre until a sponsor is found.  If the application is successful, the sponsor pays a bond and they are dropped in Guantanamo Bay-type clothing at the local bus station. We meet Jacquelinne Jenner Puentes Aguilar, who says she would have been killedshe has stayed in El Congo in Santa Ana, El Salvador. Married for  years, raising her three children and her late sister’s son, the -year-old and her husband built up a small business selling clothes. But when gangster thugs learned of their modest success they demanded not only her earnings, but also her husband too.   She says: “My husband had to join the gang to save us from being slaughtered. But they still wanted money. When I told them I couldn’t pay they threatened to kill my children and me. “I couldn’t stay. I left my children with my parents and fled. “My husband is now in prison. I know I will never see him again.” Jacquelinne got to Mexico by foot and by bus. Once she made it into the country, she landed a job on a ranch but was held against her will before managing to escape.   Now, seven months after leaving her homeland, she is waiting to be processed into America’s asylum system, which could take  months. Lamin Jallow, , fled Brikama, The Gambia, after it emerged he had been secretly having an eight-year gay relationship and his boyfriend was killed. “Homosexuality is illegal in my country,” he says. “The punishment by the courts I could handle. The justice administered by the local community I could not. “I would be lynched like my boyfriend was before being killed. My father wanted me dead.” Lamin travelled through Senegal and managed to reach Ecuador, where he was granted a visa. After that expired, he set off north.   It took him a year and a half to walk to the US border, sleeping by day and travelling by night for safety. He is also waiting patiently at the border in Brownsville for his name to be called. Selfless Mike says he is hoping to take early retirement this year to dedicate himself full-time to the migrants. He says of those he has helped: “Despite what Trump would have the world believe, not one was near a bad person. It’s a lie. They are not rapists or killers or gang members.   “These people are young people who are running away from all that. They are pressured to join the gangs, andthey refuse their families are threatened or killed. “They merely want to live a le without violence and crime. “History will judge America for its treatment of migrants under Trump.” Trump is standing up for us — migrants cross my land daily For Vietnam special forces veteran Bill Miller, the only man who can liberate what he sees as his under-seige community is Donald Trump. Miller, , proudly flies a flag dedicated to the President outside his home, in a warning sign to the hundreds of illegal migrants he claims walk through his land every week. He said: “Donald Trump is the only man standing up for us. “He is the most honest President this country has ever had, anda liberal stepped on my land, I’d shoot them. I have migrants coming across my land every day, all of them illegally. All there is now where I am is a fence. The wall needs to be built. “There people are bringing crime and disease to this country, and they need to be stopped.” Miller lives along Route , in the border village of Columbus, New Mexico. He is one of hundreds of locals who support Trump’s wall. Many have bought dogs for protection from migrants, while others erected fences along their properties.  Columbus and nearby Hachita are the closest populated places to the Antelope Wells port of entry. A week ago, a group of  migrants were apprehended at the border crossing – the th group of  people or more since October. They come after the port of entry closes at pm, usually at night, and walk around the barriers. The Mirror found metal sheeting that migrants used to climb over the primitive barrier, just yards from the official crossing. Dan Stalnaker, , who lives in Hachita, said immigration is a “cause for huge concern”. He said: “The migrants are taking a huge toll on the American taxpayer. Something needs to be done.” But Mike Sims, , says local Border Patrol agents think the wall is “the dumbest idea”. He added: “If an illegal migrant is determined enough, they’ll find a way to get around it. We need our border patrols to be given better resources.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boost for dundee united as skipper st mirren skipper mcginn ruled out","story":"St Mirren captain Stephen McGinn is set to miss Saturday’s Scottish Cup last- clash with Dundee United.The -year-old went off with a hamstring injury as the Buddies fell three points adrt at the bottom of the Premiership with a - defeat to Motherwell on Wednesday night.“We checked him out and the hamstring is still quite sore,” boss Oran Kearney said. “It’s early days.

Kicking could do with improving, however.James HorsfieldAnother loanee, -year-old Horsfield is eager for game time after not featuring much for Scunthorpe this season.The former Man City kid, who has trained under Pep Guardiola, Manuel Pellegrini and Patrick Vieira, has shown a steady start at right-back both with the ball and defensively.Ryan McGowanThe Australian international has slotted in no problem at all and immediately strengthened the Dundee backline.Two strong performances already at centre-back, once he gets more settled there’s more to come.Andrew DaviesThe former Ross County skipper hasn’t had much luck in his time at Dens, breaking his foot in his first bounce game after signing.Injuries have been a feature of his career but all reports of his time in the Highlands and down south suggest, when he’s fit, he’s a strong leader at the back.Andreas HadeniusNot much was known about the big Swede before he signed for the Dark Blues just over a fortnight ago.We still don’t know too much but he’s shown in his two starts so far that he’s a ball-winner in the middle of the park who keeps possession ticking over.Ethan RobsonParent club Sunderland rate this kid highly and Jim McIntyre admitted he was surprised to be able to get the midfielder in on loan.His debut at Hamilton on Saturday largely passed him by before picking up a groin issue that kept him out of the - draw at Kilmarnock.Once up to speed, the hope is Robson can begin to realise the potential plenty down south recognise.John O’SullivanAnother loanee largely unknown up here, O’Sullivan made a fleeting debut at New Douglas Park last weekend.Andy DalesThe winger has made an impressive start to le up here. His direct, pacy running has caused defences plenty of problems but his final ball looks certain to frustrate Dees.Exciting player, though, and an asset to the team.Scott WrightThe talented forward hasn’t been able to push his way into Derek McInnes’ first team at Aberdeen yet and has joined Dundee to prove himself at this level.He’s fast becoming a favourite at Dens after a super goal at Hamilton and an impressive first-half showing against Kilmarnock.Craig CurranA frontman Jim McIntyre knows very well from his time at Ross County, Curran has shown he’ll work tirelessly and keep defenders honest. A tidy knock-down for the opening goal against Killie, too. More of that and the Dark Blues will be happy.Andrew NelsonWe were told the young striker was raw but full of talent and he’s shown that already. Three goals in five appearances have rocketed him to second-top scorer already this season but even when not scoring he gives defences a real headache.Will need support but already looks a real find."},{"url":null,"title":"no thanks dundee fans group rejects owners bid for full control of club","story":"Dundee’s most influential supporters group has politely knocked back a bid from Dark Blues owner Tim Keyes to take complete control at Dens Park.Last month it emerged the American millionaire wanted to buy the Dundee FC Supporters’ Society’s ‘A’ Ordinary Shares to take his overall stake in the club to over %.That would have ended the DFCSS’s power of veto over matters like a change of ownership, merger, moving to a new stadium and even substantial borrowing.That’s a condition of the sale of the majority holding Texas-based Keyes took on back in .Only the ‘A’ Ordinary shares that were created then, and are held by the society, include that power of veto.After consulting their -plus members, however, the society have given a thanks but no thanks to the plan for them to be sold.In doing so, however, they have stressed their support “in principal” for the plan to move to a new stadium near the city’s Campderdown Park.And they have stressed their willingness to consider any proposal from Dundee on its merits.The decision of the society’s board reflected the feedback after consulting members.Of that number just over half indicated a preference for holding onto the ‘A Ordinary’ shares but were willing to see a relaxation of certain rights to allow the stadium development to go ahead.Some % were in favour of maintaining the status quo, while % were willing to see the shares sold and a new shareholders agreement negotiated.Another issue is the fact while the existing rules of the DFCSS allow them to buy shares, there is no provision for the sale of any they hold.As well as informing their members, the society board have told Dundee of their decision. It’s one that could leave Keyes and Dundee-based managing director, John Nelms, less than impressed,not surprised.They’ve previously stated the proposed increase in shareholding would have resulted in major tax benefits as they press ahead with the planned Camperdown move.As they informed members and the club of their decision, the society expressed the opinion they’re acting “in the best interests of the society as a whole”.

Increasingly, we want to support people to stop them from getting to that position.”Candidates will be put through a multi-week training course which doubles as an assessment, with an interview at the end of the process to determine their fitness for the work.If accepted, staff will go through a six-week supervised period before becoming fully fledged volunteers.To get involved with the Samaritans, visit www.volunteer.samaritans.org and follow the links to become a listening volunteer."},{"url":null,"title":"search on to find mystery doctor who made aberdeen medical teams day during dundee pitstop","story":"A search is under way to find a mystery off-duty doctor who dug deep to buy sandwiches and coffee for an Aberdeen-based health team who had stopped off for fuel at a petrol station in Dundee on Sunday.Alison Hopkins-Bruce posted on Facebook hoping to find out who he was so she and colleagues can pass on their thanks.Alison said: “Aberdeen Royal Infirmary Ecmo Team were out on a retrieval today… to minimise retrieval time it made more sense to stop and fuel at Dundee on the way.“An extremely kind off duty doctor who was at the till kindly bought us sandwiches and coffee to go!!!“We believe this doctor works at Ninewells in Dundee but we don’t know your name so would like to use social media to show our gratitude and hopefully this thank you will reach you!” []js  d js.id  idjs.src  https:connect.facebook.net en_GB #xfbmlversionv.fjsAberdeen Royal Infirmary Ecmo Team were out on a retrieval today# to minimise retrieval time it made more sense to#Posted by Alison Hopkins-Bruce onSunday,  February "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/02/2.28491657-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/02/2.28491657-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/02/2.28491657-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/02/2.28491657-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"three new areas of aberdeen confirmed for gigabit internet roll out","story":"Internet users in three Aberdeen communities will be the latest to receive the fastest speeds in Scotland.Speeds are expected to reach as high as , gigabytes per second through the CityFibre project.Hilton, Rosehill and Stockethill will be the next areas of the city to be connected to the scheme throughout this month and next.CityFibre has laid ,m of fibre in the ground and passed , homes in the city, with  homes now connected through Vodafone.Kincorth and Northfield were the first places in Scotland to be connected to the network before being rolled out across the city.Allan McEwan, CityFibre’s development manager for Aberdeen, previously said the move marked a “major chapter” in the city’s digital story.He added the scheme would benefit businesses and households."},{"url":null,"title":"a76 roadworks set cause disruption","story":"NewsA roadworks set to cause disruption as Transerv Scotland prepare to close roadRoad chiefs say the work is part of their vital schedule of improvements taking place across the network.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB NewsRoadworks will hit the A this weekend\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDrivers are set for travel misery this weekend as a large part of the south wests road network is resurfaced.Almost km of the A will be treated south of Glenairlie, between Sanquhar and Carronbridge.The work will involve a weekend closure of the road.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide.

But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

Alan McConnell, , admitted the offence when he appeared in Ayr Sherf Court. McConnell was drinking at home with his partner on December  last year. But at some point he left the address, in Prestwick’s Raith Avenue, said depute fiscal Lindzi Bayne. His partner went looking for him at a nearby corner shop, but he had driven off so shop staff contacted police. McConnell’s car was traced to Drongan, and he admitted he had driven there. The charge against him stated he drove on roads between Raith Avenue, Prestwick and Coronation Road, Drongan. A breath test revealed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath. The legal limit in Scotland is  microgrammes. The court heard that McConnell had been ‘just over’ the limit in an earlier drink-driving conviction. Defence lawyer John Gallagher said his client was well aware he could be sent to jail this time. However, he made a plea for a sentence of unpaid work on his client, now of Lane Crescent, Drongan. Sherf John Montgomery told McConnell: “You were driving at five times over the prescribed limit. “If you ever offend again like this, it is inevitable you are going to jail.” He imposed a four-year-driving ban on McConnell, and ordered him to do  hours of unpaid work in the community, within six months. There was another crumb of comfort for McConnell when the sherf refused a Crown motion to seize his car, worth pound.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrCourtsAlcoholDrink-drivingJusticePrestwickAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"retired girvan bank boss admits","story":"NewsRetired Girvan bank boss admits drink-driving offencesNeighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsWilliam Fairbairn is disqualied from the roads for three years\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA retired bank manager was lucky not to be jailed after admitting two drink-driving offences. Neighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Sherf John Montgomery told him: “That would normally mean a custodial sentence. I note your previously unblemished record.” The sherf instead imposed a fine of pound on Fairbairn, and banned him from driving for three years. Depute fiscal Lynda Carnochan described how an anonymous person phoned police on Tuesday afternoon, August , , around .pm. An hour later, police traced a blue Audi car to Rodney Drive in Girvan, and Fairbairn was still in the vehicle. His speech was slurred, said Ms Carnochan. But due to health problems, he struggled to give a breath test.   However, a blood test revealed he had  milligrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of blood, when the legal limit is  milligrammes. Just two months later, on October , , police on mobile patrol saw Fairbairn driving a Vauxhall Corsa. “They were aware of anonymous reports that he was driving while drinking,” said Ms Carnochan. “They followed him into The Avenue, but he did not stop when police flashed lights at him. He then turned into Rodney Drive, and drove past his own address. However he was eventually stopped.” A breath test was this time successful on Fairbairn. And iot showed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath when the legal limit is  microgrammes. Solicitor Hugh Duncan said Fairbairn had retired from the Bank of Scotland in  on a pension of pound per week.   He used his car to visit his -year-old mother, who is resident in a care home, added the lawyer. “The second matter, within such a short space of time, shows there is an issue with alcohol,” Mr Duncan admitted. “His we tells me his drinking is being curtailed. He was hospitalised with a gallstone, and he suffers from COPD.” Sherf Montgomery fined Fairbairn pound on the first charge, with a  months disqualication. He added an pound fine and a three-year disqualication on the second charge. Fairbairn, of Rodney Drive in Girvan, agreed to pay the pound total within  days. His disqualications will run concurrently, making a total of three years, but the Crown made no move to seize the family cars.

meet-up with friends or loved ones - and will also cancel six gatherings entirely over a typical winter because its too cold.Nearly one in two Brits are unable to shake their hibernation instincts when the temperature plummets and spend more time in bed during the winter than any other time of year.Three in  find themselves going to bed earlier as the evenings draw in sooner, and one in eight

snap predicted over the coming weeks,duvets are only going to become even more inviting. At least Brits are taking measures to reduce the struggle, by planning ahead and setting their heating to come on before their alarm."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-swimming-pool-shut-all-evening-after-faecal-incident","story":"A spokeswoman for enjoyleisure, which manages the facility, said: \"Regrettably we had to close the pool at Musselburgh Sports Centre on Monday at short notice around .pm.\"This was following a faecal accident.\"In line with our protocols and health and safety requirements, the pool was closed in order to complete a full treatment cycle.\"We fully appreciate the frustration and disappointment this closure caused however we also know that patrons will understand and accept this approach is necessary in such circumstances.\"The spokeswoman said that the pool reopened at am today .A post from Musselburgh Amateur Swimming Club on Twitter said: \"Session cancelled ndash tonights session is unfortunately not running today due to an issue at the pool.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

He effectively dropped his opposition to her Withdrawal Agreement, which Labour had repeatedly condemned as the ldquoworst of all worlds. The Labour leaderrsquos letter still calls for a customs union, regulatory alignment on trade and guarantees on workers rights and security cooperation. But, crucially, Labour is no longer holding to the ldquosix tests, and insisting a Brexit deal should deliver ldquoexactly the same benefits as being in the single market.Labour has even dropped its opposition to the Irish backstop, which Mr Corbyn condemned, as recently as December, for leaving Britain ldquoin an indefinite halfway house with no say on its future. The explanatory note that Labour circulated after the leaderrsquos letter to May is quite clear. ldquoAny withdrawal agreement,\" it says, ldquowill need to include a backstop.\" Labour is also hinting at further compromises in ldquonegotiations.Hitherto, Labourrsquos policy has been to make demands May could never accept now they are trying to make her an offer she canrsquot refuse.So at last, after months of there being nothing much new to say about Brexit, suddenly we have what looks like a breakthrough, a historic compromise. Of course, you canrsquot overestimate the ability of political leaders to look a gt horse in the mouth. Theresa May may be so wedded to being a ldquobloody dficult womanthat she may find a way to avoid accepting Labourrsquos free hooved mammal. But the deal is there to be made.Senior Tories like Sir Oliver Letwin have welcomed the Labour offer, seeing it as a step towards a Norway-style agreement, even though it isnrsquot. Labourrsquos plan is much closer to Turkey, which is also in a customs union and accepts regulatory alignment. Brussels likes Corbyns proposals too, as a way out of hard Brexit ldquohell.Ive argued that the logic of Labourrsquos position was always to back something resembling Theresa Mayrsquos deal with the EU. It corresponds to Labourrsquos manesto commitments to leaving the EU, including the single market, and ending free movement while seeking frictionless trade. Mrs May has always supported regulatory alignment, since the ldquocommon rule book in her Chequers plan. And the backstop, remember, involves the UK remaining in the customs union until there is a future comprehensive trade deal.In what could almost have been a coordinated intervention last week, Mrs May restated in Dublin her determination to prevent a hard border in Ireland. This put the wind up the DUP, since they fear that the border might now move to the Irish Sea.It didnrsquot appeal to the hardline Brexiteers in her own party either, who are adamant that no deal is better than her bad deal. They thought it had been killed off by last monthrsquos record-breaking Commons defeat ndash but it may now live again with Labourrsquos backing.They canrsquot admit it, of course, but May and Corbyn are now speaking broadly the same language. The customs union, regulatory alignment, rights and protections etc are all matters to do with the future trade relationship with the EU, not the Withdrawal Agreement. It covers only money, citizenship and the Good Friday Agreement.The trading relationship can only be negotiated after Brexit. It is to be hammered out within the up to four years of the transition period, during which the UK remains in the single market and the customs union.Onlythere is no agreement does the backstop comes into play, and that really just extends the transition period indefinitely. May has said she will get assurances that the backstop will be time-limited, but she canrsquot get that from the European Union. If it was limited, it would no longer be a backstop.What hard Brexiteers really fear is that the transition period might lead to a soft Brexit, not a clean break ndash and they are right. What we know is that MPs will block any no-deal Brexit. Hardliners face a choice of May Corbyn or no Brexit at all.To secure a Commons majority without them, Mrs May could promise legislation to keep Britain in regulatory alignment with the customs union until a new trade deal is finalised ndash one which delivers the same benefits. This is anyway implicit in her promises to keep trade ldquofrictionless. Indeed, remaining in a customs union is the only way of achieving this. Up to now, she hasnrsquot been able to say this openly for fear of a rebellion by her hardline backbenchers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. They want a managed no-deal now, or in four years, under the so-called ldquoMalthouse Plan.Butshe has an ounce of political sense, May will now face them down and pivot to Labourrsquos softish Brexit. Labourrsquos demand that she put the customs union in primary legislation can be finessed, because the trade negotiations canrsquot happen until after Brexit.

It is intended to unite Remainers and Leavers, although the latter remain intensely suspicious of another referendum.The police officer leading on Brexit also warned no-deal would make the UK less safe.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin said the inability to check the names of suspected criminals on EU databases as fast meant a ldquoreal risk of people absconding.ldquoEvery fall-back we have is more bureaucratic, it is slower, he saidMrs May is due to update MPs on Wednesday on the progress of talks with Brussels about making changes to the Irish backstop part of her Withdrawal Agreement.With EU leaders refusing to reopen the deal, she is expected to say more time is needed for negotiations, and table a ldquoneutral motion the following day, which Labour wants to amend to force a meaningful vote on February .Accusing the PM of ldquopretending to make progress in order to bounce MPs into backing her deal over no-deal, Sir Keir told the Sunday Times: ldquoWe have got to put a hard stop into this running down the clock.He said: ldquoThere needs to be a day when Parliament says thatrsquos it, enough is enough.He also called Mrs Mayrsquos approach reckless and blinkered, and blamed her ldquotunnel vision for her losing the first meaningful vote on her deal last month by a record  votesldquoItrsquos this blinkered approach thatrsquos got us to where we are, with her never wanting to see where the real majority is in Parliament, he said.In response, the government promised another opportunity to table amendments on February , but failed to commit to a binding vote on the deal itself by the end of the month.Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said: ldquoThat gives that sense of timetable, clarity and purpose on what we are doing with the EU - taking work forward and our determination to get a deal - but equally knowing that role that Parliament very firmly has.LibDem leader Sir Vince Cable said delaying the final vote on the Brexit deal was ldquoworse than irresponsible and said Mrs May ldquofaces a massive rebellion by Conservative MPs.Tory MP Heidi Allen said it was ldquocompletely irresponsible to keep delaying and urged ministers to ldquostep up this week and end the risk of a No Deal Brexit.Mrs May also played for more time in her reply to Labour leader Jeremy Corbynrsquos proposal for a soft Brexit compromise.She said she was ldquonot clear about his call for a customs union, but wanted more talks she rejected his plan for the UK automatically following EU rules on workersrsquo rights and environmental protection, and said Parliament should decide what to follow instead.It came as Tory activists warned Mrs May she would suffer heavy Tory losses in Mayrsquos local elections south of the bordershe committed the ldquounforgivable betrayal of a customs union.Labourrsquos internal problems were highlighted by deputy leader Tom Watson, who admitted he was worried about a breakaway party.He also confirmed Labour was investigating the Liverpool Wavertree branch over the ldquobullying of Jewish MP Luciana Berger, a frequent victim of anti-Semitic abuse.Local pro-Corbyn activists, including one who called Ms Berger a ldquodisruptive Zionist, had tabled no confidence motions in the MP, before withdrawing them last Friday.

When school music lessons are being cancelled, when the pound, cost of providing Christmas trees is a cost my authority can no longer bear or when grass cutting in public spaces becomes an unaffordable luxury, surely that is evidence that all cuts that can be made have been made to \"discretionary\" expenditure and cuts are now being made to the core.Local authorities like West Dunbartonshire, with lots of ground to make up in terms of educational attainment and ameliorating the impact of deprivation are struggling. In West Dunbartonshire the challenge is merely to tread water. The revenue base is low, any increase to the community charge will raise only a tiny fraction of what is required. We canrsquot shrug our shoulders, say itrsquos too hard and move on, or can we The Scottish Greens have done the right thing in agreeing a budget deal that also seeks to establish a better framework for local government finance. The SNP and Labour should recall that at ious times in the past, they promised the same. Labour once had a manesto promise that it would undo a widely criticised and gerrymandered Conservative reorganisation. The smaller, poorer local authorities who lost out in the s re-organisation remain losers today. Itrsquos time for all political parties to put their shoulders to the wheel and agree a solution. Annual hand-wringing and finger-pointing without positive action is worthless.Florence Boyle, Dalnottar Terrace, Old Kilpatrick.THE proposed Workplace Parking Levy is just another backdoor tax for consideration by local authorities . Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has stated that the NHS quite rightly is automatically exempt, but also that only other public service workers such as teachers be considered for exemption too. At what point does someone in office decide on any particular occupation to be prioritised over others  Is the tax to be based on the number of car parking spaces at a workplace whether lying used or vacant, andonly active spaces are in the equation, then the workers just park in the closest free space to their work and no tax is due. Perhaps non-exempt employers should just consider ploughing over their car parks and plant trees to boost our woodland percentage and at the same time avoid this taxWhy are governments not just honest enough to admit to this little wheeze to draw in more cash on the pretext of getting cars off the road and everyone on to our expensive and inefficient public transport system, which may not even service the many workplaces to be affected George Dale, Oakwood Drive, Beith.IT looks overwhelmingly likely that Derek Mackay was forced to make a number of last-minuteconcessions to the Greens to secure passage for his budget. The workplace parking tax has all the appearance of one which was thought through badly,at all.Efforts to reduce car travel to work are sensible in themselves, but measures which penalise some workers, such as those in our health services, who are not all that well paid in the first place and who may have to work awkward and unsocial hours, do more damage than good.This is a good example of a regressive tax that is, one which most badly affects those least able to afford to pay it. As a fair compromise perhaps our government could ensure that, where health workers have to pay to park, the parking vultures are allowed to charge them only as much as they would otherwise have had to pay in additional tax had the parking been free. That might be a little complicated to design and implement, butthe SNP aims to be able to plan and operate a complete tax system following a vote for independence, this might provide some useful and much-needed practice at both.Brian Chrystal, Craiglockhart Road, Edinburgh.SHOULD any council decide that charges be introduced then I assume, in the interests of fairness, that they also ensure that their own employees, from the provost downwards, are charged to park at work.Brian A Bell, Muirpark Road, Kinross.ONE of those phrases which used to be commonplace on BBC Radio Scotland was: ldquoand xxxx in Scotland is being brought into line with England and Wales, where a change was mooted in law or governance.I think of this when we see the farce of a pro-independence party bringing Scotland ldquointo line with England and Wales on workplace parking, and being vehemently challenged by a Unionist party to keep Scotland dferent ndash though these self-same Tories did not like hospital parking charges being eliminated in Scotland, where possible. We also see Murdo Fraser explode with outrage when Scottish local government is given the power to raise local taxes by less than his Tory party are allowing in England .Then we are informed that we Scots should be grateful that our legitimate share of UK taxation is being allowed to come to Scotland, apparently by the benicence of an altruistic Chancellor. We are also told we are not spending our tax receipts correctly, by not having feeson higher education, or chargesfor prescriptions and so on.I think Scotland needs to be gone from this cant and hypocrisy, and have a relationship with England where no one is demeaned or feels obliged to bow and scrape like a Scottish Tory.GR Weir, Mill Street, Ochiltree.SNP politicians were quickly off the mark in criticism of Theresa Mays buying the votes of the DUP.

months, following a fire in the old building back in .Temporary accommodation on site was made for the nursery children.The new library space at Kinellar SchoolThe new school is built on the same site as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others. If this is approved, it will make a massive dference to the town centre, although there will always be some motorists who will take a chance and park there.\"However, Councillor Mackay has misgivings about the extent of the restrictions planned for other parts of Wick.Tuesday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry set to attend Mey games","story":"THE Mey Highland Games is going to ldquoput Caithness in the global spotlight, according to its organiser Captain Richard Otley, after Prince Harry announced he would attend the event this year.Rumours were re last year that Harry and his we Meghan would attend the special event which included para-athletes for the first time but when the royal retinue appeared at pm there was no sign of the couple.Capt Otley believes that the information released over the weekend to the media about Prince Harryrsquos attendance may have come from Buckingham Palace itself.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial. However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost. The site is peaceful, yet vibrant, and supports a thriving marine eco-system. It is both an honour and a privilege to get to know the site.”Full details and further pictures in The Orcadian this week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

Billy Mitchell, a flute band member who amassed  votes when standing for UKIP locally in , appeared previously in Kilmarnock and twice in Stirling, managing to ask a question hostile to the SNP each time. Amazingly, he then managed a fourth appearance in Motherwell and once again was picked to ask a question accusing the SNP of hypocrisy for offering no ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ option during the Scottish independence referendum. Surprisingly though, it wasn’t that robust rant that grabbed the headlines.Instead of featuring his anti SNP question, most papers focused instead on the frequency of Mitchell’s appearance, with the Sun observing it was “a feat so unlikely that bookies would give odds of several thousand to one against it happening.”That’s very signicant.Normally the mainstream media doesn’t register the complaints about bias of the SNP or wider Yes movement. But Mitchell’s presence as a “plant” was so blatant and the online outcry so precisethat no-one could ignore the claim. More problematic for Question Time- no-one wanted to.The stark truth is that the flagship programme of the British Broadcasting Corporation is now less popular amongst tabloid and broadsheet papers, north and south of the border, than a party that wants to leave Britain. That’s quite a feat and doesn’t represent any volte-face over independence by the mainstream media. Rather the press has marked Question Time out as the Weakest Link in the BBC’s current affairs offering.The rot set in quickly after the replacement of David Dimbleby by Fiona Bruce. In episode two, the “neutral” presenter wellied into guest Diane Abbott about Labour’s parlous state in the polls even though the party was level pegging with the Tories. Aunty was then forced to admit Fiona Bruce did refer to Abbott’s ‘personal and political relationships’ in the pre-show warm-up but insisted the presenter didn’t suggest the shadow home secretary got a frontbench role because of her previous closeness to Jeremy Corbyn.Astonishingly, Question Time seems to have got away with that highly unsatisfactory answer… until Motherwell.Scottish eyebrows were already raised at the unionist-heavy composition of the  Michael Forsyth of the Conservatives, Labour’s Anneliese Dodds, the SNP’s Fiona Hyslop, fashion model Eunice Olumide and journalist Hugo Rkind.One question for the SNP is why they let a Cabinet Secretary take part in such a nakedly skewed .My guess is that producers insisted Brexit not independence would be the main subject and thus the balance-demanding political faultline of the night. But independence was bound to come up and although Olumide is apparently a Yes voter– she tweeted later “Wish I had got the chance to say more about Scotland and independence” - Fiona Hyslop found herself isolated and outnumbered when Billy Mitchell was encouraged to hold forth. Olumide was excellent on the question of Liam Neeson and doubtless that’s why she was asked on. But independence needed another sharp-elbowed political operator ready to butt in without permission, because Question Time is a daunting arena in which only politicians and seasoned perfomers really thrive.Not my opinion but that of  year-old Jude Wilkinson who was an audience member some weeks earlier in Winchester“I did not speak up to disagree because speaking out is hard in an environment where unrepresentative audiences thunder applause for absurd arguments.The rush to insert adrenaline into rational debate is destructive to democracy. It is as though debate on matters of national policy is being done in a playground shout the loudest and you will win the argument. It felt utterly intimidating, stepping into the lion’s den.”And in Motherwell it was a highly unrepresentative lion’s den. Leaving the issue of independence to one side, North Lanarkshire like every other council area in Scotland backed Remain . Yet the programme was full of noisy Leave voters. This determination to impose a UK balance on each local audience is Question Time’s biggest problem.Its editors don’t recognise the importance of placewhich means they don’t recognise the reality of local opinion, which means they resort to the tawdry business of bussing in part of the audience almost every week to ensure “balance”. This is a practice the new weekly Scottish Question Time programme should not adopt. If it is broadcasting almost every week, then a genuinely Yes-leaning venue like Dundee can be balanced by visiting a genuinely No-leaning venue like Kelso the following week, achieving neutrality over time and – far more importantly – achieving credibility every week.If BBC Scotland’s new  programme encourages the full ersity of Scotland to be properly heard and explores domestic and international issues in addition to Brexit and independence it’ll be a dead-cert winner. But that now depends entirely on BBC Scotland dumping not tartanising the present, tired UK format. Thanks to Question Time’s recent string of failures on the neutrality front, authenticity is now far more important for the new BBC Scotland programme than aping Aunty to produce pointless screaming matches with imported bams or a dreary sameness. It would also be le-enhancing and politically importantBBC Scotland axed the UK ban on local places raising their own local issues. Worryingly though, it doesn’t look asthis new direction is likely to happen. According to respected health journalist Pennie Taylor, serial audience member Billy Mitchell was in the audience for a pilot episode of the new Question Time, filmed at Edinburgh’s Napier University last week.If true, that is unbelievable and BBC Scotland should admit its mistake. Otherwise the press and public will suspect the new channel is seeking notoriety, sensationalism and confrontation in a desperatye attempot to attract younger viewers. Not good for an important new programme on a publicly-funded new channel.Far better to go where UK Question Time fears to tread, and bring  discussions into the modern world, occupied by intelligent Scots in real places with real and erse political outlooks. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit economic impact british households are 1 500 worse off than before referendum","story":"Households in the UK have taken a #, hit since the Brexit referendum due to higher than expected inflation and stalling economic growth.The average income of homes across the country is £, lower than it had been predicted to be prior to the vote in , in which the UK opted to exit the European Union. window.twttr A new report said that the UK had experienced the sharpest slowdown in income growth of any comparable economy and higher than expected inflation levels – meaning Brits were spending much less than was forecaster.Contrast with the rest of the worldThe study, published by the Resolution Foundation said that households had £, less disposable income on average than they would have had under the Office for Budget Responsibilitypre-referendum forecast.It said that the economic “underperformance” that had been witnessed since  is a “largely UK-specic issue” and that the global performance had actually exceeded expectations.James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Two and a half years since the UK voted to leave the European Union, the country’s post-Brexit position remains far from clear.• : Leave-backing expats in Spain regret their decision as Brexit looms“There has been much discussion about the impact of this uncertainty on businesses, but not enough about its effect on household incomes.“The UK’s stark under-performance on income growth since  – which has tailed off more than other advanced economies – has left UK households taking a £, hit to their living standards.Economic growth has fallen“As we approach Brexit day on  March, politicians in all parties need to recognise how much is at stake for family living standards and that how the country goes forward, not just where it is heading, matters for household incomes in the here and now.”The report corresponded with another announcement from the the Institute for Fiscal Studies which concluded that a no-deal Brexit would leave the UK budget deficit £billion higher over  years thanBritain had stayed in the EU.It said the UK would require an additional two years of the post -style strict austerity measures to plug the gap.Official figures have also shown that, in the final quarter of , the UK’s economic growth slowed as car manufacturing declined.Gross domestic product growth fell to . per cent between October and December, according to the Office for National Statistics, compared with . per cent growth in the previous quarter.Meanwhile, annual GDP increased by . per cent, the weakest it has been since .©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scots health board wins permission to recruit more australian nurses","story":"A Scots health board has won permission to recruit more nurses from Australia, to ease its staffing crisis.NHS Grampian already has  signed up from Down Under.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GAMEKEEPER-SCOTT-MACKENZIE-2.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

faith-based organisation’s new social enterprise shop at Wellington House on the town’s Princes Street. But that is just one aspect of an ambitious multi-phase redevelopment project at the site.“The building had been lying empty for about five years and we are now turning it into a new facility to house everything that the charity does under one roof,” explained Via Wings founder Gail Redmond.Having previously rented premises in the town, the charity worked hard on fundraising projects for several years and received two signicant financial gts which allowed it to buy a building. In  an offer was put in to purchase the former pub, and in September last year they finally moved in to the charity’s new home and began renovations to turn the building into a community facility.

And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project.

It would take a great team to beat his Naomh Éanna side in Championship football this season. On Saturday night, they went toe-to-toe with a fine Kilcummin outfit and came off second best as the Kerry men ran out emphatic -point victors.Central to Kilcummin’s success was the scintillating performance of Kevin McCarthy # who scored a remarkable -, all from play.As his team made their way off the pitch to a remarkable ovation from their large travelling support, the Naomh Éanna boss praised their efforts after a long season which still yielded two Championship titles.“We said coming down here we could live with playing our best and getting beat by a better team. I don’t think we played our best, but we were beaten by a better team,” said Fitzsimons.“Their goalkeeperpulled off two or three great saves and you need to be getting those scores at this level.“They are a super team. I said to the boys at half-time that we were still on the bus. This is a very young side # Eoin Nagle is only  and he was as good as anyone.“There is a bright future in front of those boysthey all stick together and continue to work the way they have been.”In truth, the North Belfast men never really recovered from a nightmare start which saw them concede - inside the first eight minutes with Matt Keane and McCarthy finding the target.A stunning goal from Eoin Nagle kick-started Naomh Éanna’s challenge following a couple of good points from Odhran Eastwood and a Ruairi Scott major on  minutes left just two points between the sides.However, their good work was swtly undone at the other end in a counter attack which halted their progress.Goalkeeper Paddy Flood fouled Noel Duggan as the corner-forward was bearing down on goal following a great pass inside from Seán O’Leary. Referee James Molloy awarded the penalty and issued a black card to Flood for the take-down.To add insult to injury, defender Conor McAuley picked up an ankle ligament injury in the goalmouth scramble which ended his evening.With substitute ’keeper Conor Devlin unavailable due to his soccer commitments with Larne, Michael Morgan donned the number one jersey for the remainder of the contest, but, following a y stoppage, he couldn’t prevent Kieran Murphy from scoring the penalty.With Kilcummin moving into a - to - lead at the break, the Antrim and Ulster champions needed a fast start to the second half, yet an unanswered salvo of - put the game firmly beyond Naomh Éanna. Former Kerry goalkeeper Brendan Kealy pulled off a smart save to deny Kristian Healy early in the half, but current Kingdom ist McCarthy stole the show with some majestic scores.He dovetailed well with the industrious Noel Duggan while Murphy and centre-back Chris O’Leary pushed forward with abandon. As Naomh Éanna continued to chase the game, their defence was exposed.When Healy tested Kealy’s reflexes once again midway through the half, Kilcummin went straight down to the Davin Stand side and with McCarthy splitting the posts in ruthless fashion.With less than  minutes remaining, Kilcummin bagged their fourth major with McCarthy applying the finish following a wonderful move involving Shane McSweeey and Gary O’Leary with McCarthy turning past the advancing Morgan in the Naomh Éanna goal before driving the ball into the net.In injury-time, he completed his hat-trick with his easiest finish of the night after being left unmarked in front of goal to round off a brilliant inidual display.It wasn’t to be for Naomh Éanna, but they’ll quickly turn their attentions to the new season and tonight’s Antrim Championship draws when they will learn who there opponents will be when they make their Senior Football Championship debut later this year.

People still talk about him, and I don’t think there is that much rose-tinted glasses, as there can be when people aren’t about any more, but he was a very successful forward and good goal-scorer, and I remember kicking a ball with him in the back garden and going to games with him.“I remember the house being very busy with phonecalls and taking messages. I also remember going on holidays – we used to go camping every summer – so I have all of those good memories.”He continued: “He was a messer. He would have wound me up, he would have wound my brother and my sister up, and he would have been good fun about the house.“The older I get the more I appreciate it more from doing this type of job – although he would have been doing it in a dferent context than me – but I imagine that it would have brought a lot stress and challenges and I suppose going back to the house and winding the kids up and having a bit of craic was a way to unwind.”John was present with the rest of his family when loyalist gunmen broke into their Fortwilliam Drive home and murdered his father as they sat down to Sunday dinner. The “brutal” murder is still “very clear” to him as it changed his family’s lives forever. The proceeding years would be marked by the campaign for justice as they took on the British state.“I don’t even think I appreciate how taxing the campaign has been,” John admits.“My le growing up has been in the context of making allegations of collusion against the state in a time, from the early s onwards where the word collusion was a dirty word you were a republican propagandist. That was my normality.“It has taken me until my later years to appreciate that my mother was raising three kids, she was going to work and getting children up to get them ready for school, getting breakfast lunch and dinner ready – doing all of that having lost her husband. It has taken me a few years to realise the impact that it had on her, and that makes me appreciate and admire her a lot more than I already did.”Pat Finucane’s case is still under review by The Supreme Court as his family continue to fight for an inquiry. Asked about the signicance of the campaign for other victims of state violence, John said: “Something we have said from the very beginning of our campaign is that this apparatus and this policy that the British state had, which resulted in the deaths and the murders of so many people here, wasn’t just about Pat Finucane. They didn’t set this up just to kill my dad they killed people before him and they killed people after him.“I think it has been an example of what you can achieveyou are persistent and you have that support around you. We weren’t just a family, we had the support of NGOs, we had the support of investigative journalists, we had the support of governments and politicians. Whilst it hasn’t delivered in an inquiry, it has resulted in the word collusion having a very dferent context – people now accept that it happened and there is no longer a ‘few rotten apples in the barrel theory’ and it is no longer ‘republican propaganda’.”He continued: “The support that people have given us over the years, it’s very hard to put that into words. Whether it’s people talking about their memories of my father, people having encouraging words about our campaign, or attending events like this one in St Mary’s, it really provides us so much support.“It’s very humbling and we have always been grateful and we will remain truly grateful for that. My father came from a community that had very little and he wanted to use his education to make people’s lives much better, so for people to come out to remember and pay tribute to him means an awful lot to me and my family.”Sunday’s event will be held at pm in St Mary’s University College, Falls Road."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37803787.ece/77d50/AUTOCROP/w620h342/NILGA.jpg","title":"call for northern ireland councils to be given more powers in absence of stormont","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

NILGA also called for a Brexit Support Found, which has been offered to local authorities in the rest of the UK to the tune of more than £m, to be provided to councils in Northern Ireland.Councillor Dermot Curran, NILGA president, said: “Councils in  are faced with huge expectations on their time and expenditure, in part due to the suspension of the Assembly, Brexit, transfer of responsibilities like event traffic management – costing around £, this year alone to ratepayers – without being offered budgets to deliver.\"Councillor Dermot Curran, President of NILGAHe added: “During the continued political impasse, councils are delivering more with less, taking on major infrastructure work as well as substantial, community led, preventative health work. \"Coupled with the burden of meeting arbitrary targets, councils, the smallest part of the public sector, are being asked to take on more responsibility as the only ing level of government in Northern Ireland, without the offer of additional resources required.”The Stormont Executive collapsed more than two years ago following the resignation of then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, with councils in Northern Ireland operating as the only fullydemocratically elected government in the province.NILGA’s council team met with John Penrose MP, Minister of State in for Northern Ireland, in order to look at how councils’ additional pressures to deliver are funded, as well as forward planning how Northern Ireland’s £ billion public purse is given local, democratic scrutiny until the Assembly s.Derk McCallan, NILGA chief executive, said: \"Due to the current situation, members and chief executives across the  councils are becoming increasingly concerned about their ability to deliver on targets, with the threat of tick box bureaucracy in the background. Enough is enough.“This is why NILGA is calling for devolved political scrutiny of how we as councils are funded, what the deficits are, and enabling a piece of legislation to get us on a proper democratic and value for money footing. These aren’t political or ideological matters, so we can get them sorted. \"Local government elections take place in a matter of weeks and councils should not have to enter a new mandate over-burdened and under-resourced, trying diligently to deliver on many more expectations from a deserving public.Derek McCallan, Chief Executive of NILGA.“This is a reality check and a plea for normality. When our counterparts in England, Wales and Scotland are allocated over £ million in Brexit support, and we are offered an empty purse and a wish list, it’s time to wise up and give councils and communities the tools and the autonomy to get on with it.“Local government is a resilient, democratic anchor in Northern Ireland, but cannot be expected to bare burdens which are sent to us without cash and in a manner which is neither efficient nor necessary. Let’s use these elections to give choice, voice and control to communities, through councils.”"},{"url":null,"title":"catholics to be majority of workforce in northern ireland for first time in 2020 new","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin, the national policing lead for Brexit, did emphasise policing would continue and he didnt believe the UK would become a country of choice for crime gangs.Policing Board member Dolores Kelly said, given Northern Irelands position as having a border with the Republic and with the relationship between the PSNI and An Garda Siochana, there was potential for a  \"criminal justice nightmare\".Assistant Chief Constable Tim Mairs added: “While EU Exit will not adversely affect the deep and embedded culture of collaboration between PSNI and An Garda Siochana, it is accepted that losing access to these tools will present us with challenges.

However, unionist councillors voted down the motion, which would also have resulted in a council presence at the annual Belfast Pride Parade in August. Members of the DUP and Ulster Unionists rejected the plan and said they would not be taking lectures on equality from Sinn Fein. Last August, Sinn Fein spearheaded an attempt to fly rainbow flags on the councils premises to show support to LGBTQ+ citizens during Pride.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon was set to make history by becoming the first council in Northern Ireland to fly the Pride flag above its three civic buildings.But the DUP invoked the call-in mechanism, which allows decisions to be reconsideredat least % of councillors request it.The DUP said strict procedures on flying flags and emblems hadnt been followed properly.The council then sought legal advice, which both the DUP and Sinn Fein claimed justied their stance. The row meant Pride Day last August passed without the flags in place. People taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper PA WireSinn Fein council group leader Darren McNally told the Ulster Gazette newspaper it was disappointing but not surprising that both unionist parties had voted against lighting up the civic buildings. He said: \"We have a erse community and the onus is on us to ensure we not only represent minority groups such as our LGBT community but that we make them feel valued, included, welcome and safe. \"Lighting up the civic buildings on Pride Day and an official presence at the parade is a forward-moving gesture - small but signicant - which would send out a clear message that ABC council are here for our LGBT community at a time when they are subject to hate attacks and left feeling isolated. \"In amending our original motion of the flying of the Pride flag, we were recognising that some parties are on a journey with regards to this particular issue. Other unionist councillors have supported similar motions in other councils.\"However, UUP councillor Jim Speers hit out at what he called the \"mischievous\" motion. He said: \"Sinn Feins actions go counter to the good working relationships we need at ABC Council. \"They are the last party that should be giving lectures on the need for equality. For a party which was linked to an organisation which terrorised this community for over  years to be talking about equality is disgusting.\"The DUPs Gareth Wilson accused Sinn Fein of \"blatant electioneering\". He added: \"Given the ious and well publicised anti-DUP messages associated with the event in question, our party grouping decided unanimously to decline support for this latest Sinn Fein motion.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"westminster to prevent may from running down brexit clock says starmer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The critical question is, is she, in her response, indicating a willingness to drop her red lines or not and that’s what needs to be tested sooner rather than later.“The critical thing is which direction is the Prime Minister heading in. Is she firstly trying to get her own team back on board to put her deal yet again with some supposed changes, and that’s what looks like she is doing, or is she genuinely looking to see a majority for Labour’s proposal of a customs union single market alignment.”He also expressed concerns over the backstop arrangement and in particular the customs arrangements for England, Scotland, Wales saying they “aren’t as good as they should be”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has been visiting Belfast He added: “I am concerned that with  days to go the Prime Minister is simply running down the clock, mindful that the next EU Summit is March  andshe’s is trying to run the clock down Parliament has to step in with a hard stop to say we are not going to accept that.”When asked his view on Labour Party colleagues calling for a second referendum, Sir Keir said: “I say we have got a conference motion on this, we agreed in advance what we would do and we tried to foreshadow the decisions we would have to make and we thought we would have to vote on a deal first,the deal goes down there would be a general election.“If there can’t be a general election then options including a public vote should be on the table. That’s what the Labour Party agreed and we agree unanimously and I think there is a good deal of support for that in the Labour Party.”Sir Keir met with representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which represents workers across the island of Ireland, before he spoke with Ireland’s Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.Owen Reidy, the union’s assistant general secretary, said that workers on the island of Ireland cannot be “collateral damage” in Brexit.Mr Reidy said: “It’s really important that a consensus is built across the House of Commons but a credible consensus that also gets the assent and agreement of the EU. That’s the critical issue here.“Our view is Theresa May should look across the benches at the Labour Party and reach the softest possible Brexit and jettison the ERGand try and make accommodation with Keir Starmer and his colleagues who it seems to me are announcing a very soft Brexit with a UK-wide customs union and a close alignment with the single market. We welcome thatthere has to be a Brexit.“We’re very concerned because a hard Brexit is going to create as situation where WTO tarfs which are on average % so it’s going to lead to increases in costs for businesses and it’s going to lead to increases in cost for consumers and that’s going to hit workers,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"dial down rhetoric and language focus on solutions says dups dodds as brexit deal returns to parliament","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Arlene Foster called for \"cool heads\".Over the weekend there was anger after both Tony Blair and John Major warned leaving the EU without a deal risked damaging the peace process.Nigel Dodds said: \"Some of the language and rhetoric employed last week was not conducive to making progress and securing the agreement we all want to see. Whether it is the European Council or former UK Prime Ministers, it’s time to dial down the rhetoric and focus on solutions rather than scaremongering.\" Read MorePM to update Commons on Tuesday on progress in Brexit talksDUP MP urges Blair and Major to dial down Brexit rhetoric over peace threatDonald Tusk branded a ‘devilish, trident wielding, euro maniac’ by DUP MPWestminster to prevent May from running down Brexit clock, says StarmerThis week parliament will again debate leaving the EU. An amendment is set to be tabled requiring the Commons to have another \"meaningful vote\" on the deal on the table by February . There is concern among parliamentarians the Prime Minister may be \"running down the clock\" in order to force her deal through.North Belfast MP Dodds said the focus had to be on tackling the backstop, saying it was the \"central problem\". \"The Prime Minister has committed to securing legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement. Those changes will be required for Parliament to support any deal. The EU cannot continue to hark back to a proposed deal which was comprehensively rejected by the House of Commons. There is no agreement without Parliament’s support.\"He added: \"Over the next number of weeks the options will become increasingly clear, particularly for the European Union. If the political will is there then an agreement can be achieved. The alternative is to cling to an unacceptable backstop which actually increases the chances of an outcome it was supposedly designed to prevent. It can make no sense for anyone to continue pursuing such a perverse policy.”Meanwhile the EU published a -page presentation on the withdrawal agreement breaking down the deal with the UK. The DUP said it highlighted the \"threat the proposed backstop poses to our economy and to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom\".MEP Diane Dodds said it showed how EU leaders had \"buried their heads in the sand\". She added:\"It is time to change direction before it is too late. It is time to work for a better deal. A deliverable deal which builds on the aspects of the draft treaty that we can all agree are positive whilst addressing genuine concerns over the Irish border in a pragmatic way. That should be our collective vision in the days ahead.”"},{"url":null,"title":"iranian couple given leave to remain in the uk","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is the case whether there is a soft or hard Brexit.“The response that is needed is one that while cognisant of our EU responsibilities, nonetheless addresses the singular problems facing Ireland – namely the threat Brexit poses to exporters, the all-island economy, the Good Friday Agreement, and the border.“We believe in a dual strategy for dealing with a no-deal Brexit.“The first is to mitigate its effects in the short-term through state measures, and second to overcome the disruption through medium to long-term investment in capital and social infrastructure.“Brexit does not just affect business – it affects communities and people as well.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Any Brexit strategy worth its salt needs to reflect and address this reality. This holds whether there is a deal or not.“Finally, the people of the north must be given a say in their own future – either it is with an isolated and inward–looking Britain or it is with a reunied Ireland. Brexit puts a border poll – a referendum on Irish unity – firmly on the agenda.“There is a need for direct government support for those importers and exporters that trade exclusively with Britain.“The vast majority of these businesses are small to medium-sized enterprisesand as such are lacking the scale of resources to easily change practices that were many years in the making – and to do so before the end of March .“Sinn Féin believes that a €bn Brexit stabilisation fund should be established, that rights of workers at risk of a Brexit ‘race to the bottom’ should be strengthened, and that the Irish government must prepare for a referendum on Irish unity following Brexit.“This should be used to invest in much-need infrastructure, in roads, ports, rails, public transport, housing, health, and education.“We need a plan that is directed at the issues facing Ireland, not just those facing the EU.\"Deputy Cullinane concluded: “This document is Sinn Féin’s contribution to this process.” Sinn Féins Brexit contingency proposals can be accessed at https:www.sinnfein.ie files  DC_Brexit_Document_Jan_.pdf"},{"url":null,"title":"crossgates nursery little acorns celebrates estyn success","story":"Little Acorns Children Nursery, Crossgates near Llandrindod Wells have had a gooltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtd Estyn Report..Pictltspan classtruncate-full-screengtured are children from Little Acorns and back left to right, Amanda Baylissand Becky Pritchard .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Little Acorns nursery #thrilled# with latest Estyn reportLittle Acorns Children Nursery, Crossgates near Llandrindod Wells have had a gooltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtd Estyn Report..Pictltspan classtruncate-full-screengtured is Becky Pritchardwith Bobby Watkins and Mylah Drew..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" Little Acorns nursery #thrilled# with latest Estyn reportLittle Acorns Children Nursery, Crossgates near Llandrindod Wells have had a gooltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtd Estyn Report.Pictultspan classtruncate-full-screengtred are children from Little Acorns and back left to right, Amanda Baylissand Becky Pritchard Picture by Phil Blagg.PB--lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"colour codes 2019 llandrindod wells cp school most improved","story":"Llandrindod Wells Cefnllys Primary School..Pictured left to right, Hayley Smith ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt Karen Jenkinsand Lorraine Cadwallader-Jones .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"COLOUR CODES: Cefnllys Primary School is the most improved in PowysLlandrindod Wells Cefnllys Primary School..Pictured left to right, Lorraine Cadwltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtallader-JonesKaren Jenkinsand Hayley Smith .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" COLOUR CODES: Cefnllys Primary School is the most improved in PowysLlandrindod Wells Cefnllys Primary School..Pictured are members of the school coltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuncil..Picture by Phltspan classtruncate-full-screengtil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" COLOUR CODES: Cefnllys Primary School is the most improved in PowysLlandrindod Wells Cefnllys Primary School..Pictured left to right, Hayley Smith ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt Karen Jenkinsand Lorraine Cadwallader-Jones .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"aurora like airglow in the sky above the elan valley near rhayader as meteor passes by","story":"A meteor enters the earth#s atmosphere over the snowy hills of the Elan Vallltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtey in Powys while etltspan classtruncate-full-screengthereal green #airglow# spreads across the sky.

Hannaway reflected upon the organisationrsquos work over the past year during the annual rates meeting.He said the organisation continued to deliver on both the services and key projects that were agreed in its current four-year corporate plan which ends in , working to improve the local authorityrsquos recycling rates, both for blue and brown bin collections, reducing the amount of waste going to landfill by %.Mr Hannaway said the council was also delighted to open the new poundm Down Leisure Centre which he described as a ldquosignature project that will make a real contribution to improving citizensrsquo health and wellbeing.ldquoWe are even more ambitious for the coming year, with the agreement on funding for the Belfast Region City Deal, we have plans for a new conference and theatre facility in Newry City, the delivery of the Southern Relief Road and a -year programme of economic growth, the chief executive continued.ldquoThe reopening of the Warrenpoint Municipal Park in August and the opening of the Carlingford Lough Greenway from Newry to Victoria Lock in July demonstrate our councilrsquos commitment to improving our arearsquos attractions and environment.Mr Hannaway said that in the coming year Newry and its Cathedral Corridor would see pound, for improvements, festive lighting and events, to building on what has already been achieved in these locations.His focus also turned to Brexit, explaining that as the March  deadline for leaving edges ever closer, the councilrsquos relationships with government departments, the EU, cross border bodies and institutions across Ireland and Britain will become even more important as it seeks to improve the district.ldquoThese partnerships will remain a priority for the coming year as we deliver initiatives, programmes and services for all the people living, working and investing in our district, he continued.ldquoSome of the projects that will be progressed during the   year include further revitalisation of Warrenpoint, with pound, for town improvements, including shop fronts, new signage and a promotional and marketing campaign.ldquoThe council has also secured approval for the Ballynahinch bypass, a plan that will greatly improve access throughout the area and relieve the traffic congestion in the town centre.Mr Hannaway said plans for the southern relief road in Newry will be progressed after the preferred route was announced and was confident that developing a strategic link road between the A Dublin Road and the A Warrenpoint Road mdash a project that the council is working on with Stormont officials ndash will contribute to increasing the economy of the whole region.He said improving public services and the way they were implemented was another important goal for the council in the new financial year, revealing that five ambitious performance improvement objectives had been identied.They include encouraging healthy lestyles, improving economic growth and promoting the district as a premier tourist destination, delivering urban and rural regeneration initiatives, creating a cleaner, greener district, and encouraging and empowering local communities to work with the Council to deliver on its programmes.ldquoOver the coming months, the council will be working with local groups to ensure that their views on how best to implement these important goals, he confirmed.ldquoOver the coming year, the historic town of Downpatrick will benefit from a new public realm improvement scheme as part of the Masterplan which will be delivered in partnership with the Department for Communities and the Department for Infrastructure.Mr Hannaway said the district continued to benefit from EU funding, with pound.m being provided to South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which promotes economic growth and job creation in coastal and inland communities.Under the PEACE IV programme pound.m had been allocated to the council to deliver the Local Authority Action PlanmdashBeyond Tolerance in the three key areas of children and young people, shared spaces and services, and building positive relationships.Projects funded under this initiative include an archaeological dig near Down Cathedral which will help provide more information on the legacy of St Patrick and a cross-community choir aimed at establishing and developing new

the table to nine points when they condemned Killough to the also rans category at The Links, Strangford on Saturday.Killough, who have been forced go play their home games anywhere they can as the Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

He has a proud direct lineage to the band when it first started out  years ago. His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan. No doubt his youngest, one year-old Alexandra, will be drafted in a few years time.Piper Ryan Green, who used to play for the former Seaforde and Woodgrange Pipe Bands, has also introduced his  year-old son, Matthew, while piper Robert Neill plays alongside his  year-old daughter Laura.Sometimes the pull towards piping and Hollymount misses a generation. However, the family influence remains strong as in the case of siblings Jessica and Thomas Watson, whose great grandfather, David Stranney, was in the band, although their parents werenrsquot.But the members know that keeping the band going for the next generation is an even greater challenge today than it was  years ago.They are delighted that it currently has  members aged  and under in the band.Apart from marching in the annual Twelfth celebrations, the main activity for the band is performing at local concerts where it has raised more than pound, in recent years for charities.Sam Gill says that the next big push, once some of the younger members are ready for it, will be to start competing in contests again, although they know it may take some time to reach their former B grade.ldquoTherersquos still a hunger to try and get the band to be as good as possible. The problem we have mdash and any band will tell you the same mdash is trying to keep the young ones interested becauseyou donrsquot, they will leave, he added.ldquoBands like ours are often recruitment bands for other larger ones but we would dearly love to see more experienced band members joining Hollymount and passing on their experience to the next generation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Contractors continue with leisure centre demolition  ","story":"WORK is progressing at pace to demolish the old Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick.Contractors are razing the old building to the ground as its poundm replacement continues to break membership records, with additional staff drafted in to cope with the volume of people coming through the doors.Four decades after the old centre opened, it is being reduced to a pile of rubble as the soaraway success of its ultra-modern replacement continues, with users flocking in their droves and membership doubling within a week.The old centre was the first major leisure complex built in the district and was one of the most modern of its kind when the doors opened for business, boasting a new swimming pool and a suite of other facilities, including a large sports hall.Contractors in charge of the demolition began work shortly before Christmas and over the past few weeks have made signicant progress.The old sports hall has been razed to the ground with contractors currently using heavy equipment to demolish the old swimming pools and reception area.The old centre was a major community hub and in addition to meeting the districtrsquos leisure needs, the large hall hosted many community events including public rallies, former Down Council election counts, drama productions and even concerts featuring a host of local artists.While the centre had long since passed its sell-by-date, the former Down Council was keen to replace it and the work the local authority started was completed by its successor, Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The old centre closed for the final time at the end of November,  years after it opened.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU. However, the uncertainty is very damaging.ldquoWith March  less than  days away decisions need to be taken urgently and a deal agreed. Leaving the EU without a deal would be catastrophic for Northern Irelandrsquos farming families and their businesses.ldquoNo deal means high tarfs on our exports creating an effective trade embargo and the possibility of lower standard imports flooding the UK market.ldquoThese practical issues will have an immediate and profound impact on farmers, causing major disruptions to the supply chain, crippling the industry and rendering our farmers uncompetitive..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 6%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch headmaster hit out at the education authorities this week for the lack of permanent accommodation at his school where two thirds of the pupils are in wooden huts.Mr Harry Bent said St Colmanrsquos High School had been promised a major extension, but was unlikely to get it ldquoas long as comprehensive education is the policy of the Government.Speaking at the schoolrsquos annual prize day, Mr Bent said it angered him that the provision of accommodation had not kept pace with the growing numbers and successes of pupils.ldquoIn St Colmanrsquos nine temporary classrooms accommodate  pupils out of a total of , he said. ldquoThis means that almost two thirds of our pupils are in temporary accommodation which was first erected as a temporary measure ten years ago.Mr Bent stressed temporary classrooms may solve a financial problem for the Government, but there was so substitute for normal school accommodation.ldquoAt least  of the  subjects on the secondary curriculum are practical subjects, such as domestic science.

Those players made a signicant dference, he said afterwards.ldquoWe knew we had to get something from the game, Tally continued. ldquoWe lost last week and we were disappointed with our performance. Wersquove still a lot of work to do. We made a lot of mistakes and conceded a lot of turnovers.ldquoThere are boys still finding their feet at this level, which is part of it.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

He has no doubt that they will be relieved to hear that the scheme is definitely going ahead.He continued: ldquoI had wanted an extra filter lane to be provided, but due to the extensive underground utilities, the cost to relocate them would have delayed the installation of the puffin crossings.ldquoIn the interests of public safety, it is essential to push on with the committed works to provide the new puffin crossings before the end of March.ldquoI would like to thank roads officials for listening to the concerns of the Newcastle community and delivering on this important road safety priority.Last year, a new plan to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout in response to mounting local concern was outlined.Roads officials plan to create a new dedicated filter lane, enabling drivers entering the resort from the Dundrum direction and wishing to access the Castlewellan Road to do so without causing major tailbacks, leaving two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the town centre.It is understood officials have not yet fully costed the scheme, but they have confirmed they will require to shave off a section of land at the side of the roundabout to provide the new link road which they are confident can signicantly reduce congestion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle trio are nice and Trim  ","story":"FOR those preparing for a Spring Marathon, the Trim  Mile Road Race is the first opportunity to see how January training has gone and the progress made towards achieving whatever your goal might be.This has been a popular event among the NAC faithful in the past and the bus full of lsquomaybesrsquo was reasonably full last year.This year, the event proved more popular than ever and sold out in early January.

He said the review will not be completed until December.Cllr Curran said Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie were at the heart of their respective communities and that new investment was required to allow them to develop.ldquoWhile I welcome the planned review, I am concerned at how long it will take to complete. In addition, how will any recommendations around future investment for example be implemented in the absence of a ing Stormont Assembly  he asked.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to make pound, to assist with plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour, helping secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry.The local authority is making the cash available to the recently formed Ardglass harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals to help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ardglass.The money has been earmarked to help the new group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use.Cllr Curran said many people were eager to read the conclusions of the government departmentrsquos review, particularly in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.He added: ldquoAt this point in time all those within the fishing sector in particular are looking at the ongoing discussions around Brexit and wondering what any final decision will have on an already heavily regulated industry.Meanwhile, Ardglass Golf Club is the venue for a special event next Wednesday, February , when funding opportunities under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund support programme will be outlined during an information session which runs between am and .pm.The funding initiative is designed to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth through job creation and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture.This includes the ersication of activities within fisheries and into other sectors of the maritime economy with the pound.m funding cake being administered by the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which comprises representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors within the Newry, Mourne and Down and Ards and North Down council areas.The projects eligible for financial support must must demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s James and Kirsty dance to success  ","story":"YOUNG farmers from all over Co Down descended upon a Belfast hotel recently for this yearrsquos star-studded grand final of Strictly Young Farmers.More usually associated with Simmentals and Shorthorns the Strictly contestants showed they were equally at home with a good salsa or a samba on stage at the Crown Plaza Hotel in a bid to win the much revered glitter ball.The event sponsored by Barclays, saw Young Farmersrsquo clubs from all over Co Down welcome a crowd of over , made up of sponsors, family and friends, to support this yearrsquos dancers.The enthusiastic audience were dazzled with a vast array of steps and styles including the cha cha cha, jive, charleston, paso doble and American smooth.In preparation for the big night the committed couples underwent a strict regime every Monday evening since last November.Following much swinging, sweat and a lot of fake tan the couples were well able to showcase their talent at the annual event to raise funds for Alzheimerrsquos Society and local Young Farmersrsquo clubs.The event was hosted by past YFCU president Roberta Simmons, of Rathfriland YFC, past YFCU vice-president Harry Crosby, of Spa YFC, and current YFCU vice-president Andrew Patton, from Newtownards YFC.Assisting with the eveningrsquos entertainment were judges Karen Patterson from the BBC and past Young Farmer, James Trotman, Agri Manager for Barclays, Janet Plunkett, Fundraising Manager for Alzheimerrsquos Society in Northern Ireland, and Zita McNaugher, current YFCU deputy president.Competing couples George Porter and Laura Sproule, Matthew Ney and Rebecca Nelson, Chris Reid and Sarah Robinson, Harry Walker and Emma Connolly, James Gilpin and Emma McAnea, Ward Patterson and Sarah Reid, Richard Kennedy and Jessica Lee, Harry Hamilton and Louise McAnea, Graham Annett and Sarah Graham wowed the crowd with their twinkle toes.However, it was James McCauley and Kirsty Burrows, from Spa YFC, who danced their way to the top with their energetic charleston to be crowned Strictly winners .The organising committee, led by Co Down YFC chairperson Linzi Stewart and secretary Kristina McKeag, thanked everyone who helped make the night such a success, particularly sponsors, hosts, judges, family and friends and last but not least the dancers, who were the stars of the show..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17407264.special-screening-in-memory-of-david-johnston/resources/images/9393448.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

Thus, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland becomes a land border between the UK and the EU.Letter to the editorIronically, between % and % of the Republic of Ireland’s goods travel to Great Britain, either for consumption there or moving on to other EU or world destinations. Therefore, the land border only deals with comparatively small volumes of goods. It might be useful to put this in perspective as compared to total EU goods flows.The EU statistical agency, Eurostat, stated in January  that the total value of Intra-EU trade in goods in  was €, billion. On th December , the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency stated that in  the value of goods exported to the Republic from Northern Ireland was €. billion. Consequently, Northern Ireland’s exports to the Republic represented .% of EU trade in goods in . This was equivalent to .% of the Republic’s total imports from the world in  Of course I fully understand and appreciate that €. billion is a huge deal in terms of Northern Ireland’s economy but the fact remains that when local cross border trade is assessed against the total volume of EU trade, it seems utterly bizarre that such a relatively modest amount should be threatening to derail negotiations affecting €, billion — a thousand times as much — right across the continent, from Lisbon to Latvia. Of course there will be goods in transit and there is potential for some unscrupulous traders to try and subvert the single market, but there are ways of dealing with that. For example, the UK could create an offence for anyone to export goods to the EU which are not compliant with EU standards.Geography is also a protection as it is expensive and obvious to be moving goods around these islands especiallyferry crossings are involved. I believe the Withdrawal Agreement is a sledgehammer to crack a relatively small — although crucial and politically sensitive — nut and serious discussions need to be taking place to negotiate an alternative. It’s all politics now and the exchanges and comments of Donald Tusk and Leo Varadkar have poisoned the atmosphere further. If they have nothing constructive to say they would be better to stay silent.Two pupils deserve credit for even trying Chinese, let alone doing well in it Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Lord Empey, House of LordsJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      Lord Empey: Withdrawal Agreement backstop is a sledgehammer to crack a relatively small nutIf you leave a customs union, naturally you cannot expect to have the same rights and privileges as an existing member.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We certainly hope so.The border debate got most of the attention, but it is just part of a major spending measure to fund a bevy of Cabinet departments.A collapse of the negotiations would have imperilled another upcoming round of budget talks that are required to prevent steep spending cuts to the Pentagon and domestic agencies.Workers prepare for a President Donald Trump campaign rally at El Paso County Coliseum Mr Trump travelled to El Paso, Texas, for a campaign-style rally on Monday night focused on immigration and border issues.He has been adamant that Congress approve money for a wall along the Mexican border, though he no longer repeats his  mantra that Mexico will pay for it.Democrats carried more leverage into the talks after besting Mr Trump on the -day shutdown but showed flexibility in hopes on winning Mr Trumprsquos signature.After yielding on border barriers, Democrats focused on reducing funding for detention beds to curb what they see as unnecessarily harsh enforcement by Immigration and Customs Enforcement .The agreement yielded curbed funding, overall, for ICE detention beds, which Democrats promised would mean the agency would hold fewer detainees than the current average of , detainees held each day. Democrats claimed the number of beds would be ratcheted down to ,.But a proposal to cap at , the number of detainees caught in areas away from the border mdash a limit Democrats say was aimed at preventing overreach by the agency mdash ran into its own Republican wall.Will be heading to El Paso very soon. Big speech on Border Security and much  tonight. Tremendous crowd! See you later!mdash Donald J. TrumpFebruary , Democrats dropped the demand in the Monday round of talks, and the mood in the Capitol improved markedly.Mr Trump met on Monday afternoon with top advisers in the Oval Office to discuss the negotiations. He softened his rhetoric on the wall but ratcheted it up when alluding to the detention beds issue.ldquoWe can call it anything. Wersquoll call it barriers, wersquoll call it whatever they want, Mr Trump said. ldquoBut now it turns out not only donrsquot they want to give us money for a wall, they donrsquot want to give us the space to detain murderers, criminals, drug dealers, human smugglers.The recent shutdown left more than , government workers without pay, forced postponement of the State of the Union address and sent Mr Trumprsquos poll numbers tumbling..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Congressional US politicians reach deal on border wall funding article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The feasibility studies, commissioned by ABC Council and facilitated by AECOM, will involve necessary participation from landowners and the general public.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house_11.jpg","title":"future of house of fraser in belfast secured amid fresh lease","story":"Posted on Friday February  by John Mulgrew The future of House of Fraser in Belfast appears to be safe after the retailer signed a fresh lease on its anchor store at Victoria Square, it can be revealed.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.

Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
