coronavirus rule-breakers after Matt Hancock suggested people will still be banned from hugging their relatives. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said \u0027the police have lots of other things to be doing\u0027 and she will not be \u0027encouraging my people to be barging through people’s doors or knocking on people’s doors\u0027.However, she warned officers will be prepared to intervene if they are made aware of flagrant breaches of the restrictions which are \u0027causing lots of concerns with the neighbours\u0027. Her comments came as Mr Hancock poured cold water on the prospect of a major loosening of curbs over the festive period as he said he wants a UK-wide set of rules \u0027if at all possible\u0027. The Health Secretary said negotiations are ongoing between the four home nations as they try to hammer out proposals which would allow people to travel to see their family. But there is likely to be an uphill battle to agree terms given the dramatically different lockdown approaches which have been taken by England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in recent months. There had been hopes of a massive easing of draconian restrictions to allow people to celebrate Christmas with their loved ones. But Mr Hancock dampened those hopes as he said \u0027it of course won\u0027t be like a normal Christmas\u0027 and \u0027there will have to be rules in place\u0027.    He also insisted people will still be required to adhere to social distancing regardless of what other measures may be changed.Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter, a leading statistician at the University of Cambridge, said any easing of rules will undoubtedly come with extensive Government guidance which he suggested could include a ban on singing as he also joked: \u0027Maybe they will try to make a rule against family rows at Christmas.\u0027 If the Government goes ahead with plans to loosen rules at Christmas it will have to contend with the anger of scientists and medics who say the virus will be just as dangerous then as on any other day.Katherine Henderson, president of Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said Christmas should be treated as just another ‘date in the month’ this year, adding: ‘If Covid cases become hospital cases and then sadly go on to become deaths, we will regret a Christmas season that gave granny Covid for Christmas.’ Professor Andrew Hayward, a member of the Government’s scientific committee Sage, said that allowing family gatherings would create a ‘substantial risk’ of new infections. ‘My personal view is we’re putting far too much emphasis on having a near-normal Christmas,’ he told Radio 4’s Today programme.‘We know respiratory infections peak in January, so throwing fuel on the fire over Christmas can only contribute to this.’ And Professor Gabriel Scally, a public health expert from Bristol University, said there was ‘no point’ in having a merry Christmas only to ‘bury friends and relations in January and February’. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/21/4EA14C6500000578-0-image-a-5_1532724650162.jpg","title":"Gordon Ramsays father law bankruptcy extended four years","story":"Share

walk locked down artists showing work in their windows","story":"Galleries are closed due to Covid – so a group of artists have taken to displaying their work from their houses for passersby. Our writer takes to the streetsIt is not a good time for art lovers. The second lockdown has closed galleries once more – I’m imagining portraits waiting moodily in the National Gallery in London to be admired again Van Gogh’s sunflowers wilting further – and so it is not a good time for artists.Artists Walk is an initiative that aims to improve that state of affairs. It’s a simple idea for an art trail that began as a joint endeavour between printmaker and painter Rosha Nutt, and her art marketing consultant friend Holly Collier. Those who in normal times would be exhibiting in galleries or community spaces can now place their work in the windows or surroundings of their homes for passers-by to admire. Kind of like “how much is that doggy in the window?” Except that it might be that Picasso sketch of his dachshund.In March, just before the first lockdown, Nutt and Collier curated an exhibition in London that featured Jeremy Deller and Ben Wilson. #FakeNews also had workshops and talks and was the success of these that gave Nutt and Collier the confidence to establish Artists Walk.“Lockdown was the catalyst,” Collier tells me. “So many artists have moved studios into their homes. Exhibitions and events have been cancelled. It’s pretty depressing being an artist who can’t show work. We wanted to do something that had a positive action, a way to connect with the local community and something fun to do.”Until 14 December, London artists working in whichever medium – painters, photographers, illustrators, film-makers, ceramicists and more – can pay £15 to have their location added to the “interactive map” on the website, as well as a short bio and links to the artists’ website and social media profiles, plus a custom poster.Collier and Nutt pulled the whole thing together in seven weeks. “It’s been late nights, early mornings and a lot of elbow grease,” Collier says. They applied unsuccessfully for an Arts Council grant, but local collectives and businesses stepped in. An estate agent became a sponsor and organised a leaflet drop. Alexandra Palace – usually home to concerts and comedy gigs – lent its support, including what amounts to a quasi window-residency.Collier tells me there has been an enthusiastic response to the scheme 115 artists have signed up. So I set off, phone in hand, around north London (Artists Walk is designed for London, though creatives have registered as far away as Wales).About that “interactive map”. It is not so interactive. It keeps deciding I am in Clerkenwell, four miles away. But I plough on, undeterred. Well, maybe a little.On the way, I take in the everyday detail and aesthetic pleasures of the streets. The gorgeous stained glass and children’s painted rainbows that are their own window art a set of bollards that someone has graffitied in bright colours. The 1930s sculpted panels by Arthur Ayres that make for one of my favourite buildings in the Crouch End area – even though it is now a Barclays branch.I arrive at the painter Sarah Barker Brown’s house, her large bay windows displaying oil canvases of two swimmers wearing bathing caps a black-and-white portrait of a woman with wonderful cheekbones and afro a couple embracing. Light bouncing off pairs of lithe legs. A self-portrait. Brown’s husband opens the door and through their garden I can see the artist in her studio.Brown has won prizes and exhibited in galleries around London. So how does the Artists Walk experience compare?“It is a nice thing. Usually, I’d participate in the Crouch End Open Studios” – in which local artists open their homes and studios to exhibit and show to prospective buyers – “but that was cancelled this year. I have found the lockdowns difficult, especially at first. I was a bit sort of: ‘What am I doing?’ What really got me out of that was I painted a portrait of my friend, who is a nurse, in full protective gear. And that reconnected me. Now I am enjoying painting for me. There is a bit more space and time.”There is a brilliant painting entitled One Last Swim, made before the Hampstead Ladies’ Pond locked down again last month. Another of two women enjoying the sun during the lead-up to the hot, sticky summer when, for some, lolling about outside was all there was to do.Brown has noticed people stop and look, she says. As if to prove her point a woman and her young daughter comment “They’re beautiful”) as they pass. Then Maureen Harrison, another artist involved in the scheme, appears.“It’s a great idea and affords people a different experience during their daily walks,” Harrison, whose work mostly focuses on changing urban landscapes and city spaces, says of the project. “It does mean that those who would be reluctant to set foot in a gallery can still view contemporary art, and others can get their fix.”There are issues, however. Harrison is having problems with glare on her windows, which are high up. (One of Brown’s sons is at university and the other – being a teen – “basically has his blinds shut all the time”. So it has worked out pretty well, window-wise, for her.) There’s also the wet weather.I pass three other displays. One is the house of mixed-media artist Caroline Bettaney whose high dynamic range photographs of Scottish lochs contrast with bright pop art (I later learn this house is used often used a film location). The second is the glass front of Lisa-Marie Price’s studio. Price crushes rocks and stones to make the paint for her abstract watercolours that focus on the environment. Her works are the most at home.And finally as the darkness moves in, Kamala Harris and Marcus Rashford greet me from the windows of Alison Meek’s house. The portrait of Harris – though partially obscured by a reflection of branches and smiling out at parking spaces and council bins – is particularly striking and heartening.Is the Artists Walk a success? Yes. It is bringing people together and reminding us of the arts we used to enjoy when zoom was just a verb. But it’s also quite a disheartening rendition of the real thing. It’s a bit like breaking up with someone – you’d rather not see them for a bit if it’s not going be how it was.Artworks such as these aren’t made for this habitat and I kept getting distracted by the art, intentional or not, that is all around us and which does fit. Not just those stained glass windows, but the bright flowers bursting from front gardens and a very beautifully patterned Oliver Bonas shop front. A heart carved into wet cement. Those coloured bollards. If anything, the real achievement of Artists Walk is to remind us to slow down, look around us (and up) and appreciate the beauty of buildings and the creativity of people that are constantly around us. No interactive map required."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48f56ea30f2649ef23535d34e5059549b786d80d/0_208_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3c5c6aae5b9842ab1ffcd84d8421ca1","title":"student pregnancies rise in kenyas lockdown in pictures","story":"Pandemic lockdowns are leading to rising rates of adolescent pregnancy in Kenya.

Her next project hopes to be just as empowering – but this time she’s listening to, not telling, the stories The writer formerly known as Eve Ensler has made some changes. First, there is her name. She is no longer Eve Ensler, not since writing her brilliant, blazing memoir, The Apology, which excavated the dead father who violently abused her throughout her childhood by jumping into his skin and speaking, chillingly, from inside his darkly skewed world.She is now V, joyously freed from the last vestige of that prescribed paternal identity. She has always loved the letter besides, she says, with its shape of “two arms outstretched in opening” and all the other words its holds within its embrace: “Vulnerable. Vital. Voluptuous. Vulva. Venus. Verisimilitude.”And vagina too, of course, the V-word incontrovertibly linked to the award-winning American playwright, activist and performer, as a result of her groundbreaking play, The Vagina Monologues. That drama touched so many hearts – and nerves – that it sparked V Day, a global activist movement to end violence against women and girls.It is not often that a single work of art lights a match to a worldwide movement of such scope. Since 1998, V Day has raised $120m for grassroots anti-violence groups and spawned initiatives including City of Joy and One Billion Rising. V did not anticipate the drama’s potential for transformation when she began performing it off-Broadway in 1996. “I was just hoping that somebody wouldn’t shoot me. That was my greatest fear,” she says, laughing. “What the piece taught me is that when you bust open something that people aren’t talking about, all they want to do is talk about it and share their experiences.”Although her drama has remained at the heart of V Day for the past 23 years, the writer has decided that, though it will still exist as a performed work in its own right, it will no longer be the centrepiece. So, why must the play that created the movement be decommissioned?What comes in its place is Voices, a campaign grounded in black women’s stories from across Africa and its diaspora. An interdisciplinary performance project in autumn 2021 will be created by women identifying as black around 20 chosen pieces will comprise the work, for which submissions are open, and each selected work awarded a stipend. It will be curated by the poet and activist, Aja Monet, who has dialled in from Los Angeles to join V on the Zoom call.Monet is keeping the remit wide, accepting everything from songs to visual art, poetry, work based around sound as well as oral storytelling. Narratives that are not traditionally western are welcome, and ones that do not present a “unilateral feminism” but “lean into” the difference. “This piece will ultimately be in service to and for black women all over the world, to speak to the complexities of our experiences as well as a collective vision for change, justice, compassion and solidarity,” she says.The Vagina Monologues has, in recent times, been called out by some for biological centricity, and Monet speaks of the shift in focus from women’s vaginas to their voices in this new campaign. “What we hope is for the ‘V’ in V Day to expand its definition and its relationship to women’s stories, realities, bodies and experiences.”“We know that the vagina informs many women in our communities. However, that is not the totality of the woman experience, so we really want to push ourselves to think about the ways our voices shape our representations of womanhood.”“The thing about racist patriarchy is that it’s persistent. It’s like a virus, always lodged somewhere,” says V. “When the conditions are right, it will rise up. But women’s movements around the world – whether black feminist movements or those fighting for healthcare, or the Earth, or immigrant rights – are the strongest they have ever been. Women are much more embodied and, as a result, patriarchs are pissed off and terrified.”“Change doesn’t happen without resistance,” adds Monet. “Of course, those who don’t want it are going to rise up against it.”V has long believed that art can incite and enact social change The Vagina Monologues is proof that it can be done. But I wonder if it serves the same purpose in these unprecedented times – during a global pandemic in which it is at risk of being seen as a luxury, not a necessity. “We are in a very weird place right now with our theatres closed for the most part around the world,” concedes V. “We’re in crisis, and crisis, as we know, is opportunity. It means we can open up and become something else as human beings. The role of art is to help that, to encourage that, to make people uneasy and to destabilise them so they begin to look at their lives in different ways. I have seen the power of women storytelling in a theatrical shape. It blows people’s hearts and minds open. I have enormous faith in art. If anything, it’s what I have most faith in because it gets beyond dualities and lives in ambiguities.”Monet also thinks this is a potent moment in which some boundaries have blurred and left us feeling more global. The internet, she says, has changed the way we receive art and “people now have an aerial view of the world in a way they didn’t before”.The way to meet the future, they both believe, is through listening, something that stripped-down pandemic life might have better tutored us in doing. “How do we really lean into active listening and what does it look like to cultivate a society that deepens its relationship to listening?”So might this pause serve us well in some way? “I think so. That’s why I’m very excited about Voices. The role in this for anybody who’s not a black woman is to listen, take this in, to allow this material to impact you, to transform you, to take you somewhere else where you haven’t been before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37acf8fdf362503dc59c28a64ead0e7360110756/76_502_3529_2117/master/3529.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=bd58afa9b4ff275329f9d3ebeeeca284","title":"sustainability is part of our fabric how a black entrepreneur overcame adversities to build a successful business","story":"William Adoasi launched the designer watch company Vitae London in 2016, beating the odds while championing a social justice-led approachWhat do you think when you see a luxury wristwatch? They’ve long been masculine symbols of affluence at the most lucrative end of the market they are appreciating assets that communicate to the world how much money you can afford to invest in a small, precious item.But when entrepreneur William Adoasi launched Vitae London in January 2016, he sought to invert the relationship between watches and ostentatious displays of wealth by championing a social justice-led approach, from ethical manufacturing to community investment. “We’ve tried to disrupt the watch industry and create a statement piece that shows the world how much you can give back.”For every watch a customer purchases from Vitae London, two sets of school uniforms are donated to a child in sub-Saharan Africa – without this uniform, the child would be turned away from school. Through social strategies such as this, Adoasi makes clear that his enterprise’s purpose is driven by a duty towards black communities, both the diasporas and those on the African continent.This is the first of the three principles that define Vitae London – purpose, product and people. Purpose underpins everything, then comes product: “Our products stand out because of the innovative designs that we regularly bring out. One of our watch ranges is designed to be fully interchangeable. So you can remove the bezel and strap, and one day your watch could be gold, the next day it could be rose gold, the next day it could be silver.” The third principle is people: “We’re trying to bring the community in on the journey – we allow the community to be able to buy shares in our company. We’ve had more than 600 people actually own and partake in the brand.”Adoasi’s focus on community and the African diaspora is something he is unapologetic about. “Being a diasporan myself of Ghanaian heritage, I feel that having a brand that links the homeland to the west and to diasporans is one of our strongest niches, and I don’t really shy away from that. I’m proud that we are a brand started by the diaspora, and that the diaspora will resonate very well with it.” But Adoasi’s African focus doesn’t impact on Vitae London’s appeal to other global communities. “We’ve seen purchases from all walks of life, we’re a brand that reaches all types of people,” he says.But as a black-owned business with an African-focused ethos, there have been significant barriers for Adoasi in securing investment and ensuring that investors understand his niche and take his market seriously. “It’s been an interesting journey. We launched in January 2016, and we only just got investment last year – through a US-based venture capital firm called Backstage Capital, which invests specifically in women and minority-led businesses. We did find issues contacting venture capitalists. It was hard for them to understand our market, our niche, our heart, the drive behind why we do what we do. So we found other methods to still be able to acquire this investment, but it did make it a more difficult process than it needed to be.”Product distribution, too, is often an issue experienced by black entrepreneurs, which is why PayPal’s mission to expand economic opportunities for black businesses and communities is having such an impact. For Adoasi, it has been transformative. “We’ve sold in more than 35 countries now. For us, PayPal has given us an additional layer of credibility,” he says. “We’ve been trying to sell into America, and the consumer protections that PayPal offers has helped our business’s reputation.”Why is PayPal unique? “It’s a platform that removes barriers to purchase and that’s the most important thing for an e-commerce business. I love that they have a heart for more than just financial gain,” says Adoasi. “I think in 2020 and beyond there’s going to be an upward curve with businesses thinking responsibly and beyond just the bottom line. Because you won’t be sustainable unless you have a heart for more than making money, so I really commend what PayPal is doing. It’s been a great tool for us, enabling us to scale as a business.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3083d558dc0959168659edeb815924d0f4003337/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d94b77da0779733252ec5ae260cab0b","title":"why would i ever go back to shopping new how vintage has become the future of buying ethically","story":"As we become more aware of the environmental impact of fast fashion, both sellers and buyers are looking for a more sustainable way to shopThrifting is becoming an essential tool in a world that increasingly rejects fast fashion, and Ladi Kazeem is among those making a sustainable life work for him – a situation that came about completely by chance.Kazeem is a celebrated seller on the online marketplace Depop, and has amassed a following of 181,000 people for his ability to procure high-demand vintage T-shirts from around the globe. There was never a dull moment in his world as he switched an unassuming hobby into a life-sustaining business.He spends his days hunting for rare T-shirts around the world and chatting with people online about vintage clothes. “Some vintage places have items upon items curated over the years just sitting there,” he says. “Why would I ever go back and shop new when I know there are warehouses full of stuff?”Kazeem was thrifting before he even knew what it was. For him, it wasn’t about buying gems but simply having a cheaper option at the age of 17, when he became “effectively homeless” after his mother died. “When I was younger, I was into Fred Perry, but the T-shirts were so expensive, so I’d go to vintage shops and find much cheaper versions with no visible differences,” he says. Growing up in Middlesbrough, there were a few vintage shops around his college so he would go early, buy the things he liked and give away the stuff he realised he wouldn’t wear.Given the demand for his castoffs, he soon realised there was potential to earn a living from his hobby, and after moving to London, thrifting was how he survived. “I had an idea what was valuable, so I’d buy a T-shirt, take it to this buy-and-sell shop in Notting Hill and give it to them to trade.”Soon, things became less about survival and more about curation and growth. “I found a bunch of T-shirts in the middle of nowhere and decided I would structure things. So one week I’d do hip-hop T-shirts and the next week I’d sell rock T-shirts and then film ones, and then before you knew it, it had turned into a business.”His business is relatively straightforward: buy cheap vintage items, sell them at a higher price. Still, there is an art to knowing history, culture and fashion and being able to spot valuable items. “With T-shirts, you need to know about the fabrics, the process of production, the year certain bands came out, and what T-shirts correspond with what dates. I know T-shirts inside out, so I know exactly what I’m looking for.”Most of Kazeem’s sales happen through Depop, where customers can choose to pay with PayPal. He says that the service has revolutionised the world of buying and selling preloved goods by providing an added layer of protection for sellers. “When I didn’t know PayPal existed, I was trying to get people to send money directly to my bank account – PayPal has brought protection to both buyers and sellers.”Kazeem buys and sells T-shirts all over the world, and PayPal makes selling goods internationally accessible. “Everybody is on PayPal these days, which makes things so much easier. Through PayPal, it is more straightforward to sell to different currencies.”Since lockdown, Kazeem has shifted from the world of T-shirts to posters, and has launched his online vintage poster store Surrealism Habituary. “I needed to start ersifying because the T-shirt market was so oversaturated,” he says. “I put some posters up for sale, and they all sold out on the same day.

He swam with great resolve (1) from where he slept each night with his partner, Josephine, against the current, to the edge of the gorgonian seafan (a type of coral) that the two inhabited.He never faltered. At the edge of the coral, the current was at its strongest, offering the greatest chance of sweeping his offspring out to the relative safety of the open ocean.Having grabbed on to the edge of the gorgonian with his tail, Tom began to give birth. Over several occasions I witnessed him release between six and 12 fry. The labour was obviously arduous and he was crunched over, panting for breath. Two of the dark-coloured fry are seen here (2) forcefully being expelled from his brood pouch. With adults measuring less than 2cm in length, the fry are just 2-3mm long. Their dark colour gives them some degree of camouflage in the open ocean and they will spend two to three weeks floating freely in currents, before settling to a gorgonian of their own.It took Tom a little while of crunching, drawing in water and crunching again before the last baby finally popped out (3). The juvenile had been with its siblings for almost two weeks in the brood pouch. When they are born, aside from colour, they appear to be miniature versions of their parents. It’s not until they settle to a new gorgonian that they adapt in surface texture and colour to match their particular home. I recorded the transition of a juvenile pygmy seahorse and it took five days to become a perfect match with the gorgonian.After all the babies have finally been released, the male pygmy seahorse is perhaps the only male in the animal kingdom to truly suffer from stretch marks. His empty brood pouch was now wrinkled (4) following the birth of the fry he had been carrying. Although he was clearly quite exhausted, Tom immediately headed back to where Josephine was resting. There wasn’t a moment’s respite for him, as Josephine quickly emerged and began a series of ritualised quivers to convey her intention to proceed to the next part of the reproductive cycle.After a series of ritualised dances, Tom and Josephine both released their grip of the gorgonian coral and their tails intertwined (5). Tom was still very deflated after having given birth 20 minutes or so before. Josephine, on the left, is clearly rather plump because she is full of a clutch of unfertilised eggs. Females begin to hydrate their clutch a few days before mating. The daily courtship rituals are carried out to help synchronise the pair’s reproductive cycles. It is important the female doesn’t begin to prepare the eggs for mating too early as they may spoil if the male is not ready.It took 45 seconds for Josephine to push the unfertilised eggs across to Tom’s empty brood pouch (6). As they entered his reproductive system he fertilised them. The sequence allowed Tom to be certain that each and every baby he would carry would be his own. This certainty of paternity is extremely rare in the animal kingdom, and explains why male seahorses put so much effort into raising their offspring. It was an honour to be the first person to witness and record this series of events.Bargibant’s and Denise’s pygmy seahorses live exclusively on the surface of gorgonian seafans (7). These seahorses are very hard to find because of their miniature size and fantastic camouflage, so knowing which species of gorgonians they live on is a huge help. Gorgonians are fan-like corals that can get as large as a car’s windscreen. They attach to the reef where ocean currents hit, bringing large volumes of nutrients. They are covered in polyps that trap plankton for food. These are animals, not plants, so don’t need sunlight for energy.In 2013 I was in Okinawa in Japan to attend a conference. Years before, I had seen a picture of an unusual pygmy seahorse taken in Japan that piqued my interest. After hours trawling the internet, I tracked down a location where I thought I might find it and headed to the small island of Hachijō-jima, south of Tokyo. Amazingly, over the course of a few days I managed to find more than a dozen of them (8) and was sure they were distinct from all others I had seen before.It wasn’t until I was presenting at another conference a few years later that things started moving forwards. During my keynote presentation, I mentioned these pygmy seahorses and that I was sure they were a new species. Graham Short, an expert in seahorse taxonomy, came and spoke to me, which immediately began a flurry of seahorse excitement. Eighteen months later, we named the new 2cm-long pygmy seahorse Hippocampus japapigu (9). At the time, it was thought to only occur in the waters off Japan, but it has since been confirmed as far south as Taiwan.In May of this year, colleagues from the International Union for Conservation of Nature and I named a new species of pygmy seahorse, Hippocampus nalu (10). A few months earlier, a e guide had spotted it in Sodwana Bay, in north-eastern South Africa. I went with a colleague to observe it first hand. It is the first pygmy seahorse to have been recorded anywhere in the Indian Ocean. The waters off South Africa are quite wild, and it wasn’t easy to find and photograph them as each surge wave dragged me several metres away from the subject.Several years ago a er came across a strange fish and assumed it was New Zealand’s first indigenous seahorse. It was, in fact, a new species of pygmy pipehorse (11), a very close relative of the seahorse. I managed to capture one of the only images of this species in the wild in 2017. At that time, it hadn’t been seen in over six months. The pipehorse is only 5-6cm long with immaculate camouflage. I found a pair clinging to a tiny algal frond.An undescribed species of ghost pipefish, commonly known as the velvetghost pipefish (12), tends to live around brightly coloured sponges, and each inidual pipefish matches exactly the colour of the sponge immediately adjacent to where it lives. There are half a dozen or so other ghost pipefishes found across the Indo-Pacific oceans, and each is highly adapted for its habitat. Some are white, others pink or even scarlet. They usually live in male-female pairs that hunt tiny shrimps and other crustaceans.Since the turn of the millennium there has been a flurry of discoveries of miniature fishes. I believe this is because the megafauna – such as sharks, turtles and rays – around south-east Asia have dwindled to such an extent that recreational ers and their guides began to look at smaller creatures to satisfy their curiosity. This thread pipehorse, Kyonemichthys rumengani (13), was described in 2007. It is just 2.6cm long and looks like several intertwined hairs moving around. Just like seahorses, these fish brood their young in a pouch on the male’s belly.Lynne’s pipefish, Festucalex rufus (14), was only named in 2015. Again, it evaded detection owing to its small size, habitat specificity and highly efficient camouflage. It is the size of a cocktail stick and lives only among little patches of a certain sponge found on coral reef walls below around 15 metres depth. It matches the sponge exactly in texture and colour, and even when you’re looking directly at one, it’s almost impossible to see it.Two risk factors for a species’ chance of extinction are their habitat specificity and geographic range. This pygmy seahorse (15) was named in 2009 as the Walea soft coral pygmy seahorse, Hippocampus waleananus. In the year before it was described, I observed it in the wild and am one of the few to have done so. It is only found in one small bay in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, where it lives only on the surface of certain soft corals. There has never been any research on their biology but the relative risks to their populations are great.Just one species of pygmy seahorse was known before the turn of the millennium. Since then, another seven have been added to the list. I took this image of Pontoh’s pygmy seahorse, Hippocampus pontohi (16), which was named in 2008, in February this year in Indonesia. The dark-coloured Pontoh’s were originally described as a distinct species, but genetic analysis has shown that they are the same as the white form. Seahorses are extremely variable in colour and surface texture, which has led to many new species being erroneously named over the years.The Japanese pygmy seahorse (17) appears superficially similar to several others, but genetic analysis shows it split from all others around 8 million years ago. It has a few morphological differences, too, which allow the trained eye to identify it. Unlike Bargibant’s and Denise’s pygmies, which live on the surface of gorgonian corals, I found the Japanese species grasping to the algal tufts that cover the huge volcanic boulders found around Hachijō-jima. Because of this, it is much harder to find them. The large swells off Hachijō mean it’s difficult to stay still enough in the water to keep an eye on them.Sadly, pristine coral reefs like this one in West Papua, Indonesia (18), are becoming much harder to find. One of the greatest threats comes from coral bleaching. When the water around coral reefs is 2C above the average for the time of year, the symbiotic algae within the coral’s cells become stressed and leave. The algae contain photosynthetic pigments that provide energy to the coral. In exchange, the coral provides the algae with its own waste products, which act as a fertiliser. Without the algae, coral is left ghostly white. Some researchers believe coral reefs in their current form may not survive beyond 2050. That, in turn, means the pygmy seahorse faces an uncertain future.The World Beneath: The Life and Times of Unknown Sea Creatures and Coral Reefs by Richard Smith is published by ApolloFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bac807d73a3d90895403d70061e6606788af971/0_1177_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f627d357998a5b8be2f9a3e033006996","title":"cruise ship 20 setting sail into the new normal photo essay","story":"In the midst of the pandemic, cruise ships are back with swab tests, socially distanced mini-golf – and the same old environmental damage. Can the bubble stay intact?by Chiara Di Giorgio. Photographs by Davide BertuccioItalians are warm people but we have put aside, for a while, the handshakes and hugs that are our dearest habits. We are on the MSC Grandiosa, the major first cruise ship to depart since lockdown began in Europe.It’s 16 August 2020, the day after an Italian ministerial decree that allowed cruises to restart, and the Grandiosa has already set sail from Genoa. “I have been on board since 25 January,” says one of the Grandisoa crew with an air of frustration and homesickness. “I have seen the ship stop and then leave again. I have never disembarked and, day by day, I have watched the world change.” “It was a sigh of relief for all of us,” she says. “After months of being stopped in the waters of the Mediterranean and the illusion of restarting business, this was slow in coming.”The stranded ship has become home for other crew who, like her, spend much of their lives at sea. Docked at Civitavecchia port near Rome, the boat was kept functioning throughout the Covid-19 pandemic by its stranded crew.Lockdown cut those emissions, and hit the cruise ship industry’s bottom line. Carnival Corporation, one of the world’s largest leisure travel companies, reported closing the second quarter of 2020 with a net loss of $4.3bn dollars (£3.25bn).Now, as the industry slowly restarts, there is a new prototype for cruise holidays.The new rules are designed to allow passengers to enjoy their holidays in peace, as if the virus belonged to another life. You can even hear the odd joyful shout, muffled by masks. Whether the virus can be contained on board is another matter. Last week in the Caribbean, five passengers tested positive on board a cruise ship. The restart of cruising has only been made possible by the creation of an onboard bubble – a floating island of dreams, hopes and spent savings young people on honeymoons alongside families and retired couples. The health emergency has reminded much of the world that the ability to go on holiday is not a given.“On board, it really feels like living in an idyllic place, where there is nothing to fear except that the swab test will hurt,” says one of the passengers. Our habits may have changed, but for now it appears that cruising – its pleasures and its environmental damage alike – will continue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/456cd6e6f731d7b64014fba25c02105e6046d298/122_419_3751_2251/master/3751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0752944153d3b1c8e229de31e2ae06c6","title":"suffocating closeness us judge condemns appalling conditions on industrial farms","story":"Pork giant Smithfield has settled with North Carolina residents who sued over stench, flies and truck traffic from Kinlaw FarmsA US judge has issued a blistering condemnation of industrial farming practices. The judgment comes as one US meat giant finally settles after a six-year legal battle with plaintiffs who sued the company over the stench, flies, buzzards and truck traffic coming from its industrial swine farms in North Carolina.J Harvie Wilkinson III, one of the judges in a case that pitted locals against the Smithfield subsidiary formerly known as Murphy-Brown, decried the “outrageous conditions” at Kinlaw Farms, the operation at the center of the lawsuit – “conditions that there is no reason to suppose were unique to that facility”.Wilkinson described a system in which pigs were forced to live in enclosures they had outgrown, reducing them “to almost suffocating closeness … The dangers endemic to such appalling conditions always manifested first in animal suffering. Ineluctably, however, the ripples of dysfunction would reach farm workers and, at last, members of the surrounding community.”His comments concurred with the court’s main opinion.More than 500 North Carolinians, most of them black, filed more than two dozen lawsuits in 2014. Some lived near farms that had contracts with Smithfield. Others lived near farms owned by the company outright. They described being trapped inside their own homes, sickened by the smell of hog waste stored in open pits, and unable to hang laundry, cook outdoors, or entertain visitors.The announcement of the company’s decision to settle came immediately after the fourth circuit in Richmond, Virginia, rejected a call from the world’s largest pork producer for a retrial of one of the cases. Juries in 2018 and 2019 had awarded hog farm neighbors almost $550m. The US district court in Raleigh, North Carolina, knocked the awards down to about $98m because of a state law capping punitive damages.Smithfield’s chief administrative officer, Keira Lombardo, said in a statement: “In the midst of a global pandemic, where food shortages have been commonplace, it is now the time to keep our full attention on the important work of producing good food in a responsible and sustainable way – rather than returning to the court for what would be ongoing and distracting litigation.” Details of the settlement were not disclosed.Smithfield lost the first five cases that went to trial. It appealed the three largest verdicts, calling the litigation an “almost existential threat” to North Carolina farmers. It claimed the district court had made numerous errors, such as allowing the neighbors’ odor expert to testify while excluding some testimony from Smithfield’s expert.In the new ruling, a three-judge panel rejected most of the pork producer’s arguments. The company “persisted in its chosen farming practices despite its knowledge of the harms to its neighbors, exhibiting wanton or wilful disregard of the neighbors’ rights to enjoyment of their property,” Judge Stephanie Thacker, an Obama nominee, wrote for the court.The appellate judges did agree with Smithfield on one point: that the plaintiff’s lawyer improperly used the parent company’s financial data to convince jurors that punitive damages had to be large enough for the pork giant to feel. The appellate ruling said jurors should not have heard those details. “We fail to see what value the parent company financial evidence would have that could possibly outweigh the substantial risk of prejudice it carries in that delicate context,” wrote Thacker.Elsie Herring, a plaintiff in another of the cases, said she was pleased that the court had sided with the neighbors on most issues. “Our lives have been destroyed by the industry,” she said. The North Carolina law firm Wallace \u0026amp Graham, which represented the plaintiffs, did not respond to questions about the settlement. It said in a statement that the appellate court “fully got the truth” of its clients’ struggles.Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

In consultation with Bendigo Regional Gallery,  Australia has produced the photoshoot that accompanies this story. It features several of the exhibited artists – alongside other Indigenous designers and artists.This year has also brought the launch of the National Indigenous Fashion awards more representation of Indigenous designers and artists in magazines and through collaborations with mainstream brands and the establishment of First Nations Fashion and Design, an Indigenous-led fashion peak body.But to call this coalescing of events a “moment” would be doing an injustice to those who have worked to make it happen.Here Grace Lilian Lee, designer and co-founder of First Nations Fashion and Design, and Shonae Hobson, the curator of Piinpi, discuss the present and future of Indigenous fashion design.Grace Lillian Lee: I’m so proud of you, Shonae, for curating the Piinpi exhibition. It’s so important for our people. I think the fact that this is the first one of its kind is a really special moment for people to take notice, not just in Australia, but globally.I think Indigenous fashion is the future of Australian fashion. It’s time for First Nations people to reclaim it.Shonae Hobson: There’s definitely a lot that non-Indigenous people and designers can learn from Indigenous people, especially in terms of sustainability.One of the really important things about Indigenous fashion – and I look at designers like Lyn-Al, and Julie Shaw with Maara collective, who’s done a beautiful collaboration with the women at Bula’Bula Arts – is sharing culture and passing on knowledge and storytelling through clothing in a really beautiful and elegant way.Lee: Being left out of the Australian fashion industry – not only the narrative, but the whole industry – has hampered the expression of what fashion looks like in Australia today.It’s also left out Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people economically. If things were different 50 years ago, I think a few First Nations designers would be household names.Hobson: Unlike western fashion, which focuses on the product, there’s more to it with First Nations design. It’s really about the process.This is the core essence of everything we’re wearing today GLLLee: I think a lot about what Leecee Carmichael (a NgugiQuandamooka artist and designer) speaks about, which is that weaving is the act of putting two fibres together and rubbing them on our legs. It has been happening for centuries, over 60,000 years. And this is the core essence of everything we’re wearing today.The act of weaving is so simple, but so difficult as well, because it’s arduous and it’s repetitive and it’s long. Maybe it’s a bit like life – but then you can create this beautiful thing.Hobson: Your practice is very much about traditional weaving techniques, and you do that through really beautiful and contemporary context. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you got to this point?Lee: In my final year of studying fashion at RMIT, I took my grandmother back to the Torres Strait – she hadn’t returned for 57 years. I was very young, I was 21, and I was like, “What is going on here?”My Nana asked: “What do you want to do about this?” And I realised I needed to make something to respond to it the best way I knew how to react to the situation was through my creative practice. I created a collection called Intertwined, and I connected with Uncle Ken Thaiday.Uncle Ken just kept inviting me back to learn more. I’d come in and bring my grandma, and they would have a yarn. Weaving with him was very organic. He wasn’t like, “I’m going to teach you this.” He was just doing it, and then I was like, “Ooh, can I have a try?”Fashion was a way for me to understand my cultural identity and to be proud of that, because that was suppressed in my father’s upbringing.Hobson: That concept of re-engaging with culture and community is so important.Lee: Fashion is very tangible and relatable and accessible. I like to call it a soft entry into reconciliation and healing our people – not only our mob, but also Australians who want to learn and feel more connected to our Country. It is an act of preservation of our cultural knowledge an act of being proud of who we are and where we come from – which is totally what I did, personally.I think we have a lot of knowledge to share collectively, but it’s important to ensure that we’re doing it ethically. Is the industry actually thriving? Are the people actually earning the money that’s needed? Is the support there?Hobson: I think that’s why what you’re doing with First Nations Fashion Design is so important. There has been a big gap in the market, and there hasn’t been that peak body representation for Indigenous people in Australia.Lee: The fashion industry on a broader scale has been pretty much based on trends. And it kind of does feel like – unfortunately, because of the power of the BLM movement – it’s become more “fashionable” for people to engage with Indigenous artists.The attention that we’re getting has been crazy, and we are trying to be very mindful of why people are pivoting, and why they are wanting to support this direction. If engaging is seen as just a trend, or just a “moment”, it’s not sustainable.Hobson: You’re so right. It’s going beyond tokenistic gestures and asking the question, “What more are we doing with communities to ensure sustainable livelihoods?”It is really about self determination. Not just, “I feel fulfilled now that I’ve worked with Indigenous people and now I’m going to go back and just keep doing what I was before”.I get tired of the fact that everyone expects Indigenous fashion to look like Indigenous art GLLLee: I think a lot of Australians are lost, and I think they’re probably lost because they don’t feel connected.The reason why First Nations work can be so powerful is because we are connected to our Country. So when we bring people that aren’t connected to this Country, and they come out on to Country, it’s a very special moment for them. But it can be a bit glorified and not really thought through.I get tired of the fact that everyone expects Indigenous fashion to look like Indigenous art. I think that’s really marginalising us into a category that’s restricted. I think that if artists are only being utilised – and utilised is the word – for their storyline and Aboriginality, it’s not really ethical.Hobson: There are so many things I don’t think a lot of people think about when they think of Indigenous fashion. Like when you go into a community, there is a style. The Indigenous jerseys, that people wear with pride, and the beautiful island dresses. It’s something that’s super important, and that I think Indigenous people have inherently made their own.The rise of social media has been a good avenue for people to get their brands out there and be entrepreneurs. We’ve got Teagan Cowlishaw’s Deadly Kween jumpsuit in the exhibition. She’s been a really important voice in this space, building her brand Aarli.For me to be able to wear something like that is just so empowering and uplifting. I think for young Indigenous people as well, it’s good to have that visibility within the colonial space. I think she’s been really great in that sense of reclaiming black identity through fashion, and empowering young black people to feel confident in themselves and their culture.You’re right, Grace, designers need to be met on the other end as well.Lee: We are already changing the face of what Australian fashion looks like. Now it’s about being more immersed within the industry, and more acknowledged within the industry. Without having these foundations that we’re building on right now, we’ll be back at where we were 50 years ago.The more people that are benefiting from the economic stimulation that the fashion industry creates within our nation, the better.I do know a lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who don’t want to be the artist and the storyteller. The ecosystem of the fashion industry is huge. It consists of textile designers, printmakers, cutters, sewers, pattern markers, drapers, trend forecasters, makeup artists, photographers, models, modelling agencies. How do we encourage the growth of all those different things?There’s a lot that could be further explored or just expressed through fashion, and it doesn’t have to be so literal in a sense. I think that we’re just at the beginning of what that looks like. I think we’re just scraping the edges.About the creative teamRhys Ripper is a creative director, stylist and model scout.

From Idris Elba as Heimdall in Marvel’s Thor films to John Boyega starring as stormtrooper Finn in the Star Wars sequel trilogy and even Halle Bailey as the Little Mermaid, there’s something about seeing black people in roles that might once have been played by white actors that really gets under the skin of organisations such as the Council of Conservative Citizens. The fact that nobody has any idea what levels of melanin Norse gods and mermaids had, or what the imperial troops looked like with their helmets off in the original Star Wars trilogy seems to have been conveniently forgotten.Lately, the culture war seems to have moved into more insidious territory. Rather than just spitting bile on horrible forums that the rest of us can happily ignore, fascist types have taken to “review-bombing” movies that don’t fit with their worldview, a process whereby trolls target a film’s user-generated IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes rating in an effort to stop people seeing it.The latest movie to suffer is the fantasy drama Come Away, which stars the British actor David Oyelowo and Angelina Jolie as parents of a young boy and girl, Alice and Peter, who use their imaginations to overcome family strife. The “problem” here for those of a certain disposition, of course, is that the film (out in the US at the weekend and available in the UK from 4 December), is intended as a prequel of sorts to Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan, meaning that both children are presented as being of mixed race.“I would be lying if I said I was surprised by it,” said Oyelowo of the review-bombing during an interview on Tamron Hall. “I’ve had other films that have had this done to them. Famously, we saw John Boyega having to deal with this because people didn’t like the idea of a black stormtrooper or Halle Bailey as the Little Mermaid.“For me personally, to see Keira Chansa as Alice from Alice in Wonderland or Jordan Nash as Peter, that’s what I didn’t get to see when I was 12 years old and I know that it would have slightly changed and reshaped my world view about where I fit in the world,” he said. “And at the end of the day, these are fictional characters in a fantasy fairytale, so it’s not any kind of displacement in terms of history. It’s just seeing these kids in the middle of this fantasy, which I think most kids would like to see.”Perhaps rather than asking themselves how these famous literary characters could possibly be played by people of colour, those opposing the film might consider looking at things from the opposite direction? Director Brenda Chapman reveals in an interview with IndieWire that she almost passed over Oyelowo’s profile when considering who should play the role of Jack, Peter and Alice’s dad, before realising he was the perfect choice.“I was disappointed – oh, it’s too bad, I’d love to work with him – and I moved on and then I sort of went back to his name like, wait a minute, why not?,” said Chapman. “And then, going through the story in my mind, it was like, I don’t need to change anything. It would open up the story so much more.”Seen from this perspective, the proper question might be whether it would be fair to deny Oyelowo the chance to appear in the role simply because the original tales of Alice and Wonderland and Peter Pan were written at a time when the demographics of Victorian and Georgian Britain were different from those of today.

He had missed the previous day’s match in Belgium and was back in his club’s care by the time England faced Iceland on Wednesday. Mourinho said he detected a discrepancy in the way different clubs are treated and also requested that Southgate confirm who he was referring to when he said in the week that managers were applying “huge pressure” to reduce players’ national team duties.Dier missed England’s defeat by Denmark in October after picking up a hamstring injury. He missed Spurs’ games against West Ham and Lask Linz before returning against Burnley.Mourinho backed Southgate’s decision to start Harry Kane against Belgium and Iceland in the most recent break but, in the same breath, suggested double standards were being employed regarding players’ use. “The only problem for me is that it should be the same for everybody, not just for some,” he said. Southgate had referred to the “power game” between England and club managers, noting that everybody is “looking to try and gain an advantage” in the context of an intensely competitive Premier League. Mourinho professed an interest in exactly who is engaging in such politicking.“I would like him to say who. I would like him to say which are the coaches who put pressure on the players not to go, and I would like him to say which are the coaches he calls and speaks on the phone with.

(Congratulations to Shane Duffy for doing that, and god knows he needs something to hold on to right now.) But if that wasn’t bad enough, Kenny has now been forced to lie low, his pre-match cultural melange having been leaked to an English newspaper not previously noted for its nuanced and balanced take on Anglo-Irish relations.

(It’s not announced details, though if it can’t find anyone in-house to head it up, we hear Sir Alex Allan is currently on the look-out for work.)

Three days before that the Azerbaijan men’s national football team drew 0-0 with Montenegro. Three days before that the Azerbaijan men’s national football team drew 0-0 with Slovenia. Four weeks before that the Azerbaijan men’s national football team drew 0-0 with Cyprus.0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0. In the course of this run Azerbaijan have pared their game down from six shots on target to just the one last time out. The natural end point of this graph, the real moment of fulfilment, would see Azerbaijan complete their next 0-0 with zero shots on target. Progress has been good so far. But only zero from zero will really do from here.This isn’t just about the hard numbers. Chuck in a succession of empty, mist-wreathed central European venues, plus an overall run of two goals in their past 10 games, and there is a case this is already the most overtly nihilistic run in international football history – a kind of real-time performance art piece, the Azerbaijan FA’s response to Andy Warhol’s five-hour film of the actor John Giorno lying in bed asleep.Although to be fair Giorno does turn over on to his back at one point, whereas Azerbaijan have stuck to a fairly rigid 4-4-2 throughout.At which point, and with some sadness, it is necessary to acknowledge the intrusion of real life into all this frivolity. That goalless run is not the most notable thing about Azerbaijan football right now. Of far greater significance is the fact all those games have been played away from home, two months on from Uefa’s ruling that football is no longer safe in Azerbaijan due to the war with Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.This has been a bloody affair. Russia estimates there have been more than 4,000 deaths. Azerbaijan’s second city, Ganja, has been hit by Scud missiles. Baku has declared a state of martial law. A fragile-looking truce is in place. But UK Foreign Office advice is not to go to Azerbaijan at all if you can avoid it.Except, it seems, if you’re Welsh. Absurd as it may sound, under the current Uefa schedule the Wales squad will be turning up in Baku six months from now for their Euro 2020 tournament camp, a prelude to two group games at the Olympic Stadium.This is still the plan. Get your passports out Wales fans. Scout the local bars. Ignore the local curfew, and the UK government’s suggestion that terrorists are “likely to try to carry out attacks in Azerbaijan”. Get ready for a feast of football. In the words of the Euro 2020 slogan, let’s “Live It For Real”. Although perhaps – as the military drone fleets descend – not quite this real.The most obvious point here is that any plans to play football in Azerbaijan next summer should be scrapped immediately. Uefa will surely end up announcing as much very shortly. But the UK government should take the lead here and insist on an immediate rescheduling. Uefa may be dancing about trying to placate its host partners. But there is no sensible reason to follow it down that road.This is not to suggest the problems of football fans are in any way central to what is a painful, longstanding mess. The Nagorno-Karabakh region is, Armenians contend, historically Armenian. It became part of Azerbaijan when Stalin reordered the region in the 1920s. At the collapse of the USSR Armenia attempted to claim it. Nagorno-Karabakh become a disputed, in-between place. Azerbaijan launched a full mobilisation to claim its legal territory in September this year.Cue displacement, death, and an alarmed global diaspora. Kim Kardashian’s Armenia-facing posts to her 250m social media followers are seen as a significant geopolitical lever. In response Azerbaijan has wheeled out a message of support from (seriously) Ronaldinho.And right now the world of anodyne, anthem-parping Uefa competition really does seem some way off. All of which raises a more specific question. Why exactly is European football heading to oil-rich Baku in the first place?There is a case to be made this all comes from the same place. Regional “strongmen” – in this case Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev, elected in succession to his father Heydar Aliyev – tend to enjoy posturing in all its forms, footballing and otherwise.It is certainly unfortunate that Azerbaijan’s public image has been tainted in this respect. It is only three years since the Azerbaijan Laundromat scandal broke, a circulation of billions of pounds of dirty money around Europe, apparently with the intention of promoting Azerbaijan’s global reputation. Various European politicians have been accused of accepting what were essentially large sums from the Azerbaijan government.There is no established connection to football. But the timeline is certainly unfortunate from a PR point of view. 2012-2014: Azerbaijan Laundromat scandal. September 2014: Baku selected as host for Euro 2020 by Uefa. No doubt Uefa’s president at the time, Michel Platini, was entirely unaware of the Laundromat. By the time the news of its existence broke Platini had left his post, and been banned from football for four years in 2015 over a payment to him from Fifa that was found to be “dishonest”. Platini did at least get the chance to open the Olympic Stadium in Baku, which is still lined up as a home from home for Wales a few months from now.What a shemozzle this tournament has become. There is a sad irony in the fact Euro 2020 was originally billed in 2012 as the product of a united Europe, a place where you can get on a plane to anywhere, and where anywhere is the same as everywhere. No boundaries, no borders: here was football’s celebration of the end of all that history.Eight years on, welcome to our world, a place where Azerbaijan have four straight nil-nils but not, as yet, anywhere to play their fifth because home has become impossible. It seems inconceivable Wales will end up making that trip. But it would be best for everyone if a decision is made sooner not later – and with a clear lead on exactly why."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daf04e2df75e447719af01c064209e3776cd8a21/0_202_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17cbe22fb3608ade1b03458319282ada","title":"uk sourced ppe from factories secretly using north korean slave labour","story":"Exclusive:  investigation finds evidence that Chinese PPE factories supplying UK government are breaking UN sanctionsThe British government has sourced PPE from factories in China where hundreds of North Korean women have been secretly working in conditions of modern slavery, according to evidence uncovered by the .’s findings indicate that hundreds of thousands of protective coveralls ordered for the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) have come from factories using North Korean labour in the Chinese city of Dandong.The three-month investigation has also found evidence of North Korean labour being used in factories exporting PPE to the US, Italy, Germany, South Africa, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Myanmar.It is claimed that the North Korean workers in Dandong, who are mostly women, work for up to 18 hours a day, with little or no time off. They are under constant surveillance and are unable to freely leave the factories.The UN has branded the export of workers to foreign countries by the North Korean regime as state-sponsored forced labour, defined as a form of modern slavery by the International Labour Organization.The findings suggest that the UK government may have indirectly funnelled taxpayers’ money into the pockets of Kim Jong-un and his brutal regime which the UN has said is guilty of “widespread and gross human rights violations” amounting to crimes against humanity.The government has faced mounting criticism over its lack of transparency and accountability in awarding billions of pounds of PPE deals using regulations that allow contracts to be awarded directly and without competitive bidding in cases of “extreme urgency”.“The government should not be using regulations that allow for emergency procurement to rush through contracts without even trying to find out if there are risks to workers in supply chains producing PPE. This lack of due diligence lays bare the truth that, far from effectively tackling modern slavery, the government’s policies are allowing the egregious exploitation of workers,” said Phil Bloomer, director of the Business \u0026amp Human Rights Resource Centre.Evidence indicates that the shipment of protective PPE overalls linked to North Korean labour was part of a contract awarded by the DHSC to Unispace Global Ltd, a commercial design company registered in the UK, which set up a PPE procurement operation called Unispace Health Ltd shortly after the pandemic began. It is now one of the UK’s largest contractors for PPE procurement.According to documentation seen by the , the order then went through a Chinese trading company before part of it was subcontracted to Dandong Huayang Textiles and Garments Co Ltd, a large garment factory in Dandong, which shares some of its orders with a branch factory. Both factories appear to be using workers from North Korea.There is no indication that the DHSC or Unispace Global Ltd knew that North Korean labour could be present in its PPE supply chains.Unispace Global Ltd did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the ’s findings.The shipment to the UK represents just a fraction of the PPE made by factories in Dandong which appears to use North Korean workers. In April 200,000 sterile coveralls landed in Bari, Italy, in boxes marked with Dandong Huayang’s distinctive branding. A distributor in South Africa advertised two million protective suits from the same company and smaller orders were found in the US, Germany, South Korea and Japan. found that two other factories in Dandong believed to be using North Korean workers have manufactured PPE for clients in the US and the Philippines.Situated on the banks of the Yalu River in north-east China, which forms the border with North Korea, Dandong’s garment manufacturers have been sourcing workers from the totalitarian state for years.It is a mutually beneficial arrangement, with Chinese factories getting a cheap and compliant workforce and the North Korean regime receiving millions of dollars in return.As the pandemic swept across the globe at the beginning of the year, garment manufacturers in Dandong quickly began to convert their production lines from clothing to isolation gowns and protective coveralls. Fourteen companies in Dandong have registered medical protective equipment products with the US Food and Drug Administration in 2020.The pivot to PPE was coordinated and supported by the local and provincial government, according to documents and reports on government and company websites.“Dandong has become a global centre of production for gowns and coveralls because they already have cheap North Korean labour. Gown production is labour intensive, so in Dandong it can be produced at the lowest cost and the highest profit,” said Seung-jae Kim, a South Korean author of two books on North Korean overseas workers.More than 21m pieces of PPE were produced by factories in and around the city between January and July this year, according to a post on the Dandong government website, making it a lucrative year for the city’s factory owners. “We’re all going to make millions,” said one.Despite this, the wages the workers are allowed to keep are still more than they could hope to earn in North Korea, leading to heavy demand for overseas work from the impoverished population.Remco Breuker, professor of Korean Studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, says despite this, the arrangement is still a form of forced labour.“Workers are not free to decline the work, to quit, to use their free time, if they have any, how they want to, to freely socialise, and they do not get paid sufficiently, or in extreme cases, at all,” he said.In a statement the DHSC said, “We expect all suppliers to the NHS to follow the highest legal and ethical standards and proper due diligence is carried out for all government contracts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07d4427f38c108b19d804bbda184287c64bd446d/1_0_1999_1200/master/1999.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=51d2b6db7fd922ac492dc7e229cea595","title":"tell us how has the pandemic affected your plans to have a baby","story":"We would like to hear from women who feel the Covid pandemic has impacted their chances of becoming a motherAlthough many commentators anticipate a ‘coronavirus baby boom’ next year, for some women hoping to become mothers, 2020 has been difficult.Many single women hoped to meet partners to settle down and have children with this year, only to find that dating was nearly impossible.

It’s a very telling performance. Twenty-one years old and still an unknown student (“Support the artists,” pleads the accompanying text, “this is only the beginning of their journey”) she’s vastly outnumbered by male counterparts who don’t seem to be taking her terribly seriously. It could be that they’re laughing and high-fiving while she performs because they’re incredulous at her skills, but it doesn’t really look that way. Yet she seems impossibly confident and self-possessed, ending her performance with the salacious, tongue-out taunt of “ahhh” that has since become her trademark. It isn’t just the benefit of hindsight that makes her seem the artist most likely to.Listening to her debut album four years on, it’s tempting to say that not much has changed. It drops with the same confidence you see in the video of her freestyling on that Houston rooftop. But then, why wouldn’t it? She ends 2020 on the cover of Time magazine, one of its 100 most influential people of the year. It caps off 12 months during which she has enjoyed viral ubiquity on TikTok thanks to a dance challenge based on her single Savage, which sold 3m copies in the US alone been granted a temporary restraining order against her record label, which she claimed were preventing her from releasing the music she wanted to created a vast storm – involving everyone from Republican congressional candidates to Russell Brand – with her Cardi B collaboration WAP, none of which harmed the single’s record-breaking commercial success delivered a speech about racism in the middle of a performance on Saturday Night Live and managed not merely to ride out the misogynistic online fallout from an incident in which she was shot, allegedly by rapper Tory Lanez, but skilfully turn it into a conversation about the protection of Black women.Good News therefore has something of the victory lap about it, but its contents also highlight something basic that’s occasionally been drowned out by the hubbub of controversy and social media chatter: she’s phenomenal at what she does. The internet is filled with memes in which grumpy middle-aged hip-hop fans bemoan the state of the art in recent years, but Megan Thee Stallion is a traditionally gifted rapper: her flow crisp and punchy, her lyrics teeming with sharp and funny lines – “invest in this pussy, boy – support black business” “all them bitches scary cats, I call ’em Carole Baskin” – and shrivelling put-downs. Whatever the outcome of the forthcoming court case over the shooting incident, the opening track, Shots Fired, dispenses its own kind of justice, ripping her (unnamed) assailant to bits along with their online supporters: “They hate me, but watch my videos beatin’ their dicks.” She has a fantastic line in inviting male rappers to guest and then deftly undercutting them. “Tell her shake it, drop her friends off and take her pants off,” suggests Lil Durk on Movie. “Tell him spend it – you ain’t got no money, keep your hands off,” she counters. He responds by bragging about the cost of his jewellery. “I’m a boss,” she sniffs in response, “I could buy the same thing that my man bought.”While there are pop-facing moments here, not least the slightly too toothsome Don’t Rock Me to Sleep, it’s an album that blithely ignores a lot of prevalent trends in hip-hop: it is 11 tracks in before anyone breaks out the AutoTune, and even then it’s guest star Popcaan. Instead, its USP involves setting its author up in a lineage of classic rap artists. You lose count of the musical references to hip-hop’s past. Shots Fired is based on Notorious BIG’s Who Shot Ya?, while Girls in the Hood reworks Eazy-E’s Boyz-n-the-Hood. The production by Juicy J of Three 6 Mafia (favourites of Megan Thee Stallion’s late mother, who was also a rapper) on Freaky Girls is audibly rooted in early 90s G-funk, and the sound of Go Crazy contains a sweet nod to Naughty By Nature’s 1991 hit OPP.Other samples appear pointed in their intent. The gorgeous electric piano motif on Outside comes from Something in My Heart by Michel’le, the R\u0026ampB singer-songwriter who endured a physically abusive relationship with Dr Dre: among a variety of assaults, he once shot at her.More often they serve to demonstrate that Megan Thee Stallion’s talents are a moveable feast – she sounds as at home snarling over the minimal 80s gangsta rap of Girls in the Hood as she does with Beyoncé’s voice weaving around hers on Savage Remix. And, of course, they imply that these artists are her forebears: in its own way, that’s as ballsy as SoundCloud rappers’ penchant for dismissing hip-hop history – but, as we’ve established, confidence isn’t really an issue for Megan Thee Stallion. Time will tell whether her implication is right. For the moment, Good News is more than good enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f14ba86a4eab8c244ef207e4883a6f14efbf57f9/0_72_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56071502b5d92ea4741c2432177a4307","title":"samuel paty france free speech debate podcast","story":"The murder of a schoolteacher who had shown his class cartoons of the prophet Muhammad during a lesson on free speech has rekindled a debate in France over secularism and the state’s role in regulating free expressionThe murder of the schoolteacher Samuel Paty has rekindled a long-running debate in France about secularism, free expression and the role of the state.

This is good,” she said.“Within the frame of the level playing field, progress, for example, has been made on the question of state aid, but there are still quite some metres to the finish line so there’s still a lot of work to do.“Where the timelines are concerned, time pressure is high without any question at the moment.“There’s a lot to work on, because there is now substance where you can go through line by line, word for word.“The whole team is engaged and working tirelessly day and night to reach the natural deadline we have to be done by the end of the year.”It is understood that the UK’s insistence that it needs to be able to set its own environmental, labour and social standards without any prior approval remains difficult, as does the definition of the current standards from which both sides say they will not regress.The details of the treaty’s dispute resolution system is also proving hard to thrash out, with the UK wanting fisheries to be outside any sanctions regime.A UK official said: “Although there has been some progress in recent days, there is much work to be done and time is now very short. We now need to see more realism from the EU on what it means for the UK to be an independent state.”EU sources said they were increasingly optimistic that agreement could be found, although time was said to be a concern.One EU diplomat said: “There is tangible progress on a number of areas while gaps are only slowly shrinking on core issues like level playing field, governance and fisheries.“Growing concern that the negotiation process does not proceed quickly enough to ensure the ratification of a possible agreement until the end-of-the-year deadline.“Hope is nevertheless that negotiations can be finalised quickly if and once the necessary political decisions are taken in London.“At the same time, EU member states are in agreement that contingency planning needs to be ramped up in parallel to the ongoing and hopefully successful EU-UK negotiation process. Still the EU needs to be prepared for every possible outcome.”Such is the shortness of time, that Juhansone told the ambassadors it was likely they would not be able to translate the treaty of over 600 pages into all of the bloc’s 23 official languages.France’s ambassador insisted that the translation of the treaty into French was key for Paris to approve the deal, and called for a discussion on the legal nature of the agreement within days.If the treaty only involves EU competences, it will only need consent by the European parliament but the process is complicated when it affects areas where national parliaments have a decisive role.The deal, even if it involves both EU and national competences, could provisionally be brought into force on 1 January, with the national parliaments ratifying at a later date. But member states are seeking time at least for their MPs to debate the detail of the deal in the remaining month and a half.Officials dismissed suggestions that the European parliament could give its consent after 31 December. “It is not being considered,” said one source."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bad7e6c95dfe6b5532c5ea68eafeb6e9a2cdadf/0_68_4914_2948/master/4914.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=338e15da82a9240ad7e1ca286e59778f","title":"what does the turmoil in downing street mean for britain podcast","story":"Boris Johnson has gotten rid of his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and his director of communications, Lee Cain. Katy Balls explains what it means for Brexit and the government’s handling of the Covid crisis Less than a year ago, Boris Johnson was returned to Downing Street as a Conservative prime minister with the biggest majority since Margaret Thatcher. It was a victory that seemed to vindicate his decision to bring highly controversial figures from the successful Vote Leave campaign of 2016 into the heart of his operation. Now, after a year of chaos and crisis, two of the most high profile figures have departed amid a blaze of infighting and recriminations.  The political journalist Katy Balls tells Anushka Asthana how things changed quickly in recent weeks. While Boris Johnson had protected his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, from calls to resign in the summer, now he has decided to let him go, along with the director of communications, Lee Cain. It leaves a vacuum at the heart of Downing Street that some believe is now being filled by Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds, (a one-time Tory spin doctor herself) and his new press secretary Allegra Stratton. What will it mean for the looming Brexit deadline, the response to the Covid crisis and the solemn promises of a new kind of politics to voters in former “red wall” seats in the north of England and the Midlands?

No. There are serious hurdles to be overcome first, and they are important to ensure the potential vaccine is safe.There are regulatory bodies all over the world but the main ones for these vaccines are the Food and Drug Administration in the US, the European Medicines Agency, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority in the UK. The UK would normally wait for EMA approval, but the government has passed legislation to enable the MHRA to do it alone, as it will post-Brexit anyway, in the interests of speed.They will look at all the data from all the trials to ensure they have been conducted properly and that there is robust evidence the vaccine works and does not cause serious side effects. It’s a bit like marking the companies’ homework to make sure they have got it right. They will also look to see that the vaccine can be safely manufactured in accordance with a set of standards called Good Manufacturing Practice. That relates to the strict sterilisation and hygiene standards required.They say absolutely not, and emphasise that safety is the most important thing – more so than how well the vaccine works. Every part of the research and development and authorisation processes has been sped up, but mostly by overlapping them. So the regulators have been given all the trial data as it comes along. They have the data from the early lab work, as well as the animal research and the safety trials in humans and have been conducting what they call rolling reviews. So when the final large-scale trial results from tens of thousands of people come in, they can add those to what they have, and hopefully make a faster decision. Manufacturing has been taking place even while the vaccines are being trialled, which is a financial risk, because if the vaccines had failed, all the stocks would have had to be destroyed.Usually, from development to authorisation takes anything from months to several years. The actual time the MHRA or EMA spend poring over the data and asking questions is stipulated in the rules as up to 210 days. But the rolling reviews should cut the time substantially and the UK government has said it will ask for emergency authorisation under regulation 174, which speeds up the process but requires review within a year to ensure safety."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13146c266fb33bc5134921973a3bb4b17b94ddc5/0_70_5446_3268/master/5446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81696967874fc013cda19365753f849b","title":"england squad match to go ahead as south africa record second positive","story":"England will press ahead with a 40-over intra-squad warmup match at Newlands on Saturday despite a second South African player testing positive for Covid-19 ahead of next Friday’s Twenty20 series opener.An official update from Cricket South Africa on Friday confirmed there are now four unnamed Proteas players in isolation – two due to close contact with Wednesday’s initial case – and their own practice game has now been cancelled.The statement read: “One player has returned a positive result after the Proteas’ second, mandatory round of Covid-19 testing ahead of the limited-overs tour against England.“The player was isolated from the rest of the team and moved to separate, appropriate accommodation with immediate effect. The team’s medical and support staff will monitor the player to ensure his physical health and mental wellbeing.“To that end, the intra-squad practice match that was scheduled for Saturday, 21 November has been cancelled. CSA would like to reiterate that it will not release names of affected players because of doctor-patient confidentiality.”With South Africa having a 24-man squad, and the ability to bring additional players into the bubble at short notice, there is no suggestion yet that a tour deemed vital to the home board’s finances is in doubt. Two additional reserve players have already been sent home due to the cancellation of their warmup.The greatest threat to the viability of a short tour that features three T20s and three one-day internationals instead appears to hinge on whether the virus spreads through the 23-strong England camp, given their inability to draft in extra players.The two squads are staying in separate wings of the Vineyard Hotel in Newlands and England have thus far returned only negative test results since arriving on Tuesday. “Our plans continue and the team are preparing to play our first intra-squad warmup match as normal at Newlands,” a team spokesperson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a26a56cfa29d89e316d8032f43a0756b5213b23e/0_52_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a83369bf7cd895facd3f960dd8e8825","title":"novak djokovic straight sets win over zverev nets semi final atp spot tennis","story":"Novak Djokovic moves on, to his ninth semi-final in London. Alexander Zverev remains stuck in a personal dilemma, although he might be relieved to be out of ATP Tour Finals as questions about abuse allegations from his former girlfriend Olya Sharypova continue to haunt him.Their show-or-go shootout on day six was a tense and uneven affair, and Djokovic, a five-time champion, prevailed with his deep-rooted gift of riding out serial crises to win 6-3, 7-6 (4) in an hour and 36 minutes.The world No 1 was satisfied with his performance – and in between flurries of ordinary tennis, there were stretches of excellence from both of them. Djokovic, who lost to Zverev in the 2018 final, beat him for the fourth time in six encounters, although a second look at the tape before he plays the world No 3, Dominic Thiem, on Saturday would not be wasted.Almost inevitably, the emphasis later switched from tennis to the rumblings off court. Asked how other players had reacted to him, Zverev said: “They are all fine to me. The relationship between me and the players won’t change. The players know what’s going on. I have said everything that I can. It’s very unfortunate that these kind of false allegations can put such damage and put the attention away from the sport. But it’s the world we live in right now, unfortunately. There is nothing more that I can do.”Djokovic, who has been nominated to return to the ATP players council and is regarded as something of a moral guide in the sport, gave him qualified support. “I have not noticed he has been treated differently in the locker room, but I have not talked to him about that specific case,” he said. “I did tell him I am here if he needs to talk. He’s been handling it well, by the looks of his results. I sincerely wish for him that he overcomes this soon.”Djokovic made a near-perfect start, winning nine of the first 10 points as he raced to 3-0 before needing to wipe his brow. Zverev briefly struggled to control his serve until a love hold calmed his twitching right arm.The rallies lengthened and the level rose appreciably although it took Zverev 20 minutes to find a rhythm, a second ace lifting his spirits, as did two break points in the pivotal seventh game. Djokovic’s tennis slipped a little and he had to hold through deuce with a controlled smash for 5-2. Zverev kept the set alive with his third ace before Djokovic, who had lost his earlier certainty, served out nervously after 33 minutes.Zverev, having re-established his credentials behind an improved serve, hit a pair of aces and a double fault to hold at the start of the second set, which lasted twice as long as the first. Djokovic, who had skipped the Paris Masters to be fresh for this tournament, was briefly subdued, his groundstrokes tentative, his feet not so spritely. A third double fault handed Zverev break point in the fourth game, but he could not cash in after an extended deuce battle.Zverev was hitting hard and deep yet was unable to make the most of his opportunities. Consecutive double faults in the fifth game switched pressure to his end he saved two break points, one with another ace, and held shakily to stay ahead in the serving cycle just short of the hour.They toiled to the tie-break and Djokovic rediscovered his focus – although his relief when Zverev shoved his final shot into the net was evident in his ritual cup-of-love homage to the (empty) arena."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c708e76ffc2992e75be82e6e147817c662e6116/988_470_4996_2997/master/4996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11573baab54ccdc17d88099764ac3929","title":"solo pantos christmas 2020 cinderella buttons","story":"From Polly Lister playing a dozen characters in Scarborough’s Snow Queen to Tom Binns’s solitary Buttons, one is fun for 2020’s pantomimes‘The length of each act should be the length of a child’s bladder,” Polly Lister laughs. “You never want it to spill over.” Due to Covid restrictions, panto dames and the back-ends of horses have been stuck without a stage this Christmas, but some theatres have found a way to keep the panto magic alive. Working within the restrictions of social distancing, the rule of six and the avoidance of mixing households, theatres up and down the country are offering a sudden burst of one-person shows. Lister is one of the solo performers hoping to bring a bit of Christmas cheer to the end of this miserable year.“We’ve got a poet raven, a Scottish robber, a Brummie reindeer – not the famous one,” lists Lister, who will play almost a dozen characters in Scarborough’s The Snow Queen. Staged at the Stephen Joseph Theatre (SJT), the show was originally intended for a cast of five, but to avoid a gamble, they whittled it down to one actor. “We workshopped it over Zoom, got characters up on their feet and picked the best of the bunch.” The protagonists, Kai and Gerder, begin their life as baubles on a Christmas tree.Normally in Scarborough, Santa arrives by boat alongside a group of fishermen to turn on the Christmas lights. With those plans cancelled this year, Lister believes the theatre has a duty to serve some extra joy. “We’re going all out,” she says determinedly. “Christmas isn’t cancelled in Scarborough.”Alongside the regular measures of masks, hand sanitiser and social distancing, the SJT has created a whole separate bubble with performer Jacoba Williams. Throughout the run, Williams will be performing two shows a week, and if anyone from Lister’s team needs to isolate, she and her group will take over all of the performances. “If our bubble goes down,” Lister says, “the show will still go on.”Further south is Mama G – or Mother Goose, if you’re feeling formal – a panto-dame drag queen created by Robert Pearce. “Panto is unique in its ability to communicate with every single age group,” says Pearce, who’s been producing what he calls petite pantos since 2018. “We did a Dick Whittington that was all about Brexit and Windrush, and we did Mother Goose where Trump was the baddie. All of his lines were verbatim – which was really too easy to do.” The trick to managing the energy as a solo performer, he says, is feeding off the energy of the audience. “It’s like a tennis match, we’re constantly passing it to each other.”Mama G’s stories are sprinkled with tales of inclusivity and acceptance. “What I’m really saying to kids,” Pearce says, “is to understand that if you’re gay, know that someone, in a really fun way, told you that that was OK.” As well as performing as Mama G in a full-scale socially distanced panto in Gravesend, he’s producing a three-person musical, adapted for Christmas but tourable all year. Eunice! is a musical story of a horse unsure of who she is, and will be raising money for the LGBTQ+ charity Mermaids.Over in Oldham, the Coliseum theatre has a digital treat in store with solo shows of Cinderella and Dick Whittington. “The panto is a huge part of Christmas in Oldham,” says Shorelle Hepkin, who is playing Cinderella, “and with this being the first time in years, possibly decades, they can’t put one on, it keeps the magic alive while the theatre can’t be physically open.” The piece is told from Cinderella’s perspective, so we get her first-hand thoughts on the ugly sisters and her prince.When she was 11, Hepkin drove Cinderella to the ball as a member of the panto ensemble. In 2018, she finally got to wear the glass slippers as she took to the Oldham stage as Cinderella herself. She says performing panto is “such a magical experience”, especially because it’s often the first time children will have gone to the theatre. “To see them get so involved, dancing along, it makes your heart melt.” The only difference this year, she says, is that she’ll be performing “down a camera instead of to 500 screaming kids”.Another lone performer this Christmas is comedian Tom Binns, playing firm panto favourite Buttons, who learns from Zoom that the rest of his cast has been furloughed he didn’t get the memo. More of an Edinburgh fringe kind of man, this is Binns’ first panto. “I’m thankful for the lockdown,” he says. “I don’t think I would have got it finished otherwise.”Binns wanted to retain a lot of the core panto traditions, but aligning them with Covid rules has required some lateral thinking. “One of the classics is the singalong, where you have the mums and dads singing against the kids,” he says. As singing in groups isn’t allowed, he’ll be teaching the audience a song in Makaton instead.If things go wrong, Binns believes the crowd will be on his side. Over the summer he has been performing drive-in comedy gigs from the converted roof of his van. “We had some technical problems but people just didn’t care.” He has faith that panto audiences will take a similar view. “I’ve been to see a panto at least once a year since 1981, when I saw Bobby Lupton at the Crucible,” he says. “I’m yet to find a reluctant audience!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fcb98856fcbb88a58db8411f89395589e657202/0_203_5508_3306/master/5508.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6abff2992f745fd5c2874fdf181271fa","title":"it gave me hope in democracy how french citizens are embracing people power","story":"Towns, cities and regions around France are turning to assemblies of unelected citizens to guide them on everything from climate to coronavirusAngela Brito was driving back to her home in the Parisian suburb of Seine-et-Marne one day in September 2019 when the phone rang. The 47-year-old caregiver, accustomed to emergency calls, pulled over in her old Renault Megane to answer. The voice on the other end of the line informed her she had been randomly selected to take part in a French citizens’ convention on climate. Would she, the caller asked, be interested?“I thought it was a real prank,” says Brito, a single mother of four who was born in the south of Portugal. “I’d never heard anything about it before. But I said yes, without asking any details. I didn’t believe it.’”Brito received a letter confirming her participation but she still didn’t really take it seriously. On 4 October, the official launch day, she got up at 7am as usual and, while driving to meet her first patient of the day, heard a radio news item on how 150 ordinary citizens had been randomly chosen for this new climate convention. “I said to myself, ah, maybe it was true,” she recalls.At the home of her second patient, a good-humoured old man in a wheelchair, the TV news was on. Images of the grand Art Déco-style Palais d’Iéna, home of the citizens’ gathering, filled the screen. “I looked at him and said, ‘I’m supposed to be one of those 150,’” says Brito. “He told me, ‘What are you doing here then? Leave, get out, go there!’” Brito had two hours to get to the Palais d’Iéna. “I arrived a little late, but I arrived!” she says.The climate convention made headlines with recommendations such as making ecocide a crime enshrining climate goals into the French constitution banning domestic flights on journeys that can be done by train in under two and a half hours cutting VAT on train tickets and making a vegetarian option compulsory in public catering. But it also showed how, against a collapse of trust in traditional politics, directly involving citizens could improve community cohesion and reinvigorate democracy both locally and nationally. Macron pledged to put the key proposals drafted by Brito and her fellow citizens to a referendum by 2021.The French revolution may have introduced the modern concept of citizen democracy to Europe. But the Greeks invented the citizens’ assembly: as far back as 621BC the ecclesia, or popular assembly of ancient Athens was a forum in which any male citizen regardless of class could participate.Now, with a pandemic-induced economic and social crisis looming, this ancient democratic tool is being updated for the 21st century. Towns, cities and regions across France are increasingly turning to their citizens to help steer them towards a more egalitarian future.Last month around 100 citizens from the Occitane region – ning the cities of Toulouse, Montpellier and Carcassonne – completed a convention aimed at “improving the lives of inhabitants”. It was France’s first regional citizens’ convention.“We are a large region, so we must make sure we are not disconnected and that politics is adapted to the feelings and desires of the people,” says Carole Delga, president of Occitane and a Socialist party MP. Ahead of regional elections due next spring, other cities are following suit. Nantes is convening an assembly between this month and February 2021, in which 80 locals will assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, record their concerns and priorities and outline courses of action. Nancy plans to convene at least 200 residents in January, Poitiers aims for one in September 2021, and Marseille is considering the creation of a “parliament of the future”, bringing together residents, politicians and experts to forge policy.“Conventions intervene in the political process so that ordinary citizens can be heard and can counteract powerful interest groups,” says Loïc Blondiaux, a professor of political science at the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne and a member of the climate convention’s governance committee. “With the collapse of democracy as we know it, the political system will have to change in the coming years. What conventions do is they represent all citizens and they re-legitimise the process of decision-making.”Occitane’s citizens covered a broad range of topics including the environment, transport, the digital economy, healthy food, and the ruralurban ide, and despite being hamstrung and truncated by the pandemic has been heralded as a success.Detailed discussions were conducted in smaller breakout groups, with evidence provided by independent experts and votes on proposals such as encouraging companies to hire graduates, putting local railway lines back into circulation, helping farmers to market their products locally and revitalising ailing town centres.“We can’t become experts in a matter of weeks, but there were many things I learnt,” says Gérard Pithon, 70, a retired social psychology teacher from Montpellier who took part in the convention.“It was a very enriching experience,” adds Clarisse Pintat, 31-year-old Franco-Brasilian chef from Toulouse. “It’s the closest I’ve been in my life to political power. It gave me, to a certain extent, hope in the dynamics of democracy.”This sentiment was echoed by Brito of the climate convention, who says her initial disbelief was due to the fact “politics doesn’t usually give a voice to people like me”.The spread of citizens’ conventions in France can be seen partly as a response to the gilets jaunes crisis, which was triggered by a popular backlash against fuel taxes linked to climate policy and morphed into a more complex grassroots revolt against a range of social and economic pressures and inequalities.President Macron’s initial reaction to the gilets jaunes protests was to launch a series of nationwide grands débats about public policy. This failed, says Bedock, because participation was self-selecting and it came to represent “the opposite of the gilets jaunes”. Participants were older, richer and seen as more privileged. “By ensuring citizens’ conventions are based on random selection and that they reflect society, this issue was solved,” she says.For many,the inspirational modern example is Ireland’s 2016-2018 citizens’ assembly, which broke years of political deadlock, leading to a referendum and repeal of the country’s longstanding constitutional ban on abortion.“It was a very tricky issue,” says Jane Suiter, who worked as a senior research fellow on the Irish citizens’ assembly. “But I think it worked because the public sees that it’s everyday people – the unemployed, bus drivers, all kinds of society – who decide. They aren’t the usual suspects, the talking heads on television. That tends to increase trust.”Belgium’s German-speaking region last year set up a permanent 24-person citizen’s council, chosen by lottery, to work alongside the region’s parliament. Its members in turn organise citizens’ assemblies of up to 50 people, which meet for three weekends over three months on specific policy issues chosen by the citizens’ council.In an era of extreme polarisation on everything from Brexit, immigration and secularism to the Covid-19 response – some believe citizens’ conventions are a priceless tool.“They can help resolve issues that usually polarise people,” says George Zarkadakis, author of Cyber Republic, a new book exploring how to make democracies more inclusive in the digital age. “What’s happened with Covid-19 is that it’s been polarised and politicised. There are people opposed to and in favour of lockdown, but if you look at the arguments they aren’t really scientific. Citizens’ conventions offer de-polarisation by removing ulterior motives.”Zarkadakis argues that in future citizens’ conventions will also hugely benefit from the deployment of technologies such as crypto-currencies, artificial intelligence and blockchain – which would in turn give them greater autonomy, better learning tools and smart contracts that will make it easier for political pledges to be held to account. “Technology can help that transformation,” he says.Yet, questions remain, from relatively technicalities to more fundamental issues about legitimacy and whether citizens’ conventions can have genuine political bite.Claudia Chwalisz, main author of an OECD report published in June, which studied nearly 300 examples of citizens’ assemblies says that participants and organisers often complain about a basic lack of time and funding – the French climate convention was, for example, held over 10 three-day sessions, but Occitane’s lasted just 10 days.“It’s a work in progress,” says Chwalisz. “They cannot completely replace the traditional representative system. But we must look to the future: how do we institutionalise these forms of public deliberation so that citizens can play a role?”Others are concerned that without guarantees and funding put in place by authorities, the role of citizens’ conventions could be superficial. A UK citizens’ assembly on climate which met in the spring of 2020 put forward a range of recommendations but, unlike in France, there is no obligation on the UK parliament or government to even consider them.“You need a legal contract between the politicians and the citizens, otherwise I fear that they will remain marginal and their effect will be only cosmetic,” says Prof Blondiaux. “And there’s a risk of politically marginalising these conventions if there’s not enough support to ensure the wider public understands and agrees with the process.”For all the caveats, many of France’s participants now eulogise the assemblies as a step into a brave new world of togetherness.“I learnt a lot of things,” says Eloise, a 17-year-old from Dunkirk who was one of the six minors who took part in the climate convention. “I learnt about the environment. I learnt how to listen to other people. I learnt how to debate. But the most important thing I learnt was the force of collective intelligence. We must invest in it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c797e24bd67e78416b29f669879017a2688d4e41/0_436_5568_3340/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78e7d300002f90cd0711f88a540902d3","title":"nagorno karabakh azerbaijani troops enter first district handed over by armenia","story":"Military moves into first of districts handed over under Russia-brokered peace dealAzerbaijan forces have entered a district bordering Nagorno-Karabakh as the country begins retaking territory held for nearly 30 years by the Armenian-backed government as part of a Russian-brokered peace deal.Video showed troops and armoured vehicles moving into the district of Aghdam, which Armenia conceded in a controversial armistice, one day after columns of its soldiers and tanks rolled out of the territory.Armenia will also hand over the Kalbajar district wedged between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia on 25 November and the Lachin district by 1 December.On Thursday, Armenian residents of Aghdam hurriedly picked pomegranates and persimmons from trees surrounding their homes and packed vans with furniture, before fleeing in the run-up to the official deadline to cede the mountainous province.“We wanted to build a sauna, kitchen. But now I had to dismantle everything. And I’ll burn down the house with everything I own when I leave,” Gagik Grigoryan, a 40-year-old electrical worker, told Reuters before abandoning his home.Tens of thousands of Azerbaijanis are expected to return to the region. On Friday, Azerbaijan quickly organised prayers at a local mosque to signal the return of the city to the control of the mostly Muslim country.Political tensions have remained high in Armenia, where the truce was viewed by many as a capitulation by the government of prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan.On Friday, several Armenian news sources reported that the minister of defence, David Tonoyan, had tendered his resignation in what, if confirmed, would be another exit of a high-ranking official from his cabinet. The country’s foreign minister resigned earlier this week and its president, Armen Sarkisian, had called for Pashinyan to step down and allow snap elections to lead the country out of the crisis.Pashinyan has responded with calls for unity and has issued a government roadmap out of the crisis that include returning refugees to the Karabakh region, which Armenia calls Artsakh, and modernising the country’s military. He has called for greater development in Stepanakert and those territories remaining under Armenian control.Fierce clashes between Azerbaijan’s forces and Armenian separatists broke out in late September in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The war lasted six weeks, leaving thousands dead and displacing many more.The longstanding ex-Soviet rivals finally agreed to end hostilities last week under the framework of a Russian-brokered accord under which Moscow will deploy peacekeepers to the region and Armenia must cede swathes of territory.Separatists in Nagorno-Karabakh and several surrounding districts captured the territory and claimed independence that has not been recognised internationally, even by Armenia, after a post-Soviet 1990s war that left 30,000 dead.The exchange of territory was originally expected to begin on Sunday, with Armenians in the Kalbajar district fleeing en masse before the official deadline for Azerbaijan’s takeover.But Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, postponed the deadline by one week over “humanitarian” considerations.The Russian peacekeeping force of 2,000 troops has deployed to the administrative centre of the region, Stepanakert, and set up checkpoints and observation posts along the strategic Lachin corridor connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia.While Armenians in the provinces to be handed over to Azerbaijan have left in an exodus, the Russian mission on Thursday said it had bussed 3,000 residents back to Stepanakert and other regions who had fled during the six weeks of heavy shelling.Most of Azerbaijan’s south-western district of Aghdam has been under the control of Armenian separatists since 1993. Before the post-Soviet war it was inhabited by 130,000 people – mostly ethnic Azerbaijanis who were expelled from their homes.Armenia’s health ministry said this week that more than 2,400 of the country’s fighters had been killed in the clashes. Azerbaijan has not revealed its military fatalities.After the peace accord was signed last week, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said total fatalities that included dozens of civilians had surpassed 4,000 people.Russia’s decisive role in the settlement has sidelined the United States and France, which brokered a ceasefire in the 1990s but failed to deliver a long-term resolution.During the most recent conflict, France, the US and Russia attempted to broker three separate ceasefires that collapsed as Armenia and Azerbaijan accused the other of violations.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, this week urged Russia to clarify “ambiguities” over the ceasefire, including Turkey’s role in the peacekeeping mission.Azerbaijan has insisted on a prominent role for its staunch ally Turkey, which was widely accused by western countries, Russia and Armenia of supplying Baku with mercenary fighters from Syria over the weeks of fighting.The Kremlin has poured cold water on Ankara’s hopes of deploying peacekeepers alongside Russian troops in Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding provinces and instead insisted that Turkey observe the truce from monitoring posts in Azerbaijan.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbc3e9957a1f55d5d50de08adb13555d8b16fafb/17_1303_1379_828/master/1379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b3d34055c8c8661b09eb31194a9743f","title":"remains in german case show signs of cannibalism","story":"Berlin prosecutors say suspect in death of 44-year-old man had interest in the subjectGerman prosecutors say there is evidence of cannibalism in the killing of a 44-year-old man whose remains were found in Berlin this month.A 41-year-old man was arrested at his home on Thursday on suspicion of murder with sexual motives, close to the site where the victim’s bones were found.“The suspect had an interest in cannibalism,” Berlin prosecutors’ office spokesman Martin Steltner said. “He searched online for the topic.”Steltner said it was unclear whether the victim had also had an interest in cannibalism. The two men, both Germans, had been in touch with each other online via a chat forum called Planet Romeo, according to a report in Der Spiegel.On 8 November a walker had chanced upon the skeletal remains of a human leg on a field on the northern outskirts of Berlin, near the border with Brandenburg state.On the bones investigators discovered bite marks, though they said it was still unclear if they were human or from an animal.The remains were those of a 44-year-old high-voltage technician who had gone missing from his shared apartment in Berlin’s Lichtenberg district on 5 September.A search involving specially trained sniffer dogs eventually led police to the apartment of the 41-year-old suspect, a maths and chemistry teacher at a secondary school, where they discovered knives, a bone cutter saw used by surgeons, and an oversized cooling box.The Bild newspaper reported that investigators had also discovered 25kg of sodium hydroxide, a reagent that can be used to dissolve bodily tissue. The suspect reportedly claimed he had wanted to make soap.The full names of the victim and the suspect haven’t been released for privacy reasons.Reports of the arrest have evoked parallels to the infamous case of the “Rotenburg cannibal”. In 2006, a German court convicted Armin Meiwes of murder and disturbing the peace for killing a man he had met online and eating him. Meiwes is serving a life sentence.Unlike the suspect arrested over the Berlin murder, Meiwes had been quick to talk to prosecutors and share details of his obsession.In 2015, a German police officer was convicted of murder for killing a man he met in an internet chat forum devoted to cannibalism. Prosecutors said the victim had fantasised about being eaten but there was no evidence the suspect actually did so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d30fbba6eea55ae5aa4ef485fbb6dd7b3bf0f7d2/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=796e7dda2f4b7bef4fcab7d85039b19e","title":"republicans coronavirus covid 19 governors mask mandates","story":"Some GOP governors who for months toed Trump’s line on coronavirus, are performing U-turns on mask-wearingAfter Republicans won big on election night in the state of Iowa, in America’s heartland, Governor Kim Reynolds claimed vindication for her light-handed approach to the coronavirus pandemic.“It was a validation of our balanced response to Covid-19,” Reynolds said of the vote. “One that is mindful of both public health and economic health.”That was two weeks ago. Since then, the trajectory of the pandemic in Iowa, as elsewhere in the American midwest, has taken a sharp and tragic turn.Like other Republicans torn between fighting the pandemic and fighting the culture wars, Reynolds spent months dismissing the need for a mask mandate in her state, calling it a “feelgood” measure. But new warnings from local hospitals of a dangerous overload finally drove Reynolds to reverse course this week.“The pandemic in Iowa is the worst it has ever been,” she said. “No one wants to do this. I don’t want to do this.”The reluctance to “do this” is not exclusive to Reynolds – but it is exclusive to one of America’s two major political parties.Since the start of the pandemic, Republican officials across the country, cowed by Donald Trump, conspiracy-swayed constituents and lesser political calculations, have resisted asking voters to take personal action to stop the spread of Covid-19. Until recently, many of those states had escaped the worst consequences of the official dereliction, enjoying some luck in the mysterious dynamics of the virus’s spread.But with the arrival of cooler temperatures, an increase in indoor activity and widespread pandemic fatigue, that story has changed terribly this fall, as public health experts predicted it would. With each passing week, the unwillingness of elected Republicans to act against the virus is taking an increasing toll, health experts say.And the mistrust in basic public health guidelines that Republicans have sown has a further, potentially destructive cost yet to be paid: the climate of mistrust seems likely to hamper the country’s imminent effort to escape the virus’s clutches through universal vaccination.“It’s not just that the anti-mask, anti-distancing, anti-testing Republicans are wrong as a matter of public policy,” tweeted Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative anti-Trump Bulwark. “It’s not even that they lack empathy for those who suffer. They relish their lack of empathy. They glory in their callousness. They are proud of their inhumanity.”Some Republican governors, such as Reynolds and the North Dakota governor, Doug Burgum, have been driven by desperation to reverse themselves on masks. But others, such as Nebraska’s governor, Pete Ricketts, a major Trump backer, have resisted a general mask mandate.In lieu of such a mandate, hundreds of Nebraska healthcare workers signed an open letter published on Wednesday by the Omaha World-Herald, pleading with the public to mask up.“Your frontline health care workers are exhausted,” they wrote. “We are scared that the hospitals won’t have the space and people to meet the ever-growing demand. We are seeing many deaths and will continue to see many more.”There is no clear map of the United States overlaying holes in political leadership with spikes in coronavirus cases, because the virus does not respect political boundaries, said Lawrence O Gostin, founding O’Neill Chair in global health law at Georgetown University and a professor of public health at Johns Hopkins University.“It’s really hard to make a direct and causal connection between governors in conservative states that refuse to order masks, distancing, or send out mixed messages” – and cases, Gostin told the .“But make no mistake about it, those are causing enormous flare-ups in the United States, because we can’t think of the state as some self-contained unit. They affect other states and they affect the entire country.”Republican resistance to masks, social distancing and other coronavirus mitigation measures began early on in the pandemic. The purely political prism through which Trump saw the pandemic set the tone.In private, Trump said the virus was “deadly stuff” that “goes through the air” – while in public he said the virus was a “hoax” that would “disappear”. Any Republican governor who dared split with the party line, such as Ohio’s Mike DeWine and Maryland’s Larry Hogan, drew wrathful Twitter fire from the White House.Republicans also took up coronavirus rejectionism as an ideological battle, equating basic health precautions with existential threats to personal freedom.The conservative supreme court justice Samuel Alito said last week that safety measures had exacted “previously unimaginable restrictions on inidual liberty”. The attorney general, William Barr, called prospective stay-at-home orders “the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history” apart from slavery.The partisan chasm produced a striking scene on the Senate floor this week, when the Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown asked the presiding senator, the Alaska Republican Dan Sullivan, to wear a mask to protect the health of staff members required to be present in the chamber – including one staffer seated directly underneath Sullivan.“I don’t need your instruction,” Sullivan barked in refusal.Ted Cruz, another Republican senator, piled on. “Sherrod Brown is being a complete ass,” he tweeted.The senators had been called to the chamber to confirm a final few Trump judges. But that fact only underscored the Republican failure, in the eyes of critics, to meet Democrats halfway on a new and direly needed coronavirus relief bill, which appears a dead letter.For millions of American lives touched by the coronavirus, it was too late to correct the failure to stand up protocols for masking and social distancing, testing and contact-tracing. But negative consequences of the culture war around the pandemic could still lie ahead, damaging the national vaccination effort.“And so the splintered, fragmented approach in the United States will only look worse when it comes to a vaccine distribution.”Gostin said he hoped that Biden would convene a Covid-19 summit at the White House including all the governors and public health commissioners.“It’s going to be hard,” said Gostin, “but I think that’s our only hope to meet what we face: the most daunting logistical challenge for a vaccine campaign in our lifetime.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97c5c436d15c9f91cfae1ea3f4548cd28654e612/0_492_7283_4369/master/7283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=339c7c7c9942f8176df7502b583cddd5","title":"women in mid 30s may never know equal pay in their working lives","story":"Women in their mid-30s will never know equal pay in their working lives if progress towards tackling the gender gap is not accelerated, according to new analysis.To mark Equal Pay Day, the day that women in effect stop being paid because of the gender pay gap in the UK, Labour has said 8.5 million women will go their entire careers without receiving equal pay.Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said the UK was at a “coronavirus crossroads” on the path towards gender equality.“The second world war gave birth to the welfare state the winter of discontent led to a new Thatcherite era,” she said. “The coronavirus crisis puts us at a crossroads again, and it is clear that this applies to the gender pay gap.” Marsha De Cordova, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, said: “The government has failed to tackle the gender pay gap and has ignored the impact this crisis has had on women. We need urgent action to modernise equal pay legislation and restart pay gap reporting.”“Women are still being undervalued, underpaid and to add insult to injury, there is little if any progress on the gender pay and bonus gaps,” said Dr Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the trust.A spokesman from the Government Equalities Office said the government was “fully committed” to providing equal opportunity in the workplace: “As we look to unite the country and recover from the pandemic it is key that companies embrace flexible working initiatives which have a positive impact on recruitment and the productivity of staff.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/210610b2256d17e4a4e69417929af2d0deb9838b/238_539_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8fd197644458b07e35d59c6152b430a","title":"send in your questions what do you want to know about coronavirus in the uk","story":"We want to hear about the questions you have around long Covid, testing and any other related issues If you’d like to ask  reporters a question about the impact of coronavirus in the UK, we’d like to hear from you.As contact tracers in England try to reach up to 50,000 people who should be self-isolating after a spreadsheet blunder that led to coronavirus cases going unreported, we would like to hear about any questions you have about Covid-19.If you have any questions about long Covid, about UK government policy, how contact tracing works, when we might see a vaccine, or any other question, please get in touch and our experts will try and provide the answers.You can send us your questions by filling in the form below.

That all changed with the lockdown.“The move to emergency remote teaching, learning and assessment was a huge challenge, but one which all academic staff engaged in overnight. The response by both the staff and students, to such a dramatic transition to remote online space, was phenomenal,” says Dr Mary Fitzpatrick, head of the Centre for Teaching and Learning at University of Limerick (UL).As colleges began moving their programmes online for the final semester, educational priorities quickly changed. Gone, all of a sudden, were the classes, lectures, tutorials, trips to the library and group-work meetings.In came video conferencing, online quizzes, virtual learning platforms, specialised simulations, asynchronous and synchronous teaching.The shift to online does have its benefits.“Some of the benefits of course delivery online include flexibility: students can work at their own pace, supporting independent and self-directed learning, and allowing them to fit learning around the rest of their lives and unlimited access to practice and revision resources,” says Dr Alison Hood, dean of teaching and learning at Maynooth University.Many will be unfamiliar with some of the terms associated with distance learning, blended learning and remote learning but this is likely to change in the coming months and years as these learning strategies grow in popularity. Many of these concepts are interrelated – and they all involve learning – but what do they mean inidually and how do they relate to each other?Distance learningA 1960s Australian children’s television series might not be the first thing that springs to mind when we consider the merits of distance learning. Yet for many, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo is where they first came across the practice.The series told the story of a young boy called Sonny and his adventures with his pet kangaroo friend Skippy. Sonny lived in a remote national park and had to use a two-way radio to connect with his teachers in order to receive his education. Thanks to the development of internet technology, distance learning has advanced quite a bit since then. The tools and methods traditionally associated with it such as correspondence courses, educational television and, in the case of Sonny, two-way radios, have now largely been replaced by online learning platforms. In many cases, the interactive online learning environment used to deliver distance learning courses is now the very same platform used by students who attend the face-to-face courses traditionally associated with third-level education.Colleges and universities have improved their ability to deliver distance learning programmes while at the same time offering comprehensive support for students. In short, distance learning is when students don’t attend classroom lessons in person. Instead, they receive instruction, and learn and study from home.Classes are usually conducted over the internet and students can submit assignments remotely. As distance learning offers students the flexibility and convenience of not having to be physically present in the learning institution, the advantages are numerous. Students can access class resources from a single location, they can save substantially on transport and fees as courses offered through distance learning are usually significantly cheaper than traditional classroom-based pedagogy.Blended or hybrid learning This is where the traditional form of face-to-face learning converges with the newer methods of remote and online instruction. Blended learning uses technology to improve the learning process and is the model most likely to be adopted by third-level institutions as ongoing social distancing requirements limit the possibility of traditional in-person lectures taking place in the medium term.Blended learning is customisable and, as a result, a wide range of approaches to the method means the balance between in-class teaching and the use of technology varies from programme to programme. Advocates say it offers the best of both worlds. The curriculum is usually delivered through a combination of classroom-based lectures, online lectures and the use of other online resources. Ideally, these course components complement each other to strengthen the overall outcome.Blended learning also offers students the benefits of in-class engagement with instructors with the flexibility of online learning. The degree to which the course is blended depends on the course programme and the institution in question. Most Irish colleges and universities offer a suite of blended learning courses across undergraduate, graduate and professional level categories. This is likely to continue even when social distancing measures are in place.eLearning Short for electronic learning, eLearning is a term that essentially means learning with the aid of digital tools. It has its roots in distance learning. The internet has contributed greatly to a marked growth in the use of technology for the delivery of education over the past decade and has helped the development of new models of teaching, improved instruction methods and the possibility of better student outcomes.Technology is at the centre of eLearning and without it the programme could not be delivered. Students use computer and internet technology to access the curriculum from outside the traditional classroom.It is widely seen as a flexible and efficient way of delivering the curriculum as most people with a stable internet connection can access these tools and participate in some form of online learning.It is also efficient. Students no longer have to worry about attending a lecture or class at a set time, they can review lecture videos as often as they like, there is no commute time and it can help develop time-management skills. Unsurprisingly, it is often the preferred option for students who are working or who have other constraints on their time.This form of learning is also used in a wider context. In recent years we have seen a sharp growth in demand for online digital courses. Courses called Moocs (Massive Open Online Courses) first appeared in the late 2000s and were seen as a disruptor which would widen access and lower the costs associated with traditional modes of learning.Critics sometimes cite poor student engagement as one of the greatest drawbacks of eLearning. In traditional classroom settings, students can raise their hand and engage in face-to-face interaction with their instructor but it is not as easy to raise the hand digitally in an eLearning environment.The very nature of the approach means students will invariably spend a lot of time on their own in front of the computer screen and the lack of social interaction can lead to a sense of isolation.Tools do exist to facilitate better communication however and the development of video software now means students can interact directly with instructors through video-link. Depending on the type of course undertaken, practical assessments can be difficult to cater for well.Emergency remote teachingNot to be confused with distance learning or online learning, emergency remote teaching is a measure that is adopted in response to a crisis where the curriculum has to be rapidly moved to a virtual online setting.The unintended consequences of emergency remote teaching can include a failure to meet the expectations that students had at the outset of the course. Simply broadcasting a lecture with the aid of a video conferencing tool or uploading a presentation to a virtual learning environment is not the same as presenting course content that has been planned, developed and designed for delivery via a framework that best enables learning to take place.The sudden change in delivery model can mean a change to how course material is absorbed by students and it can also mean a change to the assessment model which can be disruptive for those students who had prepared for another format entirely over a lengthy period of time.The needs of all students might not be met by sudden change, and unexpected barriers such as the digital ide and other inequities can arise. There is also the danger that in the absence of a coherent emergency plan that teaching objectives can shift from the achievement of pre-defined learning goals to enacting a crisis management approach instead.While the process of moving from an established teaching method to an unfamiliar new platform can be difficult, emergency remote teaching can be a useful learning experience as instructors quickly learn to apply what works and discard what doesn’t.Synchronous learningSynchronous learning is a term used to describe a method where students engage in learning at the same time but not in the same place. Synchronous learning usually involves the use of online tools such as chat and videoconferencing where students and teachers can interact in real-time during class. Class activities typically take place through the use of dedicated virtual learning environments (also known as learning management systems) such as Brightspace, Moodle or Canvas.Asynchronous learningAsynchronous learning is a term used to describe a method where students engage in learning at different times and locations. Asynchronous learning often utilises elements such as email, pre-recorded video and other tools such as online discussion forums that facilitate the sharing of information.Learning management systemSometimes referred to as virtual learning environment or virtual learning platforms, learning management systems are web-based software platforms which facilitate the delivery of course content. Platforms provide teaching tools and supports but also allow course instructors to track student performance over time.Multiple formats such as video, audio and text are catered for and students can be assessed through tools such as online quizzes and questionnaires.They are in widespread use at third level and can be used to deliver asynchronous or synchronous-based courses. Systems such as Brightspace, Canvas, Moodle and Blackboard have built-in tools that allow instructors to deliver lectures by video or audio, facilitate discussions and even track student performance.Virtual classroomA virtual classroom is an online learning environment where students interact in real time with the instructor and with each other. Usually delivered via videoconferencing tools, virtual classrooms are also a feature of learning management systems. Students can also usually interact and ask or answer questions by using a chat window. Presentation tools such as PowerPoint or whiteboard tools can usually be utilised by the teacher during class. It is also possible during a class or lecture to operate break-out rooms where students can work together or where the instructor can interact directly with an inidual student.WebinarA webinar is a class in which participants view the same screen at the same time. Very useful in a classroom setting, the instructor controls proceedings and participants can communicate through the use of interactive features such as chatrooms, polls and quizzes.Collaborative toolsThis is usually a reference to materials such as PDFs, slideshow, spreadsheets, presentations, images or text documents. These tools are usually found as a feature within the learning management systems.Flipped classesA feature of some blended learning approaches where lectures are replaced by classes or tutorial-type settings. Students consume content – perhaps by viewing a lecture video or completing an assignment – at home before engaging in analysis and discussion in the live class setting. The practice results in more face-to-face time and affords the instructor greater flexibility in being able to engage directly with students during class, and it can help increase student engagement as they are required to prepare material ahead of the class."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Sentinel 6 will help identify impacts on Ireland and improve weather forecastingUCC energy institute warns of need for agile system due to weather-dependant generationHighly unlikely Ireland will meet overall 2020 targets even with Covid-19-driven drop"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

The remote meetings between the two ministers and senior executives at the companies took place on Friday morning and both providers are understood to have accepted that the level of care they have offered in recent months has fallen far short of what is required. Mr Varadkar and Mr Ryan both expressed their dissatisfaction with how they have been conducting themselves and highlighted the escalating level of complaints from their customers. They pointed out that in a year which has seen a massive increase in remote working people need to be able to rely on their broadband provider more than ever before. At the meeting the companies highlighted challenges posed by customer care staff working remotely as a result of the pandemic although many of the problems that have been identified by customers trying to resolve issues or even attempting to make contact with the companies predate the current crisis. Speaking after the meeting the Tánaiste said poor customer service was “something which is causing a huge amount of frustration for people.”He said it had been “good to hear first-hand from the companies” and he welcomed moves put forward at the meetings which “set out their plans to resolve the issues causing problems, so I really hope we see things improving for customers soon.”Mr Ryan said it had been important “to relay the level of dissatisfaction being experienced by people who are doing their best to work from home”. Like Mr Varadkar he welcomed the solutions being worked on by both companies and he expressed optimism that there would be “improvements in the near future”. He said that while the ongoing roll out of the National Broadband Plan was important consumers needed “existing services to offer a high standard of service”.Last week eir came under fire in the the Dáil with Mr Ryan describing its customer service as “totally unsatisfactory and something the company is going to have to address”.The Ceann Comhairle Sean Ó Fearghaíl went further and said its service was “appalling” adding that growing consumer concern about the company raised “profound questions as to whether ComReg is doing its job”.For its part, ComReg condemned as “completely unacceptable” ongoing problems which Eir customers have experienced when trying to make contact with the provider and defended its role in ensuring communications companies deal with customers complaints in an efficient and effective manner.Vodafone said it didn’t wish to comment on the substance of the meeting.eir has been asked for comment.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4414993.1605897300!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"foster defends ni s lockdown measures as business owner express frustration","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tArlene Foster said while Ministers did not want to introduce further restrictions   ‘it was necessary, unfortunately, to protect our health service’.  File photograph: Kelvin BoyesPress EyePA WireThe North’s First Minister has defended the decision to introduce tough new lockdown measures to limit the spread of coronavirus only a week after less stringent measures were blocked by her party. Ministers agreed on Thursday to a two-week shutdown from November 27th which will close hospitality, churches and non-essential retail. Arlene Foster said the Executive had received new medical advice around the reproduction (R) number and the number of people in hospital. This was, she said, “all new information, and it’s in that context we had to make the decision. “We only do what is necessary, unfortunately what we’re having to do next week is necessary, and that’s why we have to take those very, very difficult decisions,” she said. The change in stance comes only a week after the DUP twice used a controversial cross-community mechanism to prevent the extension of current restrictions. The bitter and damaging split in the Executive resulted in a reluctant compromise which extended the measures until Friday, when cafes and close contact businesses were allowed to resume trading. This was to have been followed by the complete reopening of hospitality businesses from November 27th, which has now been scrapped. Business owners expressed anger and frustration that cafes and close contact businesses, which reopened on Friday under the limited relaxing of the rules agreed last week, will now be required to close again after only a week. Concerns have also been raised that the one-week window for shops, cafes and close contact services to remain open will encourage a rush of shoppers. The chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neil, said the change in the rules was a “disaster” and the sector needed an urgent financial rescue package. “All trust in the Executive by the hospitality sector has been wiped away,” he said. “We were told that Christmas trading would be saved, that is now gone . . . We have been left with no trade, no hope and a huge amount of redundancies on our hands.” Latest deaths and cases Twelve further coronavirus-related deaths were reported by the North’s Department of Health (DoH) on Friday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 913. A further 369 people were confirmed to have the virus. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Ms Foster justified her party’s change in position and said the evidence had changed. While Ministers did not want to introduce further restrictions because they “realise the impact it will have . . . it was necessary, unfortunately, to protect our health service.” She said the Minister for Health Robin Swann had brought forward evidence that the R number was higher than had been hoped - at 1 rather than between .8 and .9 - which “causes us concern in terms of transmission of the virus.“The numbers are staying pretty static in relation to positive cases at present, but when we look at our hospital numbers they are at our highest they have been,” she said. However the Minister for Infrastructure Nichola Mallon of the SDLP disputed this, saying the situation had not changed and ministers had been advised five weeks ago to impose a six-week lockdown. “The regrettable thing is that we should have been taking decisions like this long before,” she told the BBC. “We should not have had the shambles of last week and the distress that has caused to businesses and people, but we have got the right decision now and it’s very clear that we need to be putting financial support packages in place.” The Deputy First Minister, Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill, also defended the new restrictions, saying the decision was “difficult” but was taken “on the back of strong medical and scientific advice, and was necessary.” The chair of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, Dr Tom Black, welcomed the decision but said it should have been taken five weeks ago. “We need this lockdown if we are going to take the pressure off the hospitals. The hospitals are at breaking point,” he said. “The decision that was made five weeks ago was the wrong decision, it was not severe enough at the time and it needed to be taken earlier. “We should have brought in more severe measures five weeks ago if we were going to stop this happening now. It’s happened, we have a lot of hard work to do.”– Additional reporting - PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4414962.1605895094!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish people donate 2 5m to native american tribe devastated by coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMonument Valley is home to the Navajo Nation, who have been badly affected by coronavirus. Photograph: Eric BaradatAFPFew places in the world have been as devastated by coronavirus as the Navajo Nation which s part of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico in the southwestern United States.Just 175,000 people live in an area the size of the Republic of Ireland. The nation has been hit by two waves of the virus, the second and latest even more severe than the first.To date, 13,744 people have tested positive the disease, one person in 12, and 605 have died, the equivalent of 13,000 in this State.Currently, numbers are increasing by 150 a day and the nation is back in a complete lockdown for the next three weeks.Poor infrastructure and high levels of deprivation and chronic illness have made the nation particularly susceptible to the disease.DonatedWhen the Navajo appealed for help in March as the virus first threatened, that appeal was noted in Ireland. Irish people recalled the support of another native American people, the Choctaw Indians, during the Great Famine 175 years ago.The money to the Navajo gofundme appeal started to come in from Ireland and it keeps coming. A cursory glance reveals names including Amy Heffernan, Breige McGinn, Eamon Gallagher, Alan Slattery, Brian McCarthy, Seamus Traynor and Dermot Sweeney who have donated in the last 48 hours alone. U2 drummer Larry Mullen has also donated $100,000 (€84,000) to the fund.To date “at least” $3 million (€2.5 million) has come directly from Irish people living in Ireland, according to the Navajo Nation attorney-general Doreen McPaul.“It is quite overwhelming at a human level. It is the good in all of the bad that is going on,” she said.Along with the online donations, people have sent money in envelopes while apologising for not being able to get to a bank, she said.In addition, the Irish Cultural Center in Phoenix and the McClelland Irish Library next door volunteered to act as a drop-off hub for supplies. So many people donated food, cleaning materials and clothes in May that the National Guard in Arizona was called on to drive two huge articulated trucks the 4½-hour journey to the Navajo reservation.“The Irish people and the Navajo people have a shared history of oppression. What Ireland has done with the Navajo nation is something that I am really proud about,” said Ms McPaul whose father is a dual citizen of Ireland and the United States. She is part-Navajo and part-Irish.“It makes me incredibly proud of these cultures that are coming together in a time of great need. The Irish response has been truly phenomenal, really incredible.”Ms McPaul, whose ancestry is from Armagh and Laois, said the impact of the virus has touched every Navajo family, including her own. She has lost an uncle to the virus recently.“We have very hard, tragic stories where multi-generations of a single family have been lost. Great-grandparents, grandparents and grandkids were all wiped out.”Ms McPaul said the Navajo Nation opted for fundraising when it was unable to access funds from the Trump administration. She said native peoples in the US are waiting for the federal government to release $600 million (€506 million) to fight the pandemic.The Navajo people in Arizona took their revenge on President Donald Trump by handing the critical state and its 11 electoral college votes to president-elect Joe Biden.VotersOf the 67,000 eligible Navajo voters in Arizona, 90 per cent of them turned out to vote and between 85 and 90 per cent of them opted for Biden, who won the State by just 12,000 votes. By contrast Hillary Clinton won the Navajo vote by 55 per cent to 45 per cent.Navajo Nation president Jonathan Nez told The  that a record number of citizens had cast their ballots.“Overwhelming they decided on the Biden-Harris ticket because of the outreach we did for everyone that wanted to vote. Navajo people were tired of being ignored by the administration and wanted no more of this devisiveness. People cast their vote for change and healing.”Mr Nez is the co-chair of the Arizona Democratic vote and a member of the electoral college who will vote for Mr Biden to become the 46th president of the United States. He also addressed the Democratic National Convention in August.“We had people inspired to vote. I sat down with the DNC chair Tom Perez and let me that they didn’t do so well in the last election because they took the native American vote for granted.“I told them that they needed to go into tribal nations to encourage and inspire a big turnout.“We are proud that the Irish people are friends of the Navajo people They assisted us when our federal government would not.”The Navajo gofundme page can be found here: gofundmefxjgrfa-navajo-amp-hopi-families-covid19-relief-fund?utm_sourcecustomer\u0026amputm_mediumcopy_link-tip\u0026amputm_campaignp_cp+share-sheetStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4414674.1605880941!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rt%C3%A9 presenters apologise after social distancing breaches","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDavid McCullagh and Miriam O’Callaghan  with their colleague (centre) at a gathering.

Photograph: Odd AndersenAFP via Getty ImagesBerlin police have remanded in custody a 41-year-old maths teacher suspected of eating another man he met in an online chat forum.Investigators identified the man, identified only as Stefan R, as part of their search for another man, identified as Stefan T, missing since September 5th.The case gathered pace on November 8th when passersby discovered a human leg bone, stripped of tissue, in a city park. DNA testing revealed it to belong to the 44-year-old missing Stefan T.Two teams, starting at two different points in the city, were both lead by sniffer dogs to the same apartment of Stefan R, in a high-rise building in the eastern district of Lichtenberg.When they raided the apartment on Wednesday they discovered a chest freezer with traces of human blood and a bone saw. In his cellar room were 25kg of cleaning chemicals which the man insisted were to “manufacture soap”.After studying online chat transcripts between the two men, in which they reportedly agreed to meet, police believe it is likely Stefan R ate parts of the older’s man’s body – and dissolved the rest in the bath.“On the basis of the bone found, with its tissue completely missing, as well as other indicators, we have the strong suspicion that Stefan T was a victim of cannibalism,” said a police spokesman.Martin Steltner, spokesman for Berlin’s state prosecutor, described the events as a “missing person case that has taken a tragic turn”.\u0026nbspThe two men met on an online platform popular with men and women and there were no indications that the dead man was a member of any Berlin fetish groups, said Mr Steltner .He said investigators were working on the assumption that Stefan T was killed in Stefan R’s apartment, given the equipment and blood traces found by a forensic team.Stefan R was brought before a judge on Thursday and remanded in custody on suspicion of sexualised murder. The state prosecutor said there were no clues pointing to other motives, such as revenge.The case has echoes of the “Rotenburg Cannibal” case from 2001 when a Berlin telecommunications technician, Bernd Brandes, was dismembered, killed and partially eaten by Armin Meiwes.After two trials, Meiwes was sentenced to life in prison.

It’s Mafia-esque. It just smacks of what the Church has been found to be doing by the Inquiry - which is protecting its reputation at all costs. That’s what they’ve done this morning. “They protect Vincent Nichols by shutting down any questions about his role in this and I think until there’s a change in leadership, any statements that are made are meaningless. “In not allowing journalists to answer questions that they would like to ask themselves and on their behalf, it’s just another form of silencing victims from speaking out.”Mr DesForges told the press conference that all questions had been answered and muted The  following an attempt to ask Cardinal Nichols questions. Following Friday’s press conference, Richard Scorer, solicitor at Slater and Gordon who represents 32 survivors of Catholic Church abuse in IICSA, said: “The attempt by the Cardinal’s press officer to prevent questions by journalists is an absolute disgrace, and indicative of an authoritarian mindset which seeks to silence any questioning or accountability – precisely the mentality which created the abuse crisis in the first place. It confirms the Cardinal’s total unfitness for office. “The Cardinal’s attitude seems to be that if he avoids questions, this will go away. It won’t. Survivors are determined to ensure that the hierarchy is held to account. “Their courageous campaigning will continue, and church leaders will not escape accountability by hiding from public view.”In response, Mr DesForges said: “I am sorry you feel your question was not answered previously” citing reasons of “limited time”. “I can only apologise for any misunderstanding around the press conference…  Cardinal Nichols has given substantive answers to questions about his position.” In its final review of the Catholic Church, the government-ordered IICSA found that it “betrayed” its moral purpose by prioritising its reputation above children who had been sexually abused by priests. “Child sexual abuse,” the damning 162-page report concluded, “was swept under the carpet”, as authorities “turned a blind eye and failed to take action against perpetrators”.Furthermore, the Inquiry found that the Holy See and the Apostolic Nuncio, its ambassador to the UK, did not provide a witness statement to the Inquiry despite repeated requests. They had been asked about the Apostolic Nuncio’s involvement in handling child sexual abuse allegations at Ealing Abbey, as well as other issues. The Inquiry said it “could not understand their lack of cooperation”.Despite facing calls to resign from victims following the publication of the report, Cardinal Nichols said he would continue in his role as Archbishop of Westminster. He offered his resignation to the Pope when he turned 75, in accordance with custom, and which occurred on the day the IICSA report was published.However, it remains unknown whether the Cardinal discussed the forthcoming IICSA report with Pope Francis when he offered his resignation.Cardinal Nichols has also yet to respond to the IICSA’s criticism of the Holy See.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"daily covid infections england show significant drop first time","story":"It is estimated that there are now 7.4 new infections per 10,000 people each day, down from 8.75 the previous week. The figure peaked at 9.52 for the week ending October 23. Katherine Kent, the co-head of analysis for the Covid-19 Infection Survey, said: There are early signs that the national level of infections in England might be levelling off, but this hides a lot of variation at a regional level.  Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King\u0027s College London, said: The reason we are now seeing an overall \u0027R\u0027 value of 1.0 in England is because numbers are falling in the North, rising in the Midlands and East but staying flat in the south of England. The continued rise in the Midlands, despite national lockdown, is concerning. The good news is that cases in the over-60s, which account for most NHS activity, are remaining low. According to the Government hospital data, admissions have only gone up slowly and most parts of the NHS have spare capacity, so as we head into December it looks like the hospitals won\u0027t be overwhelmed with Covid admissions. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"plants may evolving hide humans exeter university study finds","story":"Plants may be evolving to hide from humans, a new University of Exeter study has found.Scientists discovered that the Fritillaria delavayi flowers blend more closely into their surroundings in areas where they are more frequently harvested.The flowers are picked to use for Chinese medicine, and appear to have evolved to camoflage in areas where doing so would protect them.The report, published in Current Biology, suggests humans are driving evolution of this species into new colour forms because better-camouflaged plants have a higher chance of survival.The study was carried out by the Kunming Institute of Botany (Chinese Academy of Sciences) and the University of Exeter.It\u0027s remarkable to see how humans can have such a direct and dramatic impact on the colouration of wild organisms, not just on their survival but on their evolution itself, said Professor Martin Stevens, of the Centre for Ecology and Conservation on Exeter\u0027s Penryn Campus in Cornwall.Many plants seem to use camouflage to hide from herbivores that may eat them - but here we see camouflage evolving in response to human collectors.It\u0027s possible that humans have driven evolution of defensive strategies in other plant species, but surprisingly little research has examined this.To conduct the research, scientists measured how closely plants from different populations matched their mountain environment and how easy they were to collect, and spoke to local people to estimate how much harvesting took place in each location.They found that the level of camouflage in the plants was correlated with harvesting levels, and that more-camouflaged plants also took longer to be detected by people.Fritillaria delavayi is a perennial herb that has leaves - varying in colour from grey to brown to green - at a young age, and produces a single flower per year after the fifth year.The bulb of the fritillary species has been used in Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years, and high prices in recent years have led to increased harvesting.It is believed that the bulb affects the heart and lung meridians, or energy pathways in the body, and that it can treat various lung conditions, including asthma, bronchitis, tuberculosis , and coughs of any type.Like other camouflaged plants we have studied, we thought the evolution of camouflage of this fritillary had been driven by herbivores, but we didn\u0027t find such animals, said Dr Yang Niu, of the Kunming Institute of Botany. Then we realised humans could be the reason.Professor Hang Sun, of the Kunming Institute of Botany, added: Commercial harvesting is a much stronger selection pressure than many pressures in nature.The current bioersity status on the earth is shaped by both nature and by ourselves.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public sector workers whingeing pay freeze may change tune reality","story":"Why do so many people think the suppression of the economy is no big deal?  On October 29, two days before the Prime Minister announced our second national lockdown, one opinion poll found two thirds of people in favour of the idea and only a quarter against.    There are, I think, two answers to the above the question. Firstly, large numbers of people, who do not have a thorough scientific education, are susceptible to any doom-laden modelling  that is put before them, however dodgy it may be. They are frightened, and allow Covid 19 to over-rule all other concerns.    Secondly, we haven’t really seen the bill for lockdown yet. It’s sitting on the table, folded up beneath a couple of After Eights, but we haven’t got round to looking at it.We won’t be able to ignore it for much longer, though. And when we do, don’t be surprised if those attitudes towards lockdown shift dramatically. Just look at the fury and bewilderment among workers and unions as the Chancellor floated the idea of a pay freeze for public sector workers.     For months, many in the public sector have felt insulated against economic pain. They kept being paid on time, whether they were doing much work or not. Their final-salary pensions stood aloof from turmoil on stock markets.   Making nonsensical statements like “lives are more important than the economy” was a luxury they could – or felt they could – afford.   Raise the prospect of a pay freeze, though, and money does very much seem to matter. Nothing should be allowed to infringe what unions see as their members’ human right to ever-increasing living standards. But public sector unions should be grateful if their pay is merely frozen, given the scale of the crisis that is about to wash over the public finances.     A public sector pay freeze for 3.7 million workers, calculates the IFS, would save £3.4 billion next year. That is less than one per cent of the forecast budget deficit for this financial year: £370 billion and rising.I know it has become fashionable to say that public debts and deficits don’t matter, that interest rates are so low that we can go on borrowing endlessly. And, of course, if we run out of pension funds and other investors willing to lend the government money at derisory rates, we can always get the Bank of England to print the stuff. But while you can print money, you can’t print resources – which is why efforts by nations to print their way of out fiscal difficulties tend to end in cataclysmic inflation. Ultimately, the gulf between government revenue and spending will have to be bridged – and the Chancellor will have to trim the nation’s cloth accordingly.It isn’t just public sector workers who have had a sense of unreality during lockdown. At one point we had nine million workers on furlough – the new, politer word for unemployment benefit. In many cases they were being paid 80 per cent of their salaries to sit in the sun. How many of their jobs really still exist is something we will only discover once the furlough scheme is finally wound up.What will we think of lockdowns when we have several million unemployed, and public services are having to be slashed to stave off our creditors? My guess is that many of those who now approve of closing down the economy will start to take a very different view once they are losing their jobs, or having their wages frozen, and public services are being slashed. When the reckoning comes, the government should be prepared for a wild swing in public opinion.  Ministers will be forced to answer the question: was it really necessary to destroy so many livelihoods and run up so much debt?More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"saudi hosts muted virtual g20 amid covid 19 rights criticism","story":"The G20 Riyadh summit this weekend is unlikely to be the high-profile event Saudi officials hoped would rehabilitate the kingdom’s reputation and highlight Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s reform plans. But it is coronavirus rather than the chorus of criticism that has taken the shine off the conference, which is now being held virtually.   Saudi’s involvement in Yemen’s war, the ongoing detention of women’s rights activists, and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate has provoked global outrage since 2018, when many leaders snubbed Saudi’s 2018 “Davos in the desert” conference.While some returned for the 2019 Future Investment Initiative, Saudi had hoped that hosting this year’s gathering of the world’s largest economies would cement its re-acceptance in the global community. But rather than photo ops of world leaders at Saudi palaces, the summit on November 21-22 will more resemble a series of Zoom meetings, chaired by Saudi’s King Salman.   “Covid put a ner in the works,” said Michael Stephens, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “They know that, and I think everyone\u0027s been honest with them that it\u0027s been a bit of a washout.”On the agenda of the 15th meeting of the group focused on international economic cooperation, Saudi has placed a Covid-19 action plan to finance pandemic preparedness and restore growth, including debt relief for the poorest countries.But critics arguing that hosting the summit also plays an important role in Saudi Arabia\u0027s multi-billion dollar “reputational laundering” strategy have called on other G20 leaders to hold their Saudi hosts accountable for human rights abuses. Among those calling for a boycott is a Saudi Bedouin tribe which has been evicted to make way for a futuristic megacity, US Congressmen alarmed by Saudi’s failure to resolve the Khashoggi murder, and the fiancee of the slain journalist.Hatice Cengiz gave virtual testimony to the UK parliament on Wednesday, asking Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to attend.“I ask that you do not sit at the virtual table with him, he’s not a man you want to be friends with,” she said, referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who the CIA assessed was likely responsible for ordering her fiancee’s murder.“The crown prince must be challenged mercilessly over the shocking murder of my Jamal. He must feel that the consequences are severe and momentous.”Human rights defenders had hoped the international attention attracted by the summit might encourage Saudi leaders to free political prisoners, including women’s advocate Loujain al-Hathoul, whose family said began a hunger strike on October 26. But after the  reported on November 10 that the Saudi ambassador to the UK said the kingdom was considering clemency for detained female activists, the embassy in London denied his comments.Ms al-Hathoul will be spending her 920th day in prison when Saudi Arabia hosts the summit, her sister Lina Alhathloul said. “Is anyone going to ask about her?”The kingdom meanwhile may be hoping to ignore the criticism with a business-as-usual approach, something that even critics acknowledge may be effective strategy. Oxfam said this week that other G20 countries have sold more than $17 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia since it became involved in Yemen’s war in 2015, noting that the same countries had given Yemen a third that amount in aid. The British charity hopes that the election of Joe Biden – who was said he would stop selling arms to Saudi to be used in Yemen – represents an opportunity for the global community to take a fresh approach towards Saudi and human rights after the Trump-era.“Although American foreign policy doesn\u0027t change much, we must try,” said Oxfam’s Yemen country director Muhsin Siddiquey.The kingdom may be concerned at the exit of a US president disinterested in human rights, said Adam Coogle, deputy director of Human Rights Watch in the Middle East. “There’s no doubt that the Trump administration set a policy that it didn’t matter, that Saudi could literally do anything in terms of violating human rights – up to murdering a journalist in a foreign country  – and the US wouldn’t do anything.”He continued: “They got a blank cheque from Trump, they absolutely are concerned about Biden coming in. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the US is going to take a hard line with them.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish tories want christmas silent boris","story":"Next year’s Scottish Parliament elections will be decisive, determining which of the parties – Labour or Conservative – will be crowned as the official opposition. That, I fear, is the only contest in prospect.The winner of the main contest will, of course, be the SNP, an outcome so certain that it hardly warrants any serious speculation. Whether Nicola Sturgeon’s party secures more than half the seats in the parliament is of some interest, arguably, but beyond that the fight is to see who gets to ask the first question at the weekly session of First Minister’s Questions.Douglas Ross, the recently-elected leader of the Scottish Conservatives, is hoping to make the case for his own party to hold onto the prize it won in 2016, when his predecessor-but-one, Ruth Davidson, led her party to its best election result in the devolution era, pushing Scottish Labour into a dismal but deserved third place. As the Scottish Conservatives head into their annual conference this weekend, Ross has his work cut out.Davidson worked hard to portray herself and her party as arch devolutionists, finally beginning to shake off the long shadow of the Thatcher. Major and Hague years when the party stood solidly against devolution in principle. Ross wants to continue Davidson’s good work, but that’s quite difficult when your UK leader (and prime minister) chooses to describe devolution as a “disaster” and as Tony Blair’s biggest mistake in government.“Aha!” said every journalist, SNP member and most of Scotland’s civic society when reports of Boris Johnson’s ill-judged Zoom call comments emerged. “We knew it! The Tories never change – devolution would never be safe in their hands.”  Johnson’s outburst was in character and most of us suspected that, like Blair himself, the prime minister was never convinced of the wisdom of devolution. But thinking thoughts and saying words are very different things, as Ross has undoubtedly reminded Johnson since then.The Scottish Tory leader has some things going for him. For a start, his is the only party in Scotland willing to defend the Union as it is his main opponents, Scottish Labour and the Scottish Liberal Democrats, are still traumatised by their catastrophic losses since 2015 and blame it on their support for the (victorious) Better Together campaign in the independence referendum campaign in 2014.Labour claim to support the Union, but only a hypothetical version of it, one that they want to be transformed out of all recognition through “federalism” and which in all likelihood will never actually exist. Even under UK Labour’s new management, Keir Starmer has equivocated on whether a majority for the SNP next May will legitimise Sturgeon’s demand for another referendum. Which leaves the Tories as the only option for Scots sick to the back teeth with referendums.There was a time when political leaders in Scotland had to go through the motions of talking about policies beyond independence. That’s no longer the case they all still do, of course, because that’s expected in polite (and also in Scottish) society. But no one really believes that your average Scottish voter cares about anything other than flags any more.While Douglas Ross will attempt to grab voters’ attention with talk about tougher prison sentences for those who attack emergency workers and a swathe of other decent ideas, it is the constitution that will decide the votes in the dysfunctional political arena that is Caledonia. Given Johnson’s comments and the bouts of pearl-clutching and petticoat-grabbing that accompanied them, Ross’s job has undoubtedly been made more difficult. But only among those voters who were always unlikely to consider the Scottish Conservatives as an option in the first place.The challenge facing Scottish Labour is more difficult than the one facing Ross in at least one respect: Labour has successfully alienated everyone, whether pro- independence or pro-Union. Ross’s party can still make a pitch to pro-Union voters and may even hold onto some pro-devolution voters who oppose independence and who are capable of acknowledging that Johnson’s comments do not presage a new UK government campaign to dismantle Holyrood and repatriate the Stone of Destiny back to Westminster Abbey.Further, Ross is that rare politician in Scotland: someone who is prepared to give up his seat in the Commons to focus on Holyrood, something that plays well among Scots who resent the assumption that MPs are the “senior partner” to local MSPs. He has also been willing – indeed eager – to criticise the prime minister when he needs to, though to be fair, his position would have been untenable if he had not done so.Perhaps more importantly, Ross is a relatively new, and therefore interesting, face. Unlike Labour’s Richard Leonard, his rival for the position of Leader of the opposition at Holyrood, Ross has not yet been written off as an also-ran. The degree of abuse he receives is in direct proportion to the degree to which his opponents worry about his effectiveness. Douglas Ross has not had a good week. But he has played a bad hand as well as anyone could, and he seems up for the fight. All he needs now is a bit of luck. And a commitment from Boris Johnson to remain quiet until after next May.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch now know data put us lockdown","story":"Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced England would enter a second lockdown on October 31, flanked by Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, and Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. The trio presented a series of slides, filled with data and graphs justifying heavy restrictions across the nation, which they said were necessary for curbing the virus.However, the data wasn’t as up-to-date as it could have been and new figures paint a different picture, suggesting the Government\u0027s tiered system was in fact working, begging the question: was a second lockdown needed?Downing Street itself was forced to reissue two of the graphs presented which were misleading, and Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick later told the Science Select Committee a projection of 1,000 deaths per day, was more accurate than the 4,000 figure presented at the press conference. Watch the video above as Camilla Tominey es into the data which sent us into a winter lockdown. For more videos from The , subscribe to our YouTube channel.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bakers union debate ending relationship","story":"NewsBakers’ Union to debate ending relationship with Labour in wake of Corbyn whip rowIn a blog post titled Who Exactly Are Labour Representing  Bakers union president Ian Hodson said accused the current party leadership of \"a clear agenda to alienate any MP considered to be supportive of socialism and move them to the backbenchesmirrorShareCommentsSubscriptionsSign OutByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  NOV NewsEx-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had his suspension lted - but has not had the whip restored \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Allies of Mr Corbyn have stepped up their pressure on Mr Starmer in a bid to get the ex-Labour leader reinstated. Members of the left-wing factions on Labouraposs National Executive Commitee said they expected the whip to be ed as a consequence of a decision by an NEC  on Tuesday. They claimed Mr Starmer was guilty of the exact type of political intervention that had been criticised by the EHRC.“The decision of the leader the following day to withhold the whip from Jeremy Corbyn MP is an act of deliberate political interference in the handling of a complaint,” the letter to the general secretary, David Evans, said.“It defies the decision of the NEC , is a matter of double jeopardy that flies in the face of natural justice, it undermines the rule book and it is precisely the type of action found to be unlawful indirect discrimination by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission [EHRC] report.” On Thursday, Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said a “politicised” disciplinary process had resulted in Mr Corbyn’s readmittance to the party after his suspension – imposed in the wake of a damning report into the handling of anti-Semitism in Labour – was lted on Tuesday. The Labour leader said on Wednesday morning that he would not restore the whip, meaning Mr Corbyn will continue to sit as an independent MP and will not be part of the Parliamentary Labour Party .Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, an ally of Mr Corbyn, questioned whether Sir Keir would ever have been elected leadermembers knew how he would act against his predecessor.She said excluding Mr Corbyn was “wrong” and Sir Keir’s actions were “no way to unite the party”.

The Home Secretary apologised today after the damning inquiry found she broke the Ministerial Code of ethics. But the PM Johnson overruled the inquiry and decided he didnapost believe Ms Patel broke the Ministerial Code - despite writing in it himself that there must be no bullying. In a bizarrely worded message to MPs he then ordered her Tory colleagues to rally around her. His message read: Time to form a square around the prittster. Asked what the PMaposs potentially stationary themed message meant, his Press Secretary Allegra Stratton told reporters that it was the PM asking colleagues to support her on a testing day. She said: He said it to recognise that today she is coming forward with a full and frank apology. He wanted her parliamentary colleagues to support her on what will be a testing day for her. Ms Stratton added that Mr Johnson loathes bullying and would encourage companies and organisations up and down the land to take these things very seriously The civil servant who led the inquiry resigned instantly after the PMaposs shock decision, which came at the end of Anti-Bullying Week. Sir Alex Allan said in a statement: “I recognise that it is for the Prime Minister to make a judgment on whether actions by a minister amount to a breach of the ministerial code. “But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the Prime Minister’s independent adviser on the code.” After months of delay, No today finally released just a one-and-a-half page summary of the report Sir Alex launched back in Spring.Downing Street is refusing to publish the full report in a move Labour has branded a prime ministerial cover-up.Labour leader Keir Starmer demanded the full report is published urgently and the PM and Ms Patel face questions on their conduct on Monday in the Commons.If I were Prime Minister, the Home Secretary would have been removed from her job, Sir Keir said. It is hard to imagine another workplace in the UK where this behaviour would be condoned by those at the topThe Government should be setting an example. Instead, it is one rule for Boris Johnson and his friends, another for everyone .The Prime Minister has previously said he ‘loathes bullying’. Yet when one of his own ministers is found to have bullied their staff he ignores the damning report sat on his desk and instead protects them. In the interest of transparency, the report into Priti Patel’s conduct and any drafts should now be fully published and the Prime Minister and Home Secretary should come to the House on Monday to face questions on their conduct.

The Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England used the aviation metaphor as multiple studies emerged suggesting England’s lockdown may be having an effect. The ONS said there were an average of , new cases per day of Covid- in England in the week to November  - down from , per day the week before. And Matt Hancock said average new cases that test positive per day are now at , - down from , a week ago. This is clearly flattening,” said the Health Secretary. “The peak is clearly... we’re clearly near the peak of this second increase and the second wave. Meanwhile Mr Hancock confirmed the Pfizer BioNTech breakthrough vaccine has begun the process of regulator approval in the UK. “If the regulator approves a vaccine we will be ready to start the vaccination next month with the bulk of the rollout in the new year,” he said. “We’re heading in the right direction but there is still a long way to go.” Turning to a flight metaphor, Prof Van Tam added: “Do I believe we’re now on the glide path to landing this plane  Yes, I think I do. “Do I accept that sometimes when you’re on the glide path you can have a side wind and the landing is not totally straightforward - of course. “And this is the real science world we live in. But yes, I think we’re on the glide path. Over.”  But Jonathan Van Tam also warned there were no guarantees about when a vaccine will start being rolled out. He also warned it was “pointless” to speculate about how many doses will be available and when. He said the matter is now in the MHRA’s hands, saying: “It will happen at the speed of science. “It has to happen in their own time when they are ready and we have to leave them and trust them to get on with that.” Mr Hancock later admitted: “It is absolutely a question for [the MHRA] how long they take, I am not going to pre-judge that at all.” The Pfizer jab is one of two vaccines that has passed Phase  trials, but neither are yet approved by regulator the MHRA and the other won’t be available until Spring. Concerns have been raised about the vaccine priority list - which puts all healthy over-s at the very bottom, while placing over-s, care home residents and NHS staff first. However, Prof Van Tam said the the dference between being higher or lower on the vaccine priority list will be one or two or three weeks. It won’t be very long at all.”  As of three weeks ago, just before England’s national lockdown, the R number across the UK fell to .-.. That means every  people with Covid- pass the virus to  or  others on average. The R number is now below  in the North West, sitting at . to ., after the region was hit with tougher Tier  restrictions before lockdown. SAGE today said the R number may already be below  in England, but hasn’t shown up yet in official data. “These figures are promising and they show that the second peak is flattening,” Mr Hancock said.

And we want to know what restrictions you would expect to be imposed where you live after the lockdown ends. The scientist behind the original national lockdown has warned much of England will need to go back into Tier  or  measures even when the current restrictions end next month. Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, says the move would be needed to stop infection levels rebounding immediately and undoing any benefits from the second national lockdown. The epidemiologist, whose modelling led to the original lockdown in March, told theinfection rates appear to be plateauing and may be starting to go down slowly. A halving of infection prevalence over the four weeks would be a positive result, he said. Dubbed Professor Lockdown, Prof Ferguson said it was too early to tell how much of an impact the second national lockdown will have by December  but claimed the previous tier system had made a dference. We now have clear evidence that Tier  measures were working to bring down infection rates in some areas, he said.

The box sat in their house for two days after being delivered before arachnophobe Gemma opened it and spotted the giant, cm wide spider on the packing paper. Gemma, , screamed and flung it across the room fearing there could be more of them inside. She then called her husband who was at work and he raced home.

I was at work she rang me and said aposI have just had the most scary thing happen to meapos. She has arachnophobia because of this bad experience with spiders as a kid.

I donapost know where the package came from in the world. It must have been alive when it got in there.  There are a iety of huntsman spiders - the second largest in the world - which are native to Australia and Asia. Spider expert Samantha Nixon, based in Brisbane, Australia said it was a Huntsman - renowned for their size and speed. They are known to bite humans but are unlikely to kill them. She said today: This is indeed a Huntsman spider. Huntsmans are a widely distributed family. Although they are large and fast, their venom is fortunately harmless to humans. At most it causes some mild to moderate pain. The couple - parents to Abigail, seven, Isabel, five and seven-week-old Jenson - ordered the £. Set of three Light-Up Christmas Boxes last Saturday.

It’s important to act now as the changes will take place – whatever agreement the UK reaches with the EU. Customs declarations are complicated and require specialist skills. Mistakes can be costly and inevitably lead to delays. This is why many businesses don’t try to manage the process alone, but get help from businesses like freight forwarders, express operators and customs agents. What are freight forwarders  Freight forwarders aid businesses throughout the process of importing and exporting goods. Enlisting the assistance of a freight forwarder is an effective way to ensure your company continues to run smoothly, following the end of the UK’s transition period. Davies Turner is one of the largest independent freight forwarding firms in the UK. It’s been handling international freight and logistics for over  years.  “Our job is to move goods around the world for importers and exporters,” explains global sales and marketing director Alan Williams. “We make that process happen, and that includes giving advice on customs procedures – going out and at the country of destination.” Companies such as Davies Turner can help classy goods for customs purposes, sort out paperwork such as customs invoices, offer consultancy services or explain dferent regimes and rules. Such is the demand for this expertise that the company has seen a  per cent increase in enquiries since the UK’s departure from the EU was announced.  So what type of companies does Davies Turner generally work with  “We get a lot of business from blue chip clients such as Tesco because they know our processes fit with theirs,” Alan says. “However, smaller businesses tend to get us to do everything for them. We’ll hold their hand through the whole process.”  Experts save you time, trouble and money Small businesses may be concerned that paying a freight forwarder is an expensive option, but Alan Williams puts that into context: “Customs clearance can be a complex process and it almost certainly doesn’t pay to do it yourself. “Mistakes can have major financial implications, or can delay shipments, and most importantly lose the goodwill of valued customers.” So the message is clear. British businesses may save themselves trouble and moneythey get expert guidance to work through the imminent changes to importing and exporting between the UK and EU. Use this tool to find out what YOU need to do before Jan   The government has launched a quick and easy online transition checkereverybody can use - be it a business or an inidual.

I called every day to speak to the doctor, I wanted results, I wanted things to go quicker and a friend even offered to pay for me to go privately. Luckily Lymphoma is a slow growing cancer but I just had to wait. Toni said she doesnapost want what has happened to her to paint the NHS in a negative light. The service saved her sonaposs le eight years ago after he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at just  months old. She added: My mum is a nurse and the NHS saved my sonaposs le so I feel like I canapost be angry.  But the human part of me canapost help but be angry when cancer is involved and it feels like a Covid patient is more important than me. Toni had to wait to begin her chemotherapy as she was too unwell but on November  she began her six months of treatment. She will have a scan after two months to seeitaposs working as the cancer has also spread to her lungs and partially paralysed her left hand. Toni said: When my chemo started I cheered a bit. I was like aposyes itaposs startedapos because I honestly thought the news of the second lockdown would cancel that as well. As Toniaposs treatment is still in its early stages, it is not yet known what her prognosis is however, Hodgkinaposs lymphoma is treatable.  The five-year survival rate for people with stage four is around % but numerous factors such as age can play a part. Dr Phil Wood, Chief Medical Officer, Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, said: We are very sympathetic to Ms Cunningtonaposs situation. We are pleased she is now receiving the appropriate treatment and care, and wish her the very best. At the time of Ms Cunningtonaposs outpatient appointment in March, we regrettably had to make dficult decisions - like other NHS hospitals - to suspend all non-urgent appointments due to the pandemic.

Nicolas Aujula, who also says he foretold Donald Trumpaposs defeat in the US election, claimed back in  that an aposinfluenzaapos disaster would dominate the world, which he says predicted Covid-. The -year-old from London also claims to have seen global protests - and now he has looked ahead to what  will hold. Nicholas, a past le regression therapist, hypnotherapist and psychic astrologer, said: Some of my visions are very literal.\u2028\u2028 Others are more symbolic and open to interpretation, almost like a dream with a hidden message.\u2028\u2028 One thing people have asked me about a lot this year is the coronavirus. I have visions of it plateauing after the new year and infection rates being right down to the point where they are under control by the spring.\u2028\u2028 But, I predict that the panic and restrictions around the virus will go on until . In his past lives, Nicolas believes he was an Egyptian queen and a lion. He says he first became aware of his psychic talents as a child but had his first truly overwhelming experience when he was .\u2028\u2028 Still unable to explain what happened, he said: “I had this almost out-of-body experience and I was able to see several of my past lives.\u2028\u2028There’s no logic to it, but I knew what I was seeing was me in a previous le.\u2028\u2028 “I’ve had thousands of past lives. I’ve been an Egyptian queen, a maid, a teacher in the French Revolution, a deer, a lion and even lived in another galaxy. Nicholas was so overwhelmed by his experience that he scrapped his plans to study history and economics at university and decided to train as a past le regression therapist.\u2028\u2028 Since then he claims he has had regular visions, some of which he says come to him through dreams and others that strike when he is out and about.\u2028\u2028 He believes his gt has helped him to predict some of the most biggest events of recent times.\u2028\u2028 Nicholas explained: “Back in , the word influenza kept coming to me. It stuck in my mind, as it’s not a word I’d use. If I was talking in everyday le, I would just say flu.\u2028\u2028 I saw it as a global disaster, linked to meat or livestock.\u2028\u2028 The Covid- pandemic has been compared to the Spanish flu outbreak, hence the word influenza and some people think it originated at a wildle market in Wuhan, China.\u2028\u2028  “I also envisioned the defeat of Donald Trump. The US election was obviously very neck-and-neck, so it was surreal seeing my vision come true when Joe Biden finally took the lead.”\u2028\u2028 The psychic also believes that a vision he had in  of global protests is partially linked to the Black Lives Matter movement.\u2028\u2028 It isnapost just big world events that Nicholas claims his visions can predict. He says an image of a cupcake-style garment also came to him - and he insists this was actually of the dress Ariana Grande wore to the  Grammy’s, which went viral.\u2028\u2028 Nicholas said: The image of protests that I saw is one that has now become very important, as all over the world this year, people have been taking to the streets, standing up and raising their voices.\u2028\u2028 Black Lives Matter has been a huge movement but there have been other protests around the globe too, such as those in France and Nigeria.\u2028\u2028  One other thing I saw before  was a hospital in flames. At the time, I thought it’d mean a literal fire – but now I think it might’ve been symbolic of the way the NHS, and health services around the world, were pushed to the edge by the virus.\u2028\u2028 Similarly, I had a vision of World War Three but perhaps that wasn’t a war between countries, but instead a war against Covid-. Now, Nicolas has shared his forecast for  - and he claims protests around the world will continue for the next two to three years after he says he had visions of civil unrest.\u2028\u2028 He also predicts a mass movement of people, with “thousands” moving countries in one go.\u2028\u2028 Nicholas explained: I’m seeing people moving somewhere for a better le, almost like a mass exodus. I’m not talking a few hundred – I mean thousands.  Elsewhere, he says he has seen visions of Rishi Sunak resigning, a fire raging through New York, USA – and potential heartbreak for three A-List celebrities.\u2028\u2028 Nicholas said: I keep getting the words ‘Tom Cruise’ and ‘heart’ coming to me. Maybe that’s literal and he’ll be poorly with a heart problem, or maybe it’s metaphorical and he’ll go through a break-up or something.\u2028\u2028I’m also seeing romantic heartache for Natalie Portman and Kim Kardashian. Who knows, maybe she will split with Kanye West Some of Nicolas’ more light-hearted visions include Peter Andre relaunching his music career, a new Harry Potter book, and a digestive biscuit going viral for reasons that are, as of yet, unclear to him.\u2028\u2028He also sees big things on the horizon for the Royal family - especially Meghan Markle.Nicholas explained: \u2028\u2028I’m getting visions of Meghan Markle appearing on screen somewhere, doing some sort of tell all interview, where she spills secrets about the Royal family.\u2028\u2028 However, some of the psychicaposs predictions are dark.  Nicholas said: I have had a couple of quite horrid visions – one of a male world leader being assassinated. I couldn’t see who it was, but sensed it sent shockwaves through the world. Obviously I hope that doesn’t come to fruition. I’ve also had a vision of a world summit being plagued by a sex scandal and, a rise in far-right politics, particularly in southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and a volcanic eruption leading to major weather changes.\u2028\u2028 And Iaposve had the words ‘pig flu’ come to me and seen images of mass panic. I don’t think it will be another virus, but I can imagine the reaction will be alarmist, given what’s happened this year. He explained that when he has a vision – particularly one that could be indicative of a newsworthy event – it is dficult to silence the logical side of his brain, which is battling to make sense of what he has seen Despite his predictions, he insists he is “not special” – instead believing that all of us possess the same abilities but that scepticism prevents us from trusting them.\u2028\u2028 Nicholas said: All I do is tune in to something we all have. We live in a logical world and so don’t always see these messages, but I think we all have that sixth sense in us.\u2028\u2028 "},{"url":null,"title":"raunchy new advertising campaign ode","story":"NewsRaunchy new advertising campaign is ode to nations property porn addictionThe campaign shows the real fantasy millions of Brits have when they slip between the sheets at night and it has more to do with roll top baths than rolling around with a lovermirrorShareCommentsSubscriptionsSign OutByGemma Francis:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start inCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video uk-property-prn-habits-revealed-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Places of sanctuary and respite were effectively allowed to become death traps. The list of failings by ministers and officials is shocking. The National Audit Office found that, at the height of the outbreak, , hospital patients were discharged to care homes without being tested. As late as March , Public Health England guidance claimed it was “very unlikely” that people in care homes will become infected. Staff were left without protective kit as resources were erted to the NHS. Only on June  was testing offered to every resident in a care home in England aged  or over. As a result of these blunders, an estimated , residents died between March and June. Legal proceedings have now started and it is right ministers are facing this reckoning. They failed some of the most vulnerable people in this country at the time they most needed protection, care and compassion.  Parking row OUR brilliant NHS staff have given everything since this pandemic started. Working under enormous pressure, the very least they deserved was not to be clobbered by having to pay for hospital parking. Health Secretary Matt Hancock claimed this charge has been lted in England. Yet our investigation found at least three NHS Trusts who have brought back staff parking fees. Those working on the front line, many on low wages, are being unfairly penalised. Mr Hancock needs to keep to his word and sort this out once and for all.

Officials confirmed the results on Thursday, after a six day hand recount of the stateaposs  million ballots that had only taken place because sitting president Donald Trump continues to try and undermine his opponentaposs victory.The now, one term leader had made baseless allegations Georgiaaposs vote tallies were suspect because of aposwidespread fraudapos. The recount reaffirms that Biden has captured  electoral votes to Trumpaposs  in the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the winner of the election, well above the  needed for victory. Georgiaaposs audit, launched after unofficial results showed Biden leading Trump by about , votes cast, ended with  Biden winning by ,, and the state is expected to certy Bidenaposs victory on Friday. But the billionaire Republicanaposs relentless refusal to accept reality shows no sign of stopping, with more than two months still to go in his aposlame duckapos presidency. Amid a series of losses in court, Trumpaposs campaign has now shted to a new aposstrategyapos that relies on pressuring Republican officials in crucial states to ignore the election results altogether and intervene on his behalf. The campaign has filed multiple lawsuits to try to challenge the results in battleground states that Biden won, as election officials across the country have affirmed that there is no evidence of major irregularities. Judges in three states delivered new legal setbacks to the campaign on Thursday, rejecting claims of improper vote counting. Biden called Trumpaposs attempt to reverse the results totally irresponsible.  It sends a horrible message about who we are as a country, said the president-elect, although he expressed no concern that the plan would succeed in preventing him from taking office on January . While legal experts see Trumpaposs last-gasp effort as unlikely to succeed, they say the strategy represents an unprecedented assault on the countryaposs democratic institutions by a sitting president. The Trump campaign has already asked a judge in Pennsylvania, where Biden won by , votes, to declare Trump the winner, allowing the Republican-controlled legislature to choose the stateaposs  Electoral College voters.

Waiting for exam results, starting driving lessons, having to talk to a crowd, all of these things are far from relaxing for many of us. And when it comes to job interviews, no matter how many youaposve had over the years, you always fear coming out with the wrong answer or making a huge mistake. From suffering gastro issues to accidentally talking up your credentials in the heat of the moment - the scrutiny of a job interview can get the better of any of us. Now one woman has shared the single mistake a candidate made which meant he had no chance of getting the job. On the aposLe Pro Tipsapos forum on Reddit, she warned readers to ensure they treat everyone with respect. She wrote: Today, a candidate blew his interview in the first  minutes after he entered the building. He was dismissive to the receptionist. She greeted him and he barely made eye contact. She tried to engage him in conversation. Again, no eye contact, no interest in speaking with her. What the candidate did not realize was that the receptionist was actually the hiring manager. She called him back to the conference room and explained how every single person on our team is valuable and worthy of respect. Due to his interaction with the receptionist, the hiring manager did not feel he was a good fit. Thank you for your time but the interview is over.  Be nice to everyone in the building. Lots of people on Reddit agreed that it was essential to ensure you were polite to everyone - which sounds like a no-brainer. One person wrote: BINGO! After a candidate leaves one of the first things those involved in the interview will do is speak to the receptionist and ask them how the interviewee treated them.  The person could be the best person for the position butthey treated the receptionist like c***.....THEY ARE DONE! If they treated the receptionist like s*** when on their best behavior imagine how awful they will treat them once they get the job. Same goes for any cleaning staff. They are consulted, too. Another shared: I got hired once, because I held the door for the janitor coming in with his cart. The receptionist said, thataposs so nice of you.. I said it was just decency, but apparently she was in the hiring manageraposs ear later that day. The choice was between me, and someone more knowledgeable, but he was a p****... So they went with me. After some questions, the woman confirmed that they did further research into the candidate.

Investigators believe Christian Brueckner, , killed Madeleine, then three, after abducting her from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in May . Last year, he was found guilty of the  rape of a -year-old American woman in the same Portuguese resort and sentenced to seven years in jail, at a court in Brunswick, Lower Saxony. A federal court in Karlsruhe, a city in south-west Germany, rejected Brueckneraposs appeal against the conviction and confirmed the sentence on Friday.  The judgment comes weeks before German national Brueckner, who is also serving a prison sentence for drug trafficking, could have been freed. German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the McCann investigation, said the one year and seven months Brueckner has already spent in jail will count towards the seven-year jail term. Therefore, he should be in custody until spring , he told the PA news agency. We are pleased that the judgment is upheld because it shows that the Brunswick judiciary has worked objectively and carefully.  Earlier this week, Brueckner was treated in hospital after suffering two broken ribs in a court incident before ing for a hearing the same day, according to authorities. Brueckner - referred to as Christian B in Germany due to the countryaposs strict privacy laws - was identied as a murder suspect in the Madeleine McCann investigation in June. Mr Wolters has previously said investigators have concrete evidence, but not forensic evidence, that he killed her, and prosecutors do not have enough evidence to charge him. The politan Police maintain their active investigation into Madeleineaposs disappearance, Operation Grange, is a missing person inquiry as there is no definitive evidence whether Madeleine is alive or dead.  Brueckneraposs rape appeal was previously sent to the European Court of Justice , in Luxembourg, to decide on a point of law relating to his extradition to Germany from Portugal and later Italy. According to court documents, he was extradited from Portugal for sexually abusing a minor in June , then travelled to the Netherlands and Italy while still on probation after his release.

He had to get to know us and we had to get to know him.“It was definitely a case of trying to put my best foot forward and trying to make a good first impression.“The gaffer is very much ‘play what you see’ whether that’s playing from the back or taking a quick goal kick just do it.“He gives us keepers the freedom to do itwe think it’s on and ask questions later.“Sometimes it’s about managing the game.”PODCAST: Dundee United will benefit from Lawrence Shankland’s Euro dream \" title\"#PODCAST: Dundee United will benefit from Lawrence Shankland’s Euro dream # # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-united  podcast-dundee-united-will-benefit-from-lawrence-shanklands-euro-dream-and-marc-mcnultys embed # secretKqQomfv\" data-secret\"KqQomfv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"And the former Aston Villa keeper believes the team as a whole have adapted well to the top flight following promotion, registering three clean sheets in a current four-game unbeaten run.Siegrist continued: “I was really looking forward to it and we had that feeling of accomplishment finally getting out of the lower leagues.“We wanted to play the biggest teams in the country so it’s definitely a step up.“All the little mistakes get punished on a bigger scale so you just have to be switched on all the time.“We’ve lost goals where it’s just been that one instance where we’ve switched off a little bit but I think we’ve learned from it with all the consecutive clean sheets.“The boys have really improved.“You’re coming up against better opposition which means they’re going to have more of the ball, pass it around you a bit and get closer to your goal.“Last year, other teams weren’t getting to our box and had to shoot from  or  yards.“That’s a big dference I’ve experienced so far.”Particularly in the last few games, Siegrist has drew widespread praise for his performances, with Mellon branding him ‘the best in the league’.The big goalie admits he was flattered but would like some easier days out in the weeks ahead as the Swiss has saved a blunt Terrors side countless times in recent weeks.“It’s nice to hear but I just try to do my job every weekend,” he added.“The goalkeeper sometimes gets the headlinesyou have a clean sheet and a couple of saves like the striker gets the headlinehe scores a tap-in from two yards out.“But it’s a team game.“It drives me on to do even more, get better and improve.“I’d definitely like to have some quieter nights!“I think there’s an adjustment period, personally, because I’ve never experienced the Scottish Premiership and didn’t know what I was getting into.“We had a taste with the play-offs and cup games against Hibs. They showed pretty clearly it’s a more physical league but what the goalkeeper gets measured with is clean sheets.I think I had to prove myself anyway because we were stepping up a league and I wanted to build on what I felt was a good season for me personally.“I can measure myself against other established or international goalkeepers in the league and compete against good strikers, top teams and better players.“The aim is trying to push my boundaries, develop my game and have more consistency.“I’m pretty sure my team-mates think that way, too.“It’s not always pretty but you can have pretty football and zero points or you can have a scrappy game and take a win or a point.“I know what I would prefer.“We can’t forget this is our first year at this level and, so far, we’re doing good.”Ahead of Saturday’s visit of bottom side Hamilton to Tannadice, Siegrist insists they are aiming to continue their positive run of form.He commented: “The trend is going upwards, it’s positive and I think coming into pre-season we were one of the teams that started early compared to others.“We maybe had three or four weeks more to get up fitness levels and start the season so well.“That only gets you so far, though, and other teams catch you up.“Kilmarnock and Rangers were reality checks for us like ‘this is le in the Premiership’.“It’s always going to be up and down the first season back up because those - wins against Arbroath aren’t going to happen in the Premiership because the opposition is better.“You’re not going to score in the th minute until you adjust to this level of football.“I think we’ve done a really nice job of adjusting ourselves and dusting ourselves down, keep going and the manager sets the route.“We want to improve in pursuit of the next level as a football club and as players.”Brian Grant exclusive: Dundee United loans manager on transforming his ‘inbetweeners’, embracing modern game and Tangerines’ youth model\" title\"#Brian Grant exclusive: Dundee United loans manager on transforming his ‘inbetweeners’, embracing modern game and Tangerines’ youth model# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-united  interview-brian-grant-dundee-united-loans-manager embed # secretnlubXgT\" data-secret\"nlubXgT\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

from sir david attenborough","story":"A north-east pupil is #over the moon# after receiving a signed photo from his idol, legendary naturalist and filmmaker Sir David Attenborough.Keen environmentalist Rory Sorrie, , created a short film highlighting five simple steps people can take to protect the planet.His mum, Megan, shared the movie on social media and the Daviot Primary School pupil, who wears a Superman costume in the film, decided to write a letter to the natural historian in the hope of a response.To the family#s shock and delight, a signed photograph of David Attenborough arrived through the letterbox on Monday.Mum Megan said: #Rory is obsessed with the ocean and saving the planet, and he wants to be David Attenborough when he grows up.#To earn his beaver badge, he had to do something around recycling, whether it be a poster, slideshow or a video.#He chose to make a movie which my husband helped him with.#I shared it on social media and it just went nuts, I was getting so many messages from friends.#It grew arms and legs and everybody suggested we should try and get David to see it.#Rory decided to write a letter instead and on Monday a signed picture arrived.#Megan described how her son was #over the moon# with the autograph.She said: #He pretended to faint, he was so shocked and couldn#t believe it.#When he opened the photo he shouted #It#s David Attenborough!##He was over the moon. It was almost even better than receiving a letter.#He#s going to frame it and put it on his bedroom wall.#I#m sure David has millions of fans so it#s not every day you get an autograph from him.#Ambitious Rory wants to be a marine biologist when he grows up, with a part-time job at Pets at Home.Megan added: #I think Rory really likes David#s tone and his manner. The Blue Planet programmes are his favourite because he loves the ocean.#The plastic pollution side of things was horrendous and that was probably what made him start really caring about the planet.#His favourite place to go is Macduff Marine Aquarium and any time that we go to the beach he picks up rubbish.#She added: #I#m so proud of him. What started as a rainy day beaver badge activity has turned into something much bigger.#It#s simple things he has identied which can help make a dference andthe message gets out to people, then that#s amazing.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

I hope to become a goalie like him one day and even to captain my team.“I’m really chuffed to be an AberDNA Junior member and to be part of the club.“I can’t wait to get back to watching games at Pittodrie with my dad.”Launched in March of this year, the Dons’ free AberDNA Junior under- initiative now has members from all corners of the globe.The Dons, and the Evening Express and Press and Journal are working together to promote the scheme, with a view to reaching more than , primary school pupils in Aberdeen City and Shire and signing up , by August .Each member will be invited to Pittodrie to ceremonially “Sign for The Dons” when it is safe to do so, in addition to being able to enjoy two free home matches as part of their membership.Junior members will also be issued a welcome pack, which includes a limited-edition collectable card featuring club captain Joe Lewis, while a second limited edition collectible card, featuring Ross McCrorie, has also been made available.To get involved with AberDNA Junior:For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Everyone from managers and players to supporters must get together to demand the government produces a plan.This inertia cannot go on.Scottish football and the clubs are fundamental to the lives of millions and clubs like Aberdeen do valuable work within the communities.That has to be taken into consideration by Holyrood and they have to give a clear plan, and hope, that supporters will be allowed back in.Aberdeen had  fans inside Pittodrie against Kilmarnock in September and it was a resounding success.I was at that Kilmarnock match and I am hugely confident the stringent safety measures the club have in place could safely accommodate a few thousand fans.There was social distancing, staggered entries, sanitiser stations, fans did not sing or chant and details of every supporter inside Pittodrie were known to the club as they were season ticket holders.There is no point having another test event with  supporters as we already know that works.Pittodrie holds around , and I see no reason why Aberdeen cannot build up to crowds of ,, which would be a quarter capacity.Each stand could hold , fans and that would allow enough space for social distancing.I find it frustrating that people can travel in aeroplanes in a confined space with no social distancing.Yet supporters are still not allowed to attend a match outside with strict safety measures and social distancing in place.Football seems to be very low down on the pecking order of priorities inside Holyrood, which is a huge disservice to the role clubs play in millions of lives.Aberdeen have revealed the devastating impact with projections they are set to suffer an operating loss of £m for the financial year.That is unsustainable.The Scottish Government must act – before it is too late.Scotland’s inability to take their scoring chances cost them promotion to Nations League A.It was disappointing to lose to both Israel and Slovakia as that allowed the Czech Republic to leapfrog Steve Clarke’s side to the top of their Nations League group.However, we didn’t play badly in either defeat. For me, Scotland’s only out-and-out striker is Leigh Grfiths and he is not yet fully fit.Hopefully he will be firing on all cylinders for the Euro  finals.Despite two losses let’s focus on the positives. We are going to the Euros – it’s a huge achievement.Aberdeen must go on the front foot on Sunday and put undefeated Rangers under pressure at Ibrox.The Dons are dangerous going forward and have to utilise that against Steven Gerrard’s in-form side.This is an opportunity for Aberdeen to make a statement as to their strength in the Premiership this season.Rangers are  games undefeated in all competitions this season, soAberdeen can end that run it would really hammer home the strength of this side.It can be done Aberdeen have the players to cause Rangers and Celtic problems.The Reds are at their best when they are seen as underdogs, which I am sure many outside Pittodrie and the Granite City see them as.Derek McInnes’s side are playing well, have confidence, are creating chances and look solid at the back.Unfortunately McInnes will be minus Ross McCrorie, Jonny Hayes, Dylan McGeouch, Niall McGinn and Marley Watkins for the match.Four are injured, while McCrorie is unavailable due to the terms of his loan agreement with parent club Rangers. Thankfully, the Scotland Under- captain will sign a permanent three-year deal with Aberdeen next summer.McCrorie has been superb for Aberdeen and will be missed at Ibrox, but this is the opportunity for replacements to come in and stake a claim for a regular start.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Surely the simplest solution would be a tunnel from Arrochar to Butterbridge, or from Ardgarten to Butterbridge. From Arrochar may be better as the route is more of a straight line.As a former resident of Tarbert now living in Taynuilt I now live less than  miles from a tunnel into and below a hillside at Loch Awe, Ben Cruachan. I refer of course to the tunnel constructed in  with less sophisticated tools than available now.I have also seen an article on the building of tunnels for carrying water from Loch Katrine to Glasgow, much earlier than , again using more primitive equipment. In addition to those tunnels look at the construction of the railways during the railway early years. There are examples of tunnelling all over the world where knowledge could be given to the Scottish government.Cost should not be an issue, as it seems none is being spared at present to no avail.Dugald McDougall, TaynuiltSir,Many years ago I suggested, to an MP, option seven in the list of options being considered in the list released by the Scottish Government.I also pointed out that the bridging of the Loch Fyne narrows at Port Ann could be used to generate hydro power by incorporating hydro tunnels at the base of the crossing and thus provide income to alleviate costs, while the same time reducing travels costs for commercial and private users and consequently help the environment by reducing pollution.I received favourable opinion from a prominent firm of civil engineers and a #like# from a government official. To give that person credit, however, there were very many more pressing problems.I also note that the simplest idea I have since offered – that of a tunnel through the saddle to connect the ends of the existing military roads below and on each side of the Rest and thereafter, upgrading the old military road to A road standard is not even considered.This begs the question why is  Government in such a mountainous region of Scotland so averse to tunnels In the time since I made such suggestions, more than enough money has been drained away in making repairs.Capt Jim Currie, former Tarbert harbour masterScotland has around , older military veterans and Age Scotland believes that many go without the assistance available to them, such as priority healthcare for conditions linked to their service, help with dental and eye care, housing and financial support.We have launched a revamped version of our popular free #Veterans# Guide to Later Le in Scotland#.The guide features information about support and opportunities available to every older person in Scotland, plus content specically for British Armed Forces veterans including regulars, reservists, National Servicemen and merchant navy who have sailed in support of a British military operation.It is most relevant to veterans aged  plus, but much of the content will be of interest to veterans aged -, regardless of how long ago, or for how long they served.If you are aged  or older, live in Scotland and have served in the armed forces, the guide will be most relevant to you. It doesn’t matter how long ago, or for how long, you served: you may have had a military career, a short period of national service, been a reservist, or even supported a military operation with the merchant navy.Many people we’ve met through our Veterans’ Project left the armed forces with little or no support for readjusting to civilian le. Today, the military is more proactive in supporting that transition, but older veterans it seems were, by and large, left to it.Our guide aims to ensure veterans have a better experience when making the transition to later le.Veterans and their families can request a free paper guide by calling Age Scotland on     or visiting www.age.scot veteransguide.

There is little regard for the needs of a rural population, but statistically it sounds fantastic.Yes, there is a move towards doing business online, but how refreshing would it be to see big business using some imagination. As many people have said, it is time to think dferently about service provision in rural areas. The traditional model, hamstrung by the profit imperative for shareholders, is not working for Argyll.Why not share premises, equipment and facilities  Could we be providing certain services ourselves and let big business scuttle off to the cities More positively, we read in this week#s edition about the incredible efforts of people like Yvie and wee Rowan in Achnamara.

Insidious bullying is commonplace and can take the form of exclusion from conversations in the office, belittling remarks and the like. The distress caused to the inidual is often substantial, not to mention the impact on work performance.There is no doubt that the culture of an organisation is dficult to change and takes time. One would presume that exit interviews when staff leave, to assess the extent of the problem, are already in place. So far as promotion to management posts is concerned, greater emphasis might now be given to leadership styles.We are told that areas for improvement are being addressed and it would be of interest to hear further about practical examples of progress.Norman Beaton MA, Chartered FCIPD, ArdrishaigSir,The UK State pension is the worst in Europe, despite the UK having the second biggest economy in the EU.Scotland is a land of massive natural resources. We have a erse economy. We have a highly educated workforce. What we don#t have is the power to direct these assets in the way that aligns with Scottish values. Our economy has exceptional resources to support better pensions.The Scottish Government has guaranteed to continue to pay every state pension. Occupational and personal pension rights will stay the sameScotland becomes independent. We have accrued these benefits and are legally entitled to them.Maureen Beaton, LochgilpheadSir,I am suffering from Ecological Anxiety Syndrome.The symptoms are mixed but are characterised by night-sweats, unexpected bouts of crying over tree stumps and an unwholesome desire to grab some people by the shoulders and shake them repeatedly whilst shouting #Can#t you see what you#re doing!# # until they ask me to stop.I have been to the doctor and he tells me it is just a symptom of my ardent belief that we are killing the planet. He#s put me on a course of pills called #Idongivadam#. ApparentlyI take three a day, with meals, I will be over the worst within a few weeks and be able to integrate back into a society whose bodies naturally manufacture this wonder-drug.Seriously, though, how much do we care about the destruction of our environment  Because every day I read or hear about some new type of poison we have thrown in extravagant quantities into our lochs or see waterfalls of newly-fallen rain washing out of our increasingly bare hillsides or listen to more news about valuable peat being dug up so we can grow a few flowers.Should we care  After all, our lespans are finite and in a few decades it won#t be our problem any more.No it won#t # it will be our children left holding back the tide. Unfortunately, by then, the tide may overwhelm them so completely that there will be no coming back. A drowned world is no world at all.On second thoughts I have decided not to take the pills after all # just live with the symptoms. After all, I would rather care about the planet, and Scotland#s future, than do nothing.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,Following the debate in parliament on Monday October , Blue Cross is incredibly disappointed that the UK Government has not committed to change current legislation to make pet theft a crime in its own right.We feel this is a huge missed opportunity to protect the lives of pets and reassure their owners that pet theft is taken as a very serious crime. Pets are not simply #property#, they are sentient beings and much loved family members.Our pet bereavement support service has been supporting owners for over  years and we know only too well the devastation, stress and anxiety caused by the theft of a beloved pet which deserves to be recognised and thieves punished accordingly.We are however, encouraged that the government has stated its willingness to engage in further discussion on the sentencing guidelines and we look forward to being fully involved.Becky Thwaites, head of public affairs, Blue CrossSir,I was out and about in Port Charlotte recently speaking to my constituents and hearing about many pressing local concerns while social distancing.It was great to check up on the progress of the local pavement and road repairs in the village.

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures october 30 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis autumnal scene of Dun na Cuaiche hill and tower was captured by Inveraray reader Donald John MacDonald earlier this month."},{"url":null,"title":"combating covid but at what cost","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWill the impact of the coronavirus pandemic have a lasting impact beyond the immediate concerns of public health and the economy Our regular artistic contributor Ann Thomas of Tarbert muses on the possible loss of old traditions as a result of the pandemic.

We know that our early ancestors split from chimpanzees, our closest ape relative, around - million years ago , and that the first near-humans of our genusevolved in Africa at least . Myr.These forerunners eventually gave rise to us , but our knowledge of what happened between these dates is very limited, largely because fossilised remains are extremely rare.Common illustrations depicting how our upright posture, facial features and lack of body hair gradually evolved are based on few skeletons of ancient ancestors. Most notable is that of Lucy, a young female skeleton dating back to . Myr.Lucy was discovered in the Afar depression, Ethiopia, in , and was assigned to a species more primitive than ours , and named A. afarensis after her location. In the s a few teeth and bone fragments were found that proved to be similar to, but even older than, Lucy, dating from ^ Myr and called A. anamensis. it was assumed that Lucy was directly descended from this ancient primate.Not surprisingly, there was much excitement in the field when anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered a near-complete skull of A. anamensis dating from approximately .

As the oldest and most-complete skull of A. anamensis, this find allowed detailed comparison with Lucy’s species.There was general agreement that, like the illustration, our ancient ancestors descended one from another in a linear fashion. So most experts assumed that A. anamensis evolved directly into Lucy’s species.Haile-Selassie’s detailed study of MRD suggests, however, that the two species co-existed in Africa for at least , years, presumably with the potential for interbreeding. This undoubtedly shakes up previous thoughts and reshapes our understanding of Homo evolution.But only time will tell Haile-Salassie says he hopes to find the rest of MRD’s skeleton # and even earlier members of our Homo genus # which should certainly help unravel our deep past."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsBob has only gone and done it!

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsHistorian and writer Robin Campbell is set to give an illustrated online talk next week on a subject of great interest to Argyll and the isles.On Friday November  he will make a presentation to the Gaelic Society of Inverness about nineteenth century West Highland Argyllshire bard, John Macdougallfrom Ardgour in Morvern and a rare Gaelic poem by this much-neglected cultural figure.The poem is in praise of estate factor John Campbell from Islay, who served as Chamberlain to the th and th Dukes of Argyll from .

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself.

It was one of the reasons the band stopped playing.Mr Temple later went on to front the Hawick-based band Lordy in the s.Before the book was finished, Mr Temple, who was a journalist for  years before retiring in , invited people to purchase it to fund the design and production costs, which he describes as a ldquotremendous success.Like many businesses across the nation, Mr Templersquos music agency took a hit when lockdown was announced, with live performances cancelled leading to planned tours being scrapped.However, Mr Temple says he has ldquoreally enjoyed dipping back into his time in bands in the Borders.ldquoEveryone likes to look back on their happy memories and I have more than my fair share of those, he said.ldquoRight now, people are more nostalgic than ever and looking to happier times for a temporary escape, and hopefully some light relief from whatrsquos happening in the world.The Music Goes lsquoRound and lsquoRound, priced at pound., will be on sale in Borders bookshops from Saturday, November  and online via the beenandgoneanddoneit website."},{"url":null,"title":"h-r-gray-haulage-create-modern-drive-delivery-centre-meet-delivery-demand","story":"HR Gray Haulage to create a modern drive through delivery centre to meet delivery demand through the COVID pandemic.The company was started in  by Robin Gray.

Often, smaller chips can be repaired with spot repairs, which work by injecting the chip with resin. Its a good way of preventing any further damage. Larger cracks usually mean that the screen will need to be replaced.. THE WIPERSIn combination with the washers, the wipers are a frontline defence when driving on the roads in winter so give them a good check. Are they rubbing or squeaking in use, or do they appear cracked and dry under close inspection  If they are, then its a good idea to swap them out for new ones. This is usually a pretty simple task and can be done at home, though many retailers will be able to fit them for you, should you prefer.. THE TYRESAs the main point of contact between car and road, tyres are a crucial part of a cars operation. When the weather turns wetter, tyres are even more important too, so now is the best time to give them a once-over.Check the sidewalls for any cracks or dry patches, and ensure theres enough tread too. The UK legal limit for tread depth is .mm, and you can check this by using a p piece: slot the coin into one of the grooves andthe outer band is obscured, the tyres are legal. If its visible, then the tyres need changing.Check the pressures too. They can be found in the owners manual, inside the drivers door or behind the fuel filler cap. Find out the right pressure and adjust your tyres accordingly, using either a home compressor or one at a garage or fuel station.. THE LIGHTSDuring winter, were all spending more time on the roads at night, which is why ensuring your lights are working correctly is essential. Try your headlamps and main beams when parked ndash drive close to a wall or reflective surface and youll be able to see. If a bulb is out, then its paramount that you get it replaced.Then check your rear lights and brake lights. You can do this either by asking a friend to look while you use the brake pedal, or reverse close to a shiny surfaceand try the brakes. Look in your rear-view mirror and you should be able to seetheyre working correctly. Do the same for your reversing light too. This is also a good time to try your indicators and hazards too. Try the horn, too."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-build-new-playpark-peebles-approved","story":"PLANS have been approved to build a new playpark in Peebles.The facility will be erected in Victoria Park

If you delay, charges and interest could be applied to that debt and it could snowball and become a much bigger problem.Evenyou donrsquot personally find yourself in debt, it is important not to blame those who do. Sharon points out that while society often assumes that people in financial dficulty have been lsquorecklessrsquo with their money, most have simply been impacted by le events that are outwith their control.ldquoOne of the things that is particularly evident now with Covid is making people more conscious of the fact that money is dficult, and they are more willing to speak about debt.

Working animals play a key role in the world’s poorest communities and help provide a livelihood for more than half a billion people.An estimated  million working horses, donkeys, camels and elephants are relied upon to transport goods, food, water and firewood. By doing the jobs of trucks, tractors and taxis, this invisible workforce ensures the survival of poverty-stricken families.However, these animals often endure appalling conditions, with poor nutrition and no access to veterinary treatment when they are sick or injured.At the animal charity the Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad , we believe that working animals overseas should receive the respect, compassion and vital veterinary care they desperately need.On International Working Animal Day , please find out how you can show your support for these hardworking animals by visiting www.spana.org iwad.Geoffrey Dennis, chief executive, SPANA.This week marks Occupational Therapy Weekand I want to personally thank these unsung heroes who make a dference to so many lives.As someone living with a terminal illness, I am a day patient at the Marie Curie Edinburgh hospice and I never imagined occupational therapists would play a vital role in my le.Whether it has been attending relevant classes to ease conditions, such as fatigue, anxiety and breathlessness, to discovering what allowances I was entitled to and taking part in the ious day therapy sessions on offer, they have also made sure I can continue living independently at home too.Their constant support and advice has kept me safe in these unprecedented times and without occupational therapists, my le – like so many others – would be very dferent to what it is today.Thank you.Helen Hogg, Midlothian."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week november 6 2020","story":"I have just watched the most amazing programme I think I have ever seen and one which will stay in my memory forever.John Bishop was involved in the rehabilitation of Little White and Little Grey from captivity to freedom.This took the most amazing time of eight years of meticulous planning with vets, scientists, experts in the study of cetaceans, and technical geniuses.It is the wonderful story of Little White and Little Grey.

Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

to Haddington two years ago, has published The Fossil Woman, a biography of the ldquomost famous person many of us had never heard of ndash fossilist Mary Anning ndash drawing on his own expertise and love of the subject.Mary Anning was born in Lyme Regis, Dorset, in , the daughter of a cabinet maker.Her father supplemented his meagre income by selling fossils found on the Lyme Regis coast to tourists, and taught his children to do the same.He died when Mary was aged  but she and her older brother Joseph continued to find, clean and sell the fossils.But Mary went further, studying her finds and learning about geology and palaeontology, at a time when such sciences were still in their infancy.Tom said: ldquoShe was quite exceptional.ldquoShe wasnrsquot the only woman collecting fossils at the time but almost all the other women who were involved in palaeontology in some way were middle class, or upper class or gentry they were amateurs, or many of them were married to geologists.ldquoBut Mary was poor, working class and she was selling fossils.ldquoSo she was arguably one of the first professional geologists in the world.Tom told the Courier: ldquoPeople were coming to Lyme Regis to see her, to learn from her, to buy specimens for museums and universities and for their own private collections.Tom, originally from Rutherglen, studied geology at the University of Glasgow before moving to Wales and becoming the curator of palaeontology at National Museum Wales.He has taught geology at the Universities of Cardf and Bristol and has worked in expedition travel since , travelling mainly in the Arctic, Antarctic, North Atlantic and Patagonia.He was approached to write the biography of Mary Anning by The Dovecote Press publishing company, which wanted to set the record straight ahead of a biopic of the geologist, called Ammonite and starring Kate Winslet, which is due for a big screen release next year.The film, directed by Francis Lee, alludes to a love affair between Mary and Charlotte Murchison ndash which Tom said is unlikely to have happened.ldquoCharlotte Murchison is portrayed as being a young woman suffering from melancholy, Tom said, ldquoand actually Charlotte was  years older than Mary Anning.ldquoAnd then therersquos an odd reference in a letter from Mary to Charlotte as to how attractive she finds [Charlottersquos] husband.ldquoMaryrsquos talking about reports she had heard about Murchison giving a lecture somewhere, and how great it was, and this Mary could believe, lsquobecause hersquos the handsomest piece of flesh and blood I ever saw!rsquoWhatever the fiction built up around Mary Anning, Tom believes she was one of the most signicant women in the history of Britain.He said: ldquoShe certainly hasnrsquot had the recognition that she deserves.ldquoI mean, she should be up there with the great women of the th century: people like Florence Nightingale and Jane Austen.And as for that

classtruncate-full-screengtave been suddenly thrown into a world ofWide-ranging restrictions on all our lives have led to a wave of redundancies and financial uncertainty, with the unfortunate likelihood that there will be many more job losses over the months to come.This economic catastrophe means that many people, even those who have never previously had money worries, might find themselves in a position where they fall into debt while trying to make ends meet. But while the situation sounds bleak, the good news is that there is plenty of support out there for anyone who needs it.Debt charity StepChange has been delivering free debt advce in Scotland since , with a team of sympathetic and knowledgeable advisors ready to help those who are in financial trouble. ldquoI think itrsquos very important for people to understand that they are not alone, stresses Sharon Bell, Head of StepChange Scotland.ldquoWe all take out credit at dferent times in our lives, whether it is to buy a new car, a house, to purchase something. In normal situations you will make your payments and pay back that credit ndash but your circumstances can change over time.ldquoWhether it is because you have had a cut in your working hours, or yoursquove lost your job, or suddenly your costs have increased and money is more dficult to manage. Irrespective of your type of debt we would look at all your debt and your income and expenditure and look at what options are out there that are available for you.ldquoWe will help you understand what your options are.ldquoYou could be in arrears on your rent or behind on your electric bill but what we will do is look at the dferent types of debt you have and whether you can manage that debt better, orit has to be looked at as a potential write-off.You might be reading this while thinking you would never let yourself fall into debt, presuming it is something that only happens to other people. But according to Sharon, debt is a very subjective issue.ldquoSomebody can owe a family member pound, and that could be really important to them. They could be really worried, and really stressing, about the fact they are in debt for pound.ldquoThere are other people who could have loans or credit card bills that constitute multiple thousands of pounds ndash butthey are able to manage these payments then debt isnrsquot a problem.ldquoThe problems start coming when you are not able to make your repayments, and you start to feel stressed. If you are feeling stressed about the money you owe, you have what we would call lsquoproblem debtrsquo and you should get help and advice as quickly as possible.ldquoThe sooner you get help and advice, the quicker and easier it will be to deal with that debt. If you delay, charges and interest could be applied to that debt and it could snowball and become a much bigger problem.Evenyou donrsquot personally find yourself in debt, it is important not to blame those who do. Sharon points out that while society often assumes that people in financial dficulty have been lsquorecklessrsquo with their money, most have simply been impacted by le events that are outwith their control.ldquoOne of the things that is particularly evident now with Covid is making people more conscious of the fact that money is dficult, and they are more willing to speak about debt. And I donrsquot think anybody should be scared to speak about debt with loved ones, friends, or with an organisation like StepChange.ldquoWe are here to help, not to make judgements, only to help you deal with your circumstances. Most people have had debt, or some financial dficulty, at some point in their lives.Sharon has a team of  trained money advisors working in the StepChange Glasgow office. Theyrsquove even introduced a dedicated Covid payment plan, a short-term solution to help those whose financial situation has been negatively affected by the coronavirus pandemic.Itrsquos designed for those who perhaps werenrsquot in financial dficulty before March, but as a direct influence of Covid they find themselves in a dficult spot. It is designed to help people through and give them breathing space, according to Sharon. ldquoThe pandemic has caused some who struggle to struggle even more, whereas for others they have been thrown into the world of debt that they never thought they would be in.And Irsquom sure it will be a very distressing time, with uncertainty about jobs and outgoings, it causes a lot of stress. ldquoYoursquove got a pandemic which is impacting on peoplersquos health and wellbeing, when you add financial stress into that peoplersquos wellbeing can get even worse.Fortunately, whatever your circumstances, the team at StepChange are on hand to offer free, non-judgemental advice to anyone in need.Get online advice now at www. stepchange.org scotland or call    "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-travel-restrictions-scotland-force-today","story":"After the new coronavirus rules were branded nonsensical and many Scots were left feeling confused, The Scottish Government published guidance which outlined howthose living in a tier  or  council area ldquoare now required to stay in that area unless they have a reasonable excuse to travel.:Rules branded nonsensical as Scots banned from airports but not flights abroadThose who are caught violating the new rules, could face a pound fine, which rises topoundnot paid within  days.Here is everything you need to know about the latest travel restrictions coming into force from this evening.In a list published by the Scottish Government, reasonssuch as travelling to and from work unable to work from home, travelling for education, and \"essential shopping\" are cited as \"reasonable\".:Travel ban exemptions published amid legal questionsThese include the following:Travel restrictions are now enforceable by law - which means the police can distribute pound fines to those caught breaching the rules.This amount can increase to poundnot paid within  days, and repeat offenders could face penalties of up to pound.:Police to enforce travel ban in tier  and  areasHowever, Police Scotland has stated that there will be no road blocks orroutine stops of vehicles, and has asked that people continue to but asked people to ldquotake personal responsibility over the new restrictions.Public transport will continue to run as normal, with face mask and social distancing rules observed when travelling.However, people in restricted areas have again been asked to limit their journeys and should only use public transport\"essential.\"The Scottish Government has also stated that motorists should avoid carsharing with anyone who is not in their own household.For people living in tier one or tier two areas, it is a requirement to avoid travelling to level three or four restrictions.That said, travel to other tier one and tier two areas can continue, as long as the other guidelines are followed.However,you live in a tier three or four area, it is now a legal requirement to remain within your own council area - unless you have one of the \"reasonable excuses\" listed above.Those living in tier four must also be mindful of keeping journeys to an absolute minimum.Holidays are considered non-essential, and therefore those living in tier three or four areas should not go on holiday.:Nicola Sturgeon confirms dying mum can go on final holidayPeople living in tier one and two have also been strongly advised not to travel abroad, unless it is essential - however it is still legal for them to go on holiday and travel to airports or other travel stations.There are still -day quarantine periods in place for travellers arriving into Scotland from thecountries apart from those on the Scottish Governments exempt list."},{"url":null,"title":"fitness-classes-return-east-lothian-sports-centres-tuesday","story":"Enjoyleisure, whichoperates six sports centreson behalf ofEast LothianCouncil, has today announced that its fitness classes are resumingfrom Tuesday.The classes - held in Haddington, North Berwick, Musselburgh, Dunbar, Tranent and at Meadowmill - had to be taken online last month and delivered via Zoomafter group indoor exercise activities were banned due to the pandemic.But East Lothians pending switch to a lower Covid protection level has resulted in theof a iety of activities including metafit, spinfit, zumba, yoga, aquafit, pilates and teen gym.A spokesperson for Enjoyleisure said: \"With the confirmed change in protection level in East Lothian from level  to level , we are delighted to be bringing back fitness classes to our sports centres from Tuesday, November .

Our host told us he has previously worked in Londons Savoy hotel and explained that the quality of the food can often be superior in hotels in Scotland because London hotels tend to use more pre-prepped food rather than cooking from scratch.Everything was perfect, from the portion size to the flavours and the expertly chosen wine pairings.My prawns were generously proportioned and melted in the mouth and were delicately flavoured with lime, the vegetable moussaka was richly flavoured and the raspberry eclair was light and tart.Perhaps a point or two off for breakfast as while the meaty options were plentul, there were no vegetarian sausages, the toast bread could have been nicer and pancakes were a little lacklustre for a five-star menu.Seats and tables were well spaced and there were plenty of hand sanitising stations.DRINK IN THE SIGHTSThe hotel borders the notorious th road hole and our room includes a view to the West Sands beach, made famous in the film Chariots of Fire. Theres enough time before dinner for a gentle stroll along the high street and we passed the cafe \"where Kate Middleton had coffee with Prince William\".NICE TOUCHThe hotel has made every effort to help ensure guests feel Covid safe, from the remote controls deposited in a closed paper bag to a seal on the door to ensure staff cant re-enter the room and the bed turn-down service is optional. I enjoyed a heavenly -minute relaxing massage in the spaand feel the stresses of the previous few months melt away.Despite visiting with a family member who had been shielding, and feeling slightly nervous about a first trip away from home, we felt extremely safe and you cant put a price on that.ABOUT THE AREAThere is plenty to see in the historic seaside town, from Scotlands first university to the beaches and the ruins of St Andrews Castle, with its medieval bottle dungeon.The next day we took a walk along the Fe Coastal Path, which runs from Kincardine to Newburgh, before enjoying an ice-cream at Jannettas Gelateria which has been a fixture in the town for  years and was worth the student queues.Old Station Rd, St Andrews, KY SP,  , www.oldcoursehotel"},{"url":null,"title":"film-zeina-durras-luxor-tells-tale-doctor-recovering-ptsd-egyptian-city","story":"Her directorial debut, The Imperialists Are Still Alive! - whose name was borrowed from Jean-Luc Godards La Chinoise - first premiered at Sundance Film Festival in  and explored New Yorks vibrant Middle Eastern bohemian subculture.Now, nearly a decade on, the filmmakers latest project, Luxor, finds itself born into the chaotic landscape of , once again centred around the familiarity of Middle Eastern culture.\"My dad is Arab, my mum was born over there, so I definitely understand the sensibility - the Pan-Arab sensibility,\" remarks Durra, .\"Which gave me access but also I could direct in my Arabic, which was interesting.\"As the name would suggest, the film-makers latest creative endeavour is set in the southern Egyptian city of Luxor.Its meandering storyline follows an English surgeon named Hana, played by Andrea Riseborough, as she attempts to overcome post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of recent aid work in war-torn Syria.While recovering, she comes face-to-face with an ex-romantic partner, Sultan, played by actor Karim Saleh.\"This was quite dferent to my other work,\" admits Durra. \"My other work is very hard to explain to people because its so multi-layered and theres so much humour, but you can only see the humour once you know what kind of director I am.\"With this, though, I think being down is very universal being weighed down by emotion and trying to work out where youve come from, who you are, and what youre doing.\"Its not an easy topic to execute but ... its quite a universal experience and, as a result, I think this film was the easiest film Ive ever made - as in putting it together, not on set, because it was eighteen days, with a baby, all our kids, in north Africa.\"Partly a tale of rekindled interpersonal relationships, partly a reflective journey looking at the countless \"what could have been\" that punctuate le, Luxor is a film whose plot is emphasised by the grand historical surroundings of the city in which it is set.\"I was really down about a project that didnt get financed and Id been working on it for a really long time,\" recounts Durra.\"I went to bed that night, having really thought about - you know when you get bad news and youre like well, how did that happen  What were the decisions I made to get there \"And I had this vision of this woman walking through Luxor and she had this heaviness to her.\"I woke up and was telling a friend of mine about the dream and said well, do you know what, maybe this is the film \"Armed with a concept, next to no resources and the desire to shoot the film in spite of ongoing unrest, Durra set out in search of potential locations.\"It was amazing - I had two days off in the whole thing. I was out there for a bit longer I think prep was only three weeks - two weeks in Luxor.\"I was snooping in the hotel - my first time back there since I was about, I think I was twelve or thirteen.\"And I went through the service entrance, so I somehow found myself in the service area pretending to be lost and they were guiding me to the garden.\"As is often the case, creativity can spawn from the most unlikely of places.It was successive chance encounters with fellow guests that sparked Durras imagination, recruiting hotel workers and guests alike as part of the low-budget filmmaking process.\"It was just really funny, because [improvisation] was very much the way we did the movie. Theres people there and you say hey, will you come and be in the movie  Well pay you a little bit.\"There was no one in the hotel except for these old couples who were like weve been coming for forty years!\"This couple were in the service area and they were literally out of a film. They were part of an archaeology group from up north, enthusiasts, and he was in khaki with a walking cane and she was this old lady.\"So, all these tiny experiences like that really informed the film.\"That being said, its often hard to recreate those fleeting moments of inspiration after the fact, as Durra can attest.\"When youve been given this gt for your scripts and then you dont have the budget to fly in people, you look in Cairo for people but theyre not the same.\"You find ex-pats that have been living on the banks of the Nile and they dont have that were from a local archaeological society up north and were enthusiasts and weve been coming here for forty years [feeling], they have, hey, Im an ex-pat and Im tanned and I love this place.\"So, we went in, the place wasnt locked down - it was a live set, there were hotel guests walking around - and we just asked them not to look in the camera.\"Luxors release comes at a time when both the film industry and cinemas alike find themselves trapped in a stop-start cycle as a result of Covid- restrictions - something that saw the project ert from a traditional cinema-based release to an online-only launch.However, Durra notes that despite pandemic restrictions, US politics also has a part to play when it comes to the forces presently impacting the global filmmaking community.\"I have to say, I didnt realise how much tension I was holding in my body for the last four years until the result,\" she exclaims.\"I lived in America for almost twelve years and my husbands from Texas ... also, the politics there really affect where my parents live - the Middle East.\"Its going to be very interesting, because a lot of my New York friends - thats where I became a film-maker essentially because I went to NYU grad film - everyone has said God, New York might be really interesting like it was when we first went there.\"We were all there [during the] late nineties, early noughties, and that was a really interesting time...\"So, people are thinking maybe with the pandemic and now with the fact [Trump] is no longer there - with Biden Harris coming in - it might actually be a really interesting time to be back there.\"It might be an interesting time everywhere for people to do more underground things.\"Luxor is available now via virtual streamings listed on modernfilms"},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-investing-entrepreneurs-global-pandemic","story":"Thankfully, I found that the sales world was the right one for me, and it gave me both the training I needed to become an entrepreneur myself and eventually the skills I needed to be able to coach others at the beginning of their own entrepreneurial journeys.Being an entrepreneur is often seen as someone who takes a risk, has lsquoone idearsquo and then reaps the benefits. And although itrsquos true, taking risks and having a great idea are important, true entrepreneurism is all about self-development, adapting and adding massive value to your customers.However, with the threat of a potentially le-threatening virus infection looming, worry for loved ones, and the instability of the economy hanging overhead, these are most certainly dficult times.This is especially true right now, as we see business across the globe pivot and change in order to stay relevant or offer a service that hasnrsquot been thought of before.For businesspeople, it can feel asthe right move at this point in time is to stop taking risks and shore up investments to protect the assets you have. Well, Irsquom here to say that although these times are uncertain, now is the time to invest in entrepreneurs you believe in and disrupt the status quo.Having invested more than pound, in  to date, I certainly am not sitting on the sidelines on this issue. I have discovered entrepreneurs in the field of sport, IT and sales and have invested the money they needed to get their businesses off the ground. But the all-important factor here is investing time and effort into mentoring ambitious people, not their ideas.I strongly believe that there is not enough education about entrepreneurism. One clear common misconception about starting up a business or becoming an entrepreneur is that you need a lot of money and finding funds is important in order to get started. However, I believe sourcing grants and funds can give business start-ups a  sense of security and that possibility of failure is a key driving force in making a business successful.Up until five years ago, I was battling my way to the top. I started my business with just a credit card and the thought of failure meant not just letting down the people I had employed, but also my family. Now that Irsquove built a successful career that I truly love, I want to give back by being there for young entrepreneurs who are hungry for success, who are positive, resilient, adaptable, curious and incredibly hard working.My ultimate goal is to help create seven inidual millionaires in my letime. Since the start of the year, and the start of the COVID- pandemic, Irsquove growing closer and closer to helping one person achieve this goal.Although these times are certainly frightening, some of the best businesses are born in ambiguity. Limits on time and changes in demand push people to get creative with their ideas and thatrsquos why now is the time to invest in entrepreneurs who have the drive, work ethic and creativity to make the world move forward.Gilles Baudet is founder and managing director of lrmThe Interactive Team"},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-opinion-nicola-sturgeon-backing-goliath-not-david","story":"Irsquom talking here about businesses like Viola Vintage, a beautul antique and curio shop on Paisley Road West in Glasgow. The shop specialises in vintage objects as well as gts such as candles, frames and the like, and itrsquos one of the many small firms that have been moving into the area. I spoke to Susan, the owner, not long after the lockdown was announced, and her reaction was simple. Shersquos gutted, but she also believes the restrictions are unfair. For years now, therersquos been a David and Goliath struggle on the high street, and for some reason the Scottish Government has backed Goliath.The sense of unfairness that Susan and others feel is based on a central iniquity: firms like Viola Vintage are being forced to close while big businesses like Tesco ndash therersquos a branch just along the road from Susanrsquos shop ndash are not. What that means is the big guys can continue to sell gts ndash candles, cards, etc ndash that people might have bought from smaller shops. In other words, Goliath continues to make profits while David suffers. As Susan says: itrsquos unfair.Sadly, we saw the same kind of thing a few months ago when the first closedown happened. I spoke to the McIndoe family, who own the Mill Garden Centre in Armadale, and their frustration was that firms like theirs were forcibly closed while BQ and the supermarkets were allowed to stay open and sell plants and compost. Adam McGowan, of McLarenrsquos Nurseries near Barrhead, told me a similar story. Their profits plummeted, thousands of plants were dumped, and the emotional and financial toll on the staff was huge. He used the same word as Susan: it was, he said, gutting.And the worst of it is that itrsquos completely unnecessary. Even back in the spring, there was no good argument for closing shops like McLarenrsquos while allowing the big guys like BQ to stay open. Garden centres usually have plenty of space and they introduced safety measures. And several months on, the argument is even less convincing. Small businesses have adapted and followed the rules and, as David Lonsdale of the Scottish Retail Consortium says, there is little evidence that closing shops does much to suppress the spread of the virus.The Scottish Governmentrsquos response has been that therersquos a new package of support for small businesses that are going to be affected. But there are a number of problems with the help thatrsquos on offer. First, it falls short of the income that the businesses might have made had they been allowed to stay open.Second, itrsquos not clear how much support there will be for firms that are indirectly hit. The bakers that supply restaurants for example. Or the small manufacturers ndash jewellers and the like ndash that supply shops such as Susanrsquos.And thirdly, and most importantly, providing financial support to small businesses during an enforced close-down is looking at the problem the wrong way round. From the start of this crisis, government has encouraged firms to claim financial support rather than supporting them to operate safely and the Scottish Government is still doing it. What that does is pile economic pain on economic pain rather than allowing businesses to make their own money.Which leaves it up to us, I suppose: the Davids in this struggle will have to be helped by other Davids. We can all check, for example,the small businesses forced to close have websites and shop there. We can buy vouchers as gts so that the businesses continue to have some income during the closure. And when the shops reopen, we can make a conscious decision to use firms in our community rather than the big chains that continue to rake it in during the quarantine.But, even with all of that, itrsquos going to be grim for a lot of small businesses and what makes it worse is theyrsquove been punished for doing the right thing. As the Scottish Retail Consortium says, shops have taken every step possible to keep their customers and staff safe. And yet still they are being forced to close. Itrsquos disastrous. Itrsquos unfair. In the words of Mr Lonsdale, itrsquos going to be a bitter winter. And for thousands of small businesses that are going to lose millions of pounds, it is absolutely gutting.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

My favourite and most memorable Christmases were spent in Fe with my parents-in-law, fierce atheists who nonetheless enjoyed the traditional coming together of close family at Christmas.As they became older the stress of cooking a full traditional Christmas dinner became too much, so I would marinate a leg of lamb in Asian spices, cook up a couple of curries and loads of pilau rice, and raita , load everything into the car with kids and husband and drive to Dunfermline.

Mr Carmichael and Ms Wishart are now asking the energy regulator to tackle what they describe as “energy increases over and above the rate of inflation, staggering billing issues and appalling levels of misinformation.”The letter highlights some examples:An elderly couple received a bill in July  stating they owed £ for the period April to July. For comparison, the bill for the same period in  was £ – despite only using a single radiator in their home for heating.A constituent’s meter readings were mis-entered into a supplier billing system by a representative, thereby creating a huge yet erroneous bill for nearly £,.A constituent received a letter stating their direct debit would increase fivefold, with only two weeks’ notice. They constituent could not afford such an increase and the company later admitted that the letter was sent out automatically, despite there being a vulnerability marker on the constituent’s account. Mr Carmichael and Ms Wishart wrote: “These huge increases have very real consequences for our constituents. We have received reports of people switching off their hot water heaters completely, turning down their storage heaters, making do with one storage heater to heat an entire house, and relying on hot water bottles and blankets. One constituent even told us they had to turn off the heating completely during the summer to save money.”Commenting Mr Carmichael said: “Feeling overcharged for electricity and heating is all too familiar to people in the isles but even by those standards the stories we have received from constituents this year are outrageous. It is small wonder we are still facing down the scourge of fuel poverty when energy providers are acting in this manner.“We will be putting the case to Ofgem that island communities cannot be treated in the same way as any other part of the UK. Geographical challenges and lack of competition make it harder for islanders to get a fair deal – and that is where the regulator must play its part.”Ms Wishart said: “The stories we’ve heard from constituents are appalling. Billing errors and misinformation from providers is unacceptable and causing real worry, especially for vulnerable customers. Poor service and price hikes are on top of fuel poverty that is already a real concern serious issue in the isles and that must be addressed. While we’ve engaged directly with the companies at fault it is very clear that there are wider issues Ofgem needs to step in and tackle. “Please do continue to get in touchyou would like to share your story or would like help and advice in raising issues with your provider.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The intergenerational project ‘Kelp Store – Restore the Shore’ will engage the local community in coastal protection, restore and create local heritage assets and upskill a new generation of volunteer stone workers to ensure that valuable local knowledge is passed on.As part of the project, a m stretch of a cassie sea defence will be rebuilt, a new dry-stone kelp dyke will be built and a manual providing guidance to other Scottish islands and coastal communities will be developed.The Friends of St Ninian’s has also been awarded £, for a project to engage local volunteers to produce a GIS resourceto collate archive material about Newark Bay cemetery and chapel into one . This includes a geophysical survey that will be available to the community, researchers and the public.Anne Mitchell, director and treasurer of the Friends of St Ninian’s, said: “The Friends of St Ninian#s, Deerness, Orkney are very pleased to be recipients of an HES Coasts and Waters Heritage Fund grant which will allow us to create a Geographical Information System for the site at Newark. Newark encompasses complex archaeology stretching from the Bronze Age to the early th Century, all in danger of being lost as a result of increased climatic storminess. It includes the remains of the people buried in the cemetery there in the period c. AD to AD who may yet tell us much about the Pictish Viking transition in Orkney and its impact on Scotland and further afield. The GIS project will complement work already being undertaken with HES funding on previously excavated material from Newark by Orkney Research Centre for Archaeology, who will also play a large part in the setting up of the Newark GIS in this further community-based project.”Jonathan Ford, Papay Ranger, said: “Our Kelp Store # Restore The Shore Project seeks to protect and enhance a historically important section of Papay’s island coastline, while instilling islanders with the practical knowledge of traditional skills which will help the community safeguard the future island coastline in the face of rising seas and increasing erosion of the land.”The Coasts and Waters Heritage Fund is a one-off competitive fund which launched in March to celebrate Scotland’s themed year.Amy Eastwood, head of grants at HES, said: “We are pleased to support these  projects as part of our Coasts and Waters Heritage Fund. This funding will support a wide range of community outreach activities as well as crucial repairs to historic maritime structures which not only encourages people to engage with our coastal and waterway heritage but helps to ensure it is protected for future generations.“From Dumfries and Galloway to the Highlands and Islands, these projects cover a wide geographical spread and showcase the fantastic work that goes on within communities across the country to harness, highlight and help to place a spotlight on Scotland’s erse coastal heritage.”Alex Paterson, chief executive of HES, said: “The Coasts and Waters Heritage Fund was launched to empower communities to protect, promote and engage with Scotland’s coastal and waterway heritage as well as adapting to the effects of current challenges such as climate change. What the range of projects have shown is that our coastal heritage is a fabric that runs through communities, both in terms of sense of place but also how it has shaped people’s lives as well as how coastal communities are continuing to adapt to the effects of current challenges such as climate change.

STP has recently highlighted the efforts of folk from across the nation who have helped keep the heart in their communities by supporting industry.Starlings, Wellpark Garden Centre, Sutherlands Pharmacy, Argo#s Bakery and William Shearer have also been recognised for the work they have done to keep the community safe as they shop.Kirkwall BID, which temporarily rebranded as BID and Beyond during the early stages of lockdown, has been working hard to promote Orkney’s business community at this challenging time. Through campaigns such as Keep the Heart in Kirkwall, and Mile of Style, as well as lobbying for businesses in need of funding, the BID has had a visible presence throughout the pandemic. The #beyond# funding was recently renewed, allowing the team to spread their efforts across Orkney, this winter. Mrs Bruce who works for the BID as a consultant, was delighted to receive the accolade, alongside Mr McLean, the organisation’s chairman.She said: #Since Kirkwall BID started in , we feel it’s helped bring lots of buzz and business back to our town centre.“Mostly we’ve focused on creating exciting events and fun promotions. We never imagined we’d have to help our members cope with something as serious as a pandemic.“When the virus first hit, we realised it was going to have an enormous impact on Kirkwall, not least because a whole eco-system of businesses depends on tourism — and that disappeared overnight.“BID has done its very best to help, and we#re proud to have our efforts recognised in this way.#Mr McLean added: “We’re delighted to receive this award.“I#d like to thank all the BID board, and especially our part-time but fully-enthusiastic staff, Laura Bruce, Melanie Miller, our current manager, and Kelly Kirkness, our previous manager.“The way I see it, every business in Kirkwall is a High Street Hero. They’ve had to battle a totally unexpected catastrophe to keep their businesses afloat.“All have worked hard, and many have reinvented what they do in imaginative ways that serve the changing needs of our community.“BID have been cheerleaders for our town, and it’s great to have someone giving us a cheer with this award!”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The butter was churned for just the rightof time to give a taste and flavour no other butter could match. We use the same recipe today with natural, unrefined Isle of Skye sea salt for an extra special taste experience. Ideal for cooking or spreading on a freshly baked loaf of bread.”Chris and Meena Watts, directors of the Dunvegan-based Isle of Skye Sea Salt Co, said: “We are thrilled to work with the Graham’s family and Scotland’s number one Scottish food brand to produce Graham’s Scottish Butter with Isle of Skye Sea Salt. Our pure eco-friendly sea salt resonates so well with the natural beauty of Skye as a brand.“Our many awards reinforce the fact that adopting an eco-friendly ethos across all our activities – from loch to larder – has allowed us to produce a top-quality Scottish product loved by chefs and food lovers across the country. We are very excited that Graham’s latest butter now includes our sea salt. We are proud to be part of the Scottish food and drink industry and feel that Grandma Isabella would approve of this match.“We have always promoted the Isle of Skye ‘brand’ and recognise how important this is for all the small businesses here who work so hard, especially in these challenging times, to keep things together. So, we are particularly pleased that Graham’s Isle of Skye sea salt butter will transport our ‘brand’ throughout Scotland. We would like to thank everyone who has supported us along the way.”Graham’s Isle of Skye Sea Salt Butter is now available in Spar shops across Scotland, and will be in Tesco stores from th October, with the aim of rolling the product out across the rest of the UK."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/C-DICKSON-THE-SQUARE-4-scaled.jpg","title":"portree hotel boss unveils ambitious plans for somerled","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineMr Dickson has produced a model depicting a vision for the village centre which will go on public display from Thursday th at the Portree Hotel.He will also submit a planning application to Highland Council on the same day.The plans,realised, would see the village centre undergo a major change.The current car parking facilities would be transformed into a green space, with seating, which would be bordered on three sides by spaces for vehicles. that he envisaged the area as somewhere which could be utilised for open-air s while also being adaptable as indoor space through the use of a marquee.Meanwhile, the taxi rank, which was moved to the area outside the Church of Scotland earlier this year to accommodate the Portree Hotel’s greenhouse-style outside seating area, would be relocated to one of the current bus lanes.Other changes would include the installation of pre-built market stalls in the village square with provision for power, water and drainage implementation of electric charging points for vehicles outside Portree Sherf Court a bike lock-up and three pedestrian crossing points connecting the surrounding businesses to the square..Mr Dickson is spearheading a nine-member cohort called the Portree Village Improvement Group which includes staff from the Portree Hotel and the Granary plus other local businesses in the village.He said the group’s proposals come in response to a damning town centre health check report published in  by Highland Council.Within the report, the council outlined a number of concerns about the state of the village such as: a lack of greenery within the square a lack of cycling facilities problems for pedestrians moving through the town centre poor conditions of roads and pavements and a sense of conflict between traffic and pedestrians. its desire was to work in full collaboration with Highland Council, the local trust, and all community groups in the area to bring forward simple proposals and solutions to care for the village, enhancing community lestyles, visitor experiences, and further encouraging economic opportunities.Mr Dickson said the group had not yet consulted with Highland Council, the Portree and Braes Community Trust or the Portree and Braes Community Council about the plans for the major redevelopment.Portree and Braes Community Trust vice chair Ross Cowie said: “The trust welcomes the possibility of being involved in the group’s vision for the village in the future and looked forward to seeing the model and plans as soon as they were available to view.“To date, the trust had not been invited to comment.”: “Over the past decades there have been many discussions and plans to change Somerled Square, but not recently has there been an open and public discussion.“We built a model that will be on display from next week to give one suggestion of what can be done, but more importantly it was built to inspire people to discuss the many ideas that are out there.“The planning application that will be submitted next week was developed purely to force a formal discussion by the council, but more crucially to open up a formal consultation on the square’s future.“We all want change in Portree, let’s actually have a proper consultation and get it done.”Skye Express manager Iain Cumming, who is a member of the improvement group, said: “Skye is apparently the second-most visited place in Scotland, and Portree is the heart and soul of Skye, and I think the centre of that hub should be a nice place where you can relax, unwind and make nice memories.“It’s about bringing the community together. All we have is a grey concrete slab [the square] to look at, and seagulls trying to steal your chips.“We used to have street fairs, and a lot of activity going on, but the area just doesn’t allow for any community integration.“There is no warmth about the place, but this model looks absolutely fantastic.”A Highland Council spokesman said: “These proposals are being brought forward by Mr Dickson and have had no formal involvement or endorsement from the council at this stage.“The council, in partnership with other key agencies and the community, is progressing the preparation of a Skye and Raasay plan, which will identy existing and suitable future projects across the whole area including Portree, and an update will be provided to the Skye and Raasay committee on th November.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/INVERINATE-RODDY-MACLEOD-2.jpg","title":"if you are rich and powerful you can do what you like in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineRoddy and Tina MacLeod from Inverinate have been battling Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Dubaifor several years and were buoyed in June when Highland Council rejected the latest proposal for a six-bedroom lodge around  feet from their family home, ‘Corriehallie’.This week they learned that Gordon Reid, the Scottish Government’s planning appeals reporter, was minded to throw his weight behind the Sheikh’s plans, part of a series of developments taking place around the - acre Killilan and Inverinate Estate.: “We are utterly devastated. Dad is very upset and quite distraught. I am furious. Of course we expected this, but we always felt there might just be a tiny glimmer of hope for some understanding of this rural area and respect for our local planning authority.“It will be interesting to see the future implications of this decision. It essentially means that the public comments procedure in place on the planning system is rendered obsolete.” Thirty local objections to the Sheikh’s plans were submitted to the council, with none in favour. However, the insistence of council planner Graham Sharp that the application be approved – a recommendation defeated by members of the north planning committee in June – was the reason why the estate was able to appeal the matter to the Scottish Government. The council had rejected two previous applications for a lodge.Miss MacLeod added: “If you are rich and powerful, and preferably foreign non-resident, you can do what you like in Scotland.

He was then moved from Garafad to Kilmaluag and everyone there got typhoid.“That’s what made me think whether it would be similar to this outbreak.”She added: “You see that in the Skye school logs from the time of the Spanish Flu — some of the schools shut for two weeks and two weeks later they are still not open.”The logbooks trace everything from weather, tattie picking and peat cutting, as well as disease.Commenting on the information recorded on the Spanish Flu pandemic, Catherine said: “Early summer in  was the first signs of it, and then the second, which was the biggest wave, was autumn  into winter.“I have noticed from looking at the school records there’s a trend from January to March , with the schools starting to reopen in the spring, in April.”Indeed entries from the Broadford School logbook states: “January th, : Colds prevalent among children this week, attendance consequently not so good.”It adds: “January th, : Owing to the outbreak of an epidemic of influenza in the district, school closes for three weeks in the first instance on medical authority.“March th, : School did not reopen till this date.”Meanwhile, the log for the Braes school shows a similar pattern in early .“January th : No pupils turned out today on account of a serious epidemic of influenza having broken out in the district.”A copy of the certicate from the medical officer for health for the closing of the school, signed in Portree on th January , details: “On account of the prevalence of influenza in the district I hereby recommend that the Braes School be closed for a period of four weeks from the above date in the interest of public health.

Four pupils have had their names removed from the register.”The National Records of Scotland states that over five months in late  there were , registered deaths in Scotland, more than the corresponding five months of the previous year.The deaths in , by comparison, had been the lowest since .The report confirmed that at least , deaths that year were attributable to influenza.“There is a case where the education board came over and said you need to close for two to three weeks,” said Catherine, “and then you#ll see another letter stating that the school was looking at reopening before going on to stay shut for a few weeks.#She added: “When I’m in here reading the older records, I relate a lot from the past to what’s happening now — for example how people are eating during Covid.“The police records for Dunvegan in  show that there was a flour shortage and a policeman was going round and taking note of what everyone had.“It was then reported to the food committee.“That was  years earlier, during the Spanish Flu.

The prescribed psalm tunes would originally have been the same as those for English psalms, using the popular ballad meter, and had names including London New, Kilmarnock, Glasgow and Moravia. However, because this meter wasn’t familiar to the Gaelic ear, the tunes were adapted hugely over time. The tradition has gained recognition internationally as a highly stylized, unique form of musical worship which can be heard in Scotland’s Gaelic-speaking Presbyterian churches, particularly on Lewis, Harris, North Uist and Skye. The Gaelic psalmody tradition developed over the centuries to become a unique form of singing with each syllable of each line encompassing many notes. With a characteristically slow tempo, voices drt in and out, creating a swelling effect often described by those in the tradition as a musical reflection of the world around them, the ebb and flow of the waves and the movement in the sea, the stark nature of the land and sea-scape reflected in the singing. But psalmody was not just heard in churches,and was often heard as part of the soundscape of everyday le. Calum Martin from Callanish in Lewis, told me of his memories of family worship as a child, which took place daily in the morning and evening. Every household would assemble together to sing an extract of a psalm, read a portion of scripture and participate in family prayer. Children would be summoned in from their play to take part, and the whole neighbourhood would resonate with the sounds of each family as they performed their daily rituals. Another tradition, which has been researched and celebrated in recent years by those involved in Pròiseact Bàta nan Salm , was the singing of psalms by people ing by boat from communion services. This happened on several sea lochs in Lewis and Harris. The sound of psalm singing filled the air as the boats left for home turning in separate directions to dferent settlements along the coast, is something that is remembered by many people, often as a poignant memory of a time when spirituality resounded at the heart of the communities.Searching through the catalogue of Tobar an Dualchais I have found numerous examples of sacred singing from these islands from a iety of sources. One example the stunning precenting of Murdina MacDonald from the village ofBallantrushal onLewis. Murdina was born in  and was recorded singing an incredible  psalms and spiritual songs between - by field workers including Thorkild Knudsen, Abby Sale, Morag MacLeod and Francis Collinson. Considering the immense interest in her singing, I found it surprising that I could find so little about her le except where she was born and lived, but the fact that she precented so well outside the church , shows another side to the psalmody tradition which wouldn’t have been visible in public le., written by Peter Grant, plus one hymn in English, The Gospel Ship, an extract of which is below:There is also just one very short extract of her speaking, where she reveals to Abby Sale the distinction between the hymns she is singing, and the psalmody of the established church:                           . But in terms of everyday le, I would like to finish this article with ‘Psalm Tunes’, a poem written by Donald Meek which I think captures this huge societal change beautully and evocatively. –, ,,"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BALMACARA-STEADINGS-EX-4-.jpg","title":"passing places exhibition in balmacaras steadings","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAndy is an accomplished fine artist and mountain guide who rarely undertakes an adventure without a sketchbook.

Mrs Lutton has directed her career towards both academic and non-academic success and has a belief in what she does, stating ‘nothing of value can be achieved without work’. She began teaching in Cambridge House in , the same year as the Rubik’s cube was invented, The Sting was awarded the Oscar for the Best Picture, Kung Fu Fighting was playing on the radio, Abba won the Eurovision Song Contest with Waterloo, a first class stamp was  p, a bag of crisps p, a litre of petrol approximately p and the average house price was pound,.  How times have changed, but she has remained a steady, permanent fixture on the staff and has forgotten more about teaching than many actually know about their own style of pedagogy.Mrs Lutton said she “regards creativity in all we do in education as being a key factor to accomplishment and realises the young people of today must have a comprehensive and caring start in education to enable them to enjoy and value learning”. One of her past pupils, now a teacher in the school, commented: “I imagine when a teacher chooses to retire, they want their pupils to remember the stories shared, the discussions had. That is how I remember my English and Drama lessons with Mrs Lutton. During these lessons, my love of literature was allowed to grow and ultimately led me back.”Mrs Lutton is well qualied, holding a BEd , MSc , PQHand currently completing an EdD . Her thesis addresses how effectively teachers are trained to deal with the increasing range of emotional health and wellbeing problems presented by young people today. This is particularly poignant in the Covid- times in which we now live and work. Mrs Lutton started teaching English, both Language and Literature, Latin and Drama in Cambridge House Grammar School for Girls in January , becoming Head of Drama in the September of that same year. Past pupils commented that she brought Literature to le with her dramatic flair and prowess. She was responsible for the success of many of the school productions such as Macbeth, The Crucible, Our Town and Shaw’s Saint Joan, to name but a few. Additionally, she was closely involved with the annual Inter-Form Drama Competitions, which sought to identy budding stars as well as assisting in the development of transferable skills and capabilities such as self-management, working with others and the honing of interpersonal competencies. Mrs Lutton delighted in organising and accompanying pupils to the theatre, whether locally or further afield, to see their version of the great works of drama. She was fortunate to be, for many years, the Chair of Ulster Drama and in the latter years of this school, a Senior Teacher.She changed the scenery in  to become the Vice Principal of the newly formed Cambridge House Grammar School, the amalgamation of Cambridge House Grammar School for Girls and Cambridge House Grammar School for Boys. This enabled her to influence many key features which are still in evidence today, such as the school badge, unorm and the House System. Approaching many of the iniduals who are patrons of the ious Houses was easy for her, but she particularly enjoyed contacting Marie Jones, a Belfast-based actress and playwright to support Jones House, which Mrs Lutton headed as part of the Senior Leadership Team. One of the Heads of Jones House of that time recalls: “This successful House was involved in many fund-raising activities, such as the Jones House Ball, Bake Sales and Go-Karting which enabled pupils, of all year groups, to work together, along with staff, to raise money for Cancer Research. They were ultimately recognised as Regional Award winners and celebrated at a luncheon in London.” Mrs Lutton encouraged and championed all of these undertakings as she recognised the worth they held in the lives of both pupils and staff’. This role assisted in contributing to her other passion pastoral care. She views this as an area which underpins academic success and contributes to the wider aspects of both school and community le. She has been through what Dickens describes in his opening line of A Tale of Two Cities as ‘the best of times….and ….the worst of times’.  Mrs Lutton was appointed as the Principal in  and has led the school to be one of the top performing grammar schools in the province. She has been the pioneer of many programmes and events, and there have been many successes and positive changes brought to the school as she has moved forward with her vision. The Board of Governors have acknowledged their gratitude for all her work over the years and value the legacy she is leaving within the school. As an inidual, she knows how to handle dficult situations effectively, recruit the right person for the job and remain calm under pressure she has been the go-to-person for a long time. In the title role, she has made everyone feel welcome with her kind words this is part of the value she places on people and the contribution they make to any organisation. Mrs Lutton said: “I believe that having power is about sharing power. I recognise what colleagues do and show appreciation for their work. I encourage people to develop their own ideas and to know they can make mistakes.” This is a testament to her style of leadership the work of other people is acknowledged and respected. She has enjoyed an excellent working relationship with the two Vice Principals and credits the success of the school to the building of these effective relationships.Mrs Lutton considers herself to be ‘caring, with a good sense of humour’. However, she also realises that, as an inidual, she is ‘very determined and can act decisively to achieve what I believe is right’. She has been described as inspirational and has impacted the lives of s of pupils and staff, both past and present, and each one is a better person because of it. Mrs Lutton has taught generations in Ballymena over the past  years, children, parents and grandparents, and has been a stalwart in the ever changing world of education in this area. The school has not looked back since she took up her post as she enjoys keeping up-to-date and strives to be ahead of the times.  A member of staff, who is also a past pupil commented: “As a teacher, Mrs Lutton brought creativity and passion to the classroom, making lessons interesting and fun. She related to the pupils and cared for them greatly and now after dedicating  years to Cambridge House Grammar School, things havent changed. “Mrs Lutton continues to cherish her boys and girls, always putting them at the heart of her decision-making whilst inspiring and motivating her staff. It has been a challenge to keep pace with her level of energy, and a privilege to have worked alongside a true educationalist with such a progressive mind”. Mrs Lutton’s mantra is ‘Always stay true to what you believe in. Have integrity, honesty and a willingness to work hard’. She has given, what some would describe as, a le-time of service to the development of her position on this stage her energy and enthusiasm have been instrumental in ensuring that the school has continued to deliver professional, high-quality education throughout the Covid- crisis.  On her retirement it is hoped that it will be as Dickens describes ‘a far, far better rest I go to than I have ever known’. Mrs Lutton will be missed by all at Cambridge House Grammar School and they trust that her departure is long, happy and healthy, where reading and the theatre remain her greatest passions.

She states - ‘I am an artist. So are you. We share an ability to communicate beyond words. It can be helpful to ground any exchange of thoughts or feelings in material things. We can see and feel and change what moves us.’Ballymena woman Ceri is very proud to be one of the crafters at Midtown Makers.“The Ballymena area has many creative people based at this hub,” she told the .“And in these dficult times of Covid people are turning to art as relief from the stresses and problems of the day.”Ceri invites people of the area to call in at Midtown Makers - Covid regulations apply - and see for themselves the top quality art and crafts on show.“It is the perfect place to pick up Christmas gts,” outlined Ceri.“Of course anyone can buy on-line but I believe there is nothing more satisfying than to view the items first hand, and talk with the stall shop owner or the Midtown Maker manager Jim Stevenson.”BC - Before Covid - the large workshop within the Midtown Makers premises would have been heaving with budding artists.Art therapist Ceri took regular sessions there, and admits she cannot wait to get back to catering for full-houses again.All age groups were catered for.Sooner, rather than later, it is hoped the busy, exciting, entertaining, fun-loving art get-togethers will resume.Ceri is holding zoom therapy and art classes. Numbers for her art Zoom classes are on the increase.“I think people are looking for an outlet, something to take their mind off the gloom and doom around them,” said Ceri.Her website asks the following - ‘Has le dealt you a blow that left your rational thinking mind at a loss  You probably find explanations inadequate. At such times words cannot help. Emotions are not logical or reasonable. Art materials offer you alternative ways to think about le – ways in which you can face previously unthinkable things and find new ways to cope with them.’Ceri points out that ‘personal and intuitive art is a unique and very personal way to communicate,’ and that the exchange through art materials is unique to the person who made the marks and movements.“However this is where I can help,” suggested Ceri. “I don’t decipher or analyse your work but instead hold a space for you to explore le issues through your hands and the materials. I believe the power to deal with your concerns is held in your hands and I offer additional helping ones - filled with art materials.Ceri explained that art therapy provides a safe space to exploreemotional issues using the language of art media.“If you play mindfully and honestly the materials will provide a language that is yours alone. Only you will know the truth of your expression,” she said. When you join Ceri for a one-to-one therapeutic art session the relationship becomes a three-way process - you, the art materials and her.There are a number of classes available. Contact Jim Stevenson at Midtown Makers for further details.Ceri says art is therapeutic for her too, allowing her to do something for herself. And she spoke of the pleasure of watching her first piece of art work being looked at, liked and bought in Midtown Makers.“I was absolutely delighted my art had found an appreciative home,” she concluded.

Andgatherings are allowed at Christmas, which seems likely, it could lead to more restrictions being needed in January.With January a quiet month for retail and hospitality, it is easy to see more restrictions in early .Which businesses are being forced to close Businesses must close including non-essential retail, gyms and swimming pools.Close-contact services and cafes will also have to shut while pubs and licensed restaurants will remain closed throughout.Which businesses will stay open Takeaway and delivery, and food and drink in motorway services, airports and harbour terminals remain open.Off licences will remain open, with an pm closing.How long do the measures last The new restrictions will cover two weeks from November  until December .Why are they needed The Executive has introduced another two-week circuit breaker to slow the spread of Covid- ahead of Christmas and protect the health service.The R-rate - the rate of transmission of the virus - in Northern Ireland is currently sitting at “around one” which runs the risk of hospitals becoming overwhelmed with Covid- within weeks.What support is there for businesses impacted by the fresh closure order A financial support package is to be developed over next few days.What is the advice around working from home Stay at home, work from homepossible and only leave home for essential purposes.What about schools and colleges Schools and childcare facilities will remain open while universities and further education will provide learning at distance except where it is essential to provide it face to face.What are the rules for places of worship, weddings and funerals Churches will close except for weddings, civil partnerships and funerals which are limited to  people.What about sport, including sporting events No indoor sport of any kind or organised contact sport involving household mixing other than at elite level is permitted.Inidual household outdoor exercise and school PE can continue while elite sports events will take place behind closed doors without spectators.What about household visits No household gatherings of more than one household are permitted, other than current arrangements for bubbles with exceptions for caring, maintenance, house moves, etc.Why are ministers taking action now Previous proposals were vetoed by the DUP last week, prompting rivals to accused the party of a major U-turn.On Thursday, Health Minister Robin Swann ed with fresh proposals for even tougher restrictions to save hospitals from being overwhelmed.This time the DUP joined the other parties in supporting the steps.This all sounds very gloomy, is there any reason for hope Yes! Chief Medical Officer Michael McBride said this week that spring could see Northern Ireland in a very dferent place. There are also vaccines on the horizon. Health authorities here will receive .m doses of the Pfizer jab, and .m of the Oxford vaccine, subject to approval by regulators, meaning all of Northern Ireland could be vaccinated in the first roll-out. Each inidual must receive two doses, meaning up to .m people here can be inoculated with the Oxford jab alone. Meanwhile, , people could avail of the Pfizer vaccine, making the overall total .m jabs when both are combined. The population of Northern Ireland is just under .m.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusNI Executive tightens Covid restrictions, but business chiefs scathing of #devastating# move before ChristmasThe Executive on Thursday night announced a two-week circuit- breaker to try to slow the spread of Covid- and protect the health service.GalleryNorthern IrelandSinn Fein lawyers in police talks for Michelle O#Neill interview over Bobby Storey funeral attendanceMichelle O#Neill#s legal representatives are in talks with the PSNI to arrange an interview with the deputy First Minister over her attendance at the Bobby Storey funeral and suspected coronavirus law breaches. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dccced--acf-d-fefac_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dccced--acf-d-fefac_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dccced--acf-d-fefac_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dccced--acf-d-fefac_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fe .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dccced--acf-d-fefac_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandHospitality sector voices frustration at mandatory closuresFrustration has been expressed over the announcement that non-essential retail, pubs and restaurants must close for two weeks.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive agrees tough new restrictions in bid to bring pandemic under control before ChristmasTop : The most sought-after homes on Propertynews as site marks  years NI Executive tightens Covid restrictions, but business chiefs scathing of #devastating# move before ChristmasDUP MP Sammy Wilson hits out at Covid #snoopers# after wearing face mask below his nose on flightPolice investigating hate incident after graffiti painted outside Belfast home ahead of viewings,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Synonymous with massive savings, Black Friday always takes place on the last Friday of November, with Cyber Monday falling three days later. It is a great opportunity for canny consumers to snap up bargains — but you must be prepared. And of course there are some shopping hacks that will help you navigate the sales effectively. Just do not blow your budget and end up out of pocket. While consumers can expect top deals as retailers attempt to boost their coffers, last night’s Executive announcement means it will all be online.Read MoreThe Amazon alternative: Northern Ireland retailers offering food heaven or style lovers’ paradise in a click so you can shop localWhen is Black Friday  Technically, it is November , but lots of retailers have launched early deals to entice customers and increase online sales before the end of the year. Industry experts are predicting that we are going to see some of the biggest discounts ever. The best online deals are normally announced between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which falls on November , , with a few so-called ‘lightning deals’ revealed during the four-day period. Otherwise, there is not expected to be a huge dference in sales prices or products over the course of the weekend. With lockdown  in place in England and, from next Friday in Northern Ireland, Black Friday is expected to be an almost entirely online event this year for many.Simple Black Friday hacksMake a list of what you really want. Consider upcoming birthdays and other events that you may need to buy presents for. And don’t forget to set a budget. Work out the total amount you have to spend on all your purchases and stick to it. And always remember: just because something is in the sale, it does not mean you can’t find the same product or similar where. Always shop around to make sure you are getting the best possible deal. Research the items you want to buy and find out the cheapest price. Websites like PriceSpy, PriceHistory and CamelCamelCamel will give you historical data on prices so you can see how much you should pay.Are Black Friday bargains real The annual hype surrounding Black Friday gives us the impression that once-in-a-letime offers abound, as retailers slash their prices to historic lows for  hours only... but that is rarely the case, according to Which  The consumer watchdog tracked  products on offer in the six months before Black Friday  and the six months afterwards to see whether Black Friday ‘deals’ really do offer the rock-bottom prices many shoppers expect — and they found that they usually didn’t. Instead, they found that % of the discounts they investigated — which included promotions on popular technology, home and personal care products — were available for the same price or cheaper in the six months following the sales.Read MoreBlack Friday set to be best ever for Northern Ireland shoppersHow do you recognise fake Black Friday deals The most basic starting point for any would-be bargain hunter is to check the price of your desired product across multiple websites. Remember: quite often more than one shop will sell a product at a similar price, but only one may claim that the price is a special offer. Let’s say you are in the market for a washing machine, for example. If four outlets are selling the same washing machine for £, but only one is claiming it is a special offer at ‘Now £, was £’, it’s a pretty good indicator that the price is not a particularly special deal so don’t snap it up thinking you are getting a special bargain.How do you find a product’s price history Make a shortlist of the products you want to look out for in the Black Friday sales, and then look them up on websites such as Pricerunner, PriceSpy and CamelCamelCamelto find out their price history, according to Which  This will enable you to know whether Black Friday prices are genuinely worth getting excited about. And be wary of ‘Was’ prices. Products bearing notes such as ‘was £, now £’ are abundant on Black Friday. But don’t let these ‘anchor prices’ mislead you. Retailers shout about savings — often in red to grab our attention — as a way of influencing customers and they can often be quite misleading.How do you get the best deal You know what they say — a bargain is only a bargainyou get a hefty discount on something you actually need. Otherwise, it is just an added expense. Make a comprehensive list of what you are looking for. Don’t forget to sign up to email updates from retailers, download their apps, and follow them on social media. That way, you will get notications in real-time. Also, do your research in advance and bookmark the products at the top of your wish list so you can create a shortcut to seeing the discounts as soon as the offers roll in. Unsurprisingly, Amazon often offers the widest range of deals in the widest range of categories.Bagging a bargainShoppers and stores use social media to share coupon codes and deals so subscribe to your favourite stores so you are aware of any coupons that can be scanned in using your phone.Follow your favourite shops on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and sign up to its deals newsletter to get the latest offers. It is tempting to shop at all the big name stores with the finances to fund glossy ads but why not shop local  Call independents the day before Black Friday ­— many have an online presence — and asktheir deal is any better than the ones advertised at bigger stores. That way, you can support local businesses and still get great deals. What deceptions should you beware of Look out for notes or signs explaining offers. The rules that govern special offers are vague so shops can get away with using ‘was’ prices that haven’t been in place for a long timethey put up a sign explaining the deal. Tactics like that can make offers look better than they are. In some historic cases, the product was actually only at the higher price for a fortnight, six months before the current offer, according to Which  Not all manufacturers have RRPs, but some do and choose to display them on their own websites. Before you buy a product in the sales, check the manufacturer’s website to seeyou are getting a decent discount on the RRP.Where are the best deals  Laptops, games consoles, mobile phones, toys, clothes, big budget electrical goods, tech, beauty, smart devices and kitchen equipment will be up for grabs at a fraction of their usual price. In recent years, Argos, Currys PC World, Very and eBay have worked very hard to beat Amazon’s best prices: all are Black Friday favourites. Few major retailers abstain from the Black Friday sales — although Next is one. It is too soon to say exactly what will be on offer this year, but here are some of the bargains we spotted:Dyson V Absloute Pro Cordless vacuum cleaner - Was £, now £ Tassimo Boscho coffee machine - Was Apple Watch Series  - Was £, now £ Armani Diamonds Eau de Parfum- Was £, now £.

the Mulberry Bush pub West Midlands Police said he was interviewed under caution and released on Thursday, after a search of his home was carried out.Detective Chief Superintendent Kenny Bell, head of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands CTU, said: “We are committed to finding those responsible for the terrible murders of  innocent victims almost  years ago.“Let me assure families of the victims and the people of Birmingham that we’re working relentlessly to find the bombers and bring them to justice.”Mr Reilly’s lawyer Padraig O’Muirigh said his client had been questioned by West Midlands officers “in relation to a number of historic matters” before being released unconditionally.Mr O’Muirigh added: “My client denies any involvement in the matters for which he was questioned including any knowledge of – or role in – the ‘Birmingham Bombs’.”He said: “It is a matter of grave concern that photographs of our client’s home address being searched by police have appeared in media reports.“The publication of these photographs has implications for the safety of my client and his family.“I will be raising this serious development with police and the Police Ombudsman.”At an inquest into the bombings last year, a jury concluded a botched IRA warning call on the night led to  people being unlawfully killed.The bungled West Midlands Police inquiry in the immediate aftermath of the bombings led to the wrongful convictions of the Birmingham Six, one of the worst miscarriages of justice in legal history.They were freed in  after their convictions were quashed.During evidence given at last year’s inquest, an anonymous IRA volunteer named the men he said had been involved in the attacks.The inidual – identied at the hearing only as Witness O – said those who took part were Mick Murray, Seamus McLoughlin and James Francis Gavin, as well as a fourth man, Michael Hayes, who now lives in Dublin.The arrest came a month after Home Secretary Priti Patel said she would consider holding a public inquiry into the bombings.Ms Patel also said she wants to visit Birmingham to meet justice campaigners, including Julie Hambleton, whose -year-old sister Maxine died in the bombings.Ms Hambleton, who is part of the victims’ families’ campaign group Justice  The , had called the arrest “monumental”.PAMost ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive agrees tough new

Ritchie  Co to become the headquarters of the fledgling TV stationMargaret CanningTwitterEmailNovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA TV historian who objected to the demolition of Havelock House in Belfast has said he will now campaign for it to be listed.Havelock House was the home of broadcaster UTV from  to , and was bought by a developer which planned to knock it down and built apartments on the Ormeau Road site.According to records held by the Department for Communities, it was built as a linen warehouse in  for James Thompson  Sons. Before UTV took it over, it had been occupied by JM Ritchie  Co, which made ladies# clothing.Belfast City Council#s planning committee has now voted to reject the application by London firm Olympian Homes. Reasons included concerns about the impact on residents in Donegall Pass, and the risk the eight-storey block could dominate nearby listed buildings.TV historian Ken Grfin, who organised the Save Havelock House campaign group, said he was delighted the development was knocked back. He said: It was a development which would have a detrimental impact on our built heritage and the lives of local residents. Havelock House is a key part of our shared history and Save Havelock House looks forward to working with stakeholders to ensure that it is redeveloped in a manner which supports the local community.Our short-term plan will be to launch a campaign pushing for the building to be given listed status during its th anniversary year in .Historic Environment Division, a section within the Department for Communities, had declined to carrying out a survey to seethe building should be listed. But HED had still objected to the application on the basis of its impact on listed buildings nearby.Alliance councillor Emmet McDonough-Brown, who spoke against the application at Tuesday#s meeting, said he believed the site would make a great museum or community hub.Mr Grfin has said the building and studios should be preserved as the last surviving example in Ireland of a studio from the early days of TV broadcasts.Gerry Kelly, who presented chat show Kelly from Havelock House between  and , said the interior of Havelock House was like a warren. Regardless of all the work they did down the years, it was still a very awkward-shaped building. The location was always good but the building itself never really suited a TV station, no matter how many changes they did to it, he recalled.There was a small studio, and a smaller one where the news was broadcast in the early days. Kelly started in the small studio, then a new one, where Kelly was for  or  years. Every corner of that studio has a memory of me as our guests were a who#s who of the s and early s. Celine Dion was on the show. My daughter is a massive Celine Dion fan and I told her we had her on, and she nearly died. But Celine Dion was practically an unknown at that time. She had represented Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest and that#s why we had her on. He contrasted UTV#s present home at City Quays, adding: UTV#s premises now is really an office block and there are no studios as such.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive agrees tough new restrictions in bid to bring pandemic under control before ChristmasTop : The most sought-after homes on Propertynews as site marks  years NI Executive tightens Covid restrictions, but business chiefs scathing of #devastating# move before ChristmasDUP MP Sammy Wilson hits out at Covid #snoopers# after wearing face mask below his nose on flightPolice investigating hate incident after graffiti painted outside Belfast home ahead of viewings,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Neil McCafferty was admitted to Altnagelvin Hospital with a gall bladder infection where he subsequently contracted the deadly virus. His health deteriorated further when he developed sepsis which is a potentially le-threatening condition caused by the bodys response to an infection. The Derry News spoke to the McCafferty family last month when they felt that due to other underlying conditions, the odds were stacked against their loved one, and he would need a ‘miracle’ to pull through. Mr McCafferty is married to Bridie and a father of five to son Michael and four daughters Andrea, Karen, Sinead and Emma. googletag.cmd.push At the time, they were told that the next -hours was critical and were advised to ‘prepare for the worst’. Speaking this week, Neil’s son Michael said doctors are ‘baffled’ that he managed to pull through. “They had offered him all the support, they were trialling a drug on him for the Covid and it seemed to have worked,” he added. Doctors made every effort to bring him round, from tweaking oxygen support to seehe was responsive, to stabilising his blood pressure and treating the sepsis. The family described it as an emotional rollercoaster over the past six weeks. googletag.cmd.push Michael elaborated: “My mother described it as ‘having a wake without the body’. We were waiting for news and updates. “Not being able to visit, although we completely understand why, made it more dficult.” ‘FANTASTIC’ When Neil first entered the hospital, being unable to communicate with their loved one added to the family’s anxiety and sense of helplessness. However, over the past month Altnagelvin staff, particularly those working in the ICU, have been ‘fantastic’ and provided them with daily updates. “It was comforting for us, they were very nice to us and treated us on a very personal level,” Michael said.     “My father started showing signs that he was getting better little by little, every day, until the point they decided to take him off the ventilator. “At times it has been disturbing to watch because at the start we were looking at him hooked up to machines. “We were emotional wrecks you wouldn’t believe the pain you go through looking at somebody like that and not being able to hold their hand or hug them.” Eventually the persistence of health professionals paid off and Neil started showing signs of improvement. “A tracheostomywas carried out to help him breathe. “But he was bypassing it and breathing himself and doctors decided to take him off it. “They’ve cleared his lungs of Covid which is fantastic and other organs have been working well. “He eventually started to come round and during a video call we seen his eyes open for the first time and him being able to nod his head.” While there is demonstrable improvement the family are conscious that Neil has a long road to recovery ahead. There are indications that he may have taken a stroke, which doctors confirmed can happen with Covid. Michael explained: “It’s all rehabilitation now. It’s a long road ahead but from being told he might have -hours to where we are now is a blessing. “On one of his good days, he was speaking to us and said ‘they tell me I’ve been very unwell’, and my mother said, ‘you have, Neil, but you’ve done fantastic.”  HOPE The McCafferty family wanted to express how proud they are of the people of Derry for their ‘overwhelming support’. Goodwill messages flooded in as Neil is well-known in the local community as a manager at the former Peter England shirt factory at Maydown. People from England, China, Bangladesh and beyond have also been in touch who met Neil through his work as an Operations Director in China. A number of local politicians were a great support such as Martina Anderson who checked in with the family every day. Praying to Sister Clare has also been a source of spiritual guidance for Neil’s we Bridie and their daughters. There was cross community support and people of all faiths offered up prayers in their time of need which will not be forgotten by the family. Musician Christy Moore and Neil’s beloved Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. even reached out. “We were trying to think of anything that would will him on to fight it,” Michael said. He added that they have tremendous sympathy for families who have lost loved ones. “We would like to express our condolences for the families who have lost loved ones during this very dficult time and offer our prayers and support for those families with loved ones currently battling this terrible illness. “We hope that our dad’s situation may offer hope to those who are currently suffering the impact of this terrible virus. “We’d like to take this opportunity to express our thanks to the amazing staff nurses and doctors working in ICU who have been caring for our dad in so many ways. “We thank you for the personal care and encouragement you displayed to him and us as a family over the past number of weeks. “These medical staff are worth more than their weight in gold and should be commended for their bravery and respect shown to the patients and their families during this dficult time,” Michael concluded.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Things have changed since then and as Jim prepares to retire from what is now St Brigids College in Carnhill after almost  years service, he looks back at a career and a job that has changed dramatically. Jim was brought up in the Lecky Road area in the Bogside, the eldest child of Eileen and Charlie Zammitts four boys and one girl. After attending the Brow-o-the-Hill Christian Brothers primary school, he went to St Peters High School, being one of the first first-year pupils at the newly-opened Creggan secondary school. googletag.cmd.push Recalling that broadcaster Joe Mahon was his form teacher in fourth fth year, he said: “Back in those days, the Troubles were at their height and I would have passed the army going up and down Eastway. There were riots in the afternoon as I went home, but that was just normal, thats the way it was.” After leaving St Peters, Jim went to The Tech to do an engineering course. However, it was not for long. He said: “It just wasnt for me. I saw the job for Carnhill advertised and I applied and, luckily, I got it. “Back then the school operated across three sites – Pennyburn Youth Club, Slievemore Primary School and Steelstown Primary School. I worked between two sites, Pennyburn and Slievemore. I would have walked between the two and sometimes was lucky enough to get a bus. But I was young enough and it did not bother me walking anywhere.” googletag.cmd.push Jim started in January  and he spent nine months between the two sites. He said the opening of the current school, now known as St Brigids College, in September  resulted in him going back to school himself. “When we moved to the new building I was given the choice of being full-time science or full-time woodwork technician and I opted for science and, just by chance, there was a day release course at The Tech for school science technicians over three years and it was a matter of learning on the job after that.” Jim explained what his new role in the school was.     “It entailed, basically, looking after the teachers requirements for equipment, chemicals and stuff like that as well as being responsible for stock, the acquisition of all the chemicals, stationery and equipment.”  Jimdescribed the new school building as amazing. He added: “It was state-of-the art. It was quite a step up from going into a hut where the facilities were really basic and going to a purpose-built school with state-of-the-art facilities.” And things were to change even more. He said: “Back then, for example, it was blackboards and chalk. We moved on a bit to have one television and a video between five six teachers which would have been loaned out of a first-come-first-served basis. “We have come on even further to where every classroom has an intercative whiteboard, a projector and everything is at the flick of a switch. Everything has changed dramatically, everything is computerised.” In latter years, Jims work took him beyond the science room. He explained: “In recent years, I got to take groups of sixth formers an afternoon a week to the University of Ulster at Magee for what was called A Step Up science course. But mostly the job was very much behind the scenes.” Like many, the coronavirus pandemic has affected how Jim performed his job over the past seven months. He said: “The school was closed from March to the end of August. I am sure it was dficult for the teachers with online teaching. As for me, I did whatever I could from home, that included preparing acquisition for the coming year and stuff like that. “When we went back it was a dferent world – masks and hand sanitisers everywhere you turned, social distancing and everybody doing their best and being as careful as they can. As I said, it was a dferent world.” Looking back, Jim said he enjoyed his  years at the school and had made many friends. “I made many good friends over the years, far too many to list. I have seen every member of staff come and go. There were a few pranksters in science and we had a few laughs.” However, he admitted he had mixed feelings about his leaving. He said: “I will be going with mixed feelings and mixed emotions because you dont work in a place for  years and not have a very strong bond with the school and the people in it.” He added: “I hope the school keeps going from strength-to-strength and it will always be in my memory. “I would like to thank everybody for being great friends over the years and I will miss you all.” And he had a message for the students: “Good luck, do your best and be proud of your school.” Due to the coronavirus restrictions, Jim has no immediate plans although he intends to see a lot more of his son, David, a clinical psychologist in London. He explained: “Marie, my we, retired a couple of months ago and whenever, and I say whenever not , this Covid is all over and we get back to some sort of normality, we plan to do a bit of travelling. In the meantime, I will take things easy and do a bit of walking and enjoy retirement for a while.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Colm Scullion, from Bellaghy, shared a cell with Bobby Sands in the late s in the lead up to the  hunger strike in which Scullions fellow Bellaghy native, Tom McElwee, also died. During the lecture, Colm told Stephen McCracken about some of the lesser-known traits of Bobby Sands character, including his love of music. “Bobby was a very ordinary guy, but he had extraordinary talent,” said Colm. “He definitely had that s image about him. I remember years later watching a programme called Sessions from the s. It showed you dferent folk or ballad groups out of Ireland. googletag.cmd.push “I remember seeing footage of Donal Lunny with the long hair and the gingham shirt, and the way he was playing the bazouki, and his whole body language looked very like Bobby. “I remember one night it was lashing out of the heavens . We had no glass in the windows and it was great just to stand at the window and put your hands out and feel the rain. “We couldnt see each other obviously, but there was a whole row of us standing feeling the rain coming in, and out of the blue Bobby started to sing Have Your Ever Seen The Rain by Creedance. googletag.cmd.push “The next thing the whole wing was singing it. When he would do Mandolin Wind, some of the guys would be on the doors like drums and a bit of mouth music for the banjo and that.” Scullion also described how the leader of the  hunger strike would conduct his writing process at a time when the dirty protest was ongoing. “The cell would have been covered in s**t obviously, but the only place you kept clean was a wee bit beside your mattress on the ground,” said Colm. “Beside my mattress and Bobbys was a wee square, and you had the lead of a pencil, and that was the only thing you had to write with.     “At the door, there was a place left clean as well. If you were doing your Irish class, youd have been listening at the door and taking notes there. “You had to spit on it and rub it all out again afterwards, but everybody had the lead of a pencil, it was a very important piece of machinery. “It was that sort of atmosphere he was writing in. He didnt like you seeing them [his poems] until he was finished. “He would have paced the cell up and down with a blanket round him and he had the wee peann luaidheas we called it, the lead of the pencil, in his hand. “When he was satisfied with what he had written down, he would have called everybody to the door and read it out. On many occasions it was then written down on toilet paper and sent outside.” The online lecture features a foreword and performance by Christy Moore. Although he had grown up in Rathcoole and Twinbrook, estates on the outskirts of Belfast, Colm Scullion told viewers how Bobby Sands was intrigued by the countryside, and at times it acted as an inspiration for his poetry. Colm explained a piece called Roddy McCorley showed the ability Sands had to portray somewhere which would have been totally unfamiliar to him. “The story of Roddy McCorley passed down through our family and that he had stayed in our palce while on the run,” he said. “Years later I did some research and found the names associated with McCorley were all in Ballyscullion. I related the story as daddy related it to me, but Bobby was intrigued. “He wrote this poem, and I have to say, for someone who never set foot in Ballyscullion, its an absolute work of art. Lough Beag is in it, so is Ballyscullion and Crosskeys places you can all visualise.” Sands love of poetry made him the butt of jokes when he tried to organise a visit with a poet who had been dead for almost  years. “He was big into Ethna Carberry, whose proper name was Anna Johnston He was reading her poems and stuff, so he decided hed send invite her to visit.” explained Colm. “He wanted to get her up, so some of the people on the outside in the Sinn Feacutein office tried to arrange it, but the word came through that Ethna Carberry had died in  or . “He got dogs abuse for that. That went on for ages about Ethna Carberry coming to visit Bobby.” The Bellaghy man also touched on the moment he heard his friend and former cell-mate had passed away. “That night I was in the cell with Ricky [ORawe]. Bik had the radio. It was permanently tuned into Radio Ulster. We knew to pick it up about five to midnight to get the news,” said Colm. “The night Bobby died, I remember Bik shouting up, rith suas chuig an fhuinneog – run up to the window, and he said, fuair Roibeard baacutes cupla noimead oacute shin – Bobby died a few minutes ago. “I remember the blood leaving me and myself and Ricky just broke down.” The hour-long lecture, hosted by Trasna na Tiacutere, and featuring a foreword by Christy Moore, is currently available to view via their YouTube channel:   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Colm Scullion, from Bellaghy, shared a cell with Bobby Sands in the late s in the lead up to the  hunger strike in which Scullions fellow Bellaghy native, Tom McElwee, also died. During the lecture, Colm told Stephen McCracken about some of the lesser-known traits of Bobby Sands character, including his love of music. “Bobby was a very ordinary guy, but he had extraordinary talent,” said Colm. “He definitely had that s image about him. I remember years later watching a programme called Sessions from the s. It showed you dferent folk or ballad groups out of Ireland. googletag.cmd.push “I remember seeing footage of Donal Lunny with the long hair and the gingham shirt, and the way he was playing the bazouki, and his whole body language looked very like Bobby. “I remember one night it was lashing out of the heavens . We had no glass in the windows and it was great just to stand at the window and put your hands out and feel the rain. “We couldnt see each other obviously, but there was a whole row of us standing feeling the rain coming in, and out of the blue Bobby started to sing Have Your Ever Seen The Rain by Creedance. googletag.cmd.push “The next thing the whole wing was singing it. When he would do Mandolin Wind, some of the guys would be on the doors like drums and a bit of mouth music for the banjo and that.” Scullion also described how the leader of the  hunger strike would conduct his writing process at a time when the dirty protest was ongoing. “The cell would have been covered in s**t obviously, but the only place you kept clean was a wee bit beside your mattress on the ground,” said Colm. “Beside my mattress and Bobbys was a wee square, and you had the lead of a pencil, and that was the only thing you had to write with.     “At the door, there was a place left clean as well. If you were doing your Irish class, youd have been listening at the door and taking notes there. “You had to spit on it and rub it all out again afterwards, but everybody had the lead of a pencil, it was a very important piece of machinery. “It was that sort of atmosphere he was writing in. He didnt like you seeing them [his poems] until he was finished. “He would have paced the cell up and down with a blanket round him and he had the wee peann luaidheas we called it, the lead of the pencil, in his hand. “When he was satisfied with what he had written down, he would have called everybody to the door and read it out. On many occasions it was then written down on toilet paper and sent outside.” The online lecture features a foreword and performance by Christy Moore. Although he had grown up in Rathcoole and Twinbrook, estates on the outskirts of Belfast, Colm Scullion told viewers how Bobby Sands was intrigued by the countryside, and at times it acted as an inspiration for his poetry. Colm explained a piece called Roddy McCorley showed the ability Sands had to portray somewhere which would have been totally unfamiliar to him. “The story of Roddy McCorley passed down through our family and that he had stayed in our palce while on the run,” he said. “Years later I did some research and found the names associated with McCorley were all in Ballyscullion.

Captaining Ireland was among the proudest moments in my le because I am an Irishman to the core. But despite being able to do these things, I have always been conscious of the fact that some rights are still denied to me because I happen to have been born in the North. I can captain my country, but I still can’t vote for my country’s President. I can represent the FAIat home and abroad, but I can’t have any democratic say in the make up of the government that funds it. googletag.cmd.push Partition is re with such failures and contradictions. To me, it simply doesn’t make sense to have two ‘national’ football teams on an island this size never mind two health systems, two education systems and two governments. As an Irish man and an Irish citizen, I want the island of Ireland to be reunied under a government for all our people. I don’t want to have any technicalities, caveats or doubts questioning my nationality. And I strongly believe that everyone who lives on this island should be entitled to the same rights as each other. The best way to achieve all of that is through the reunication of our island and the creation of a new all-Ireland administration that governs in the best interests of the people. googletag.cmd.push I am certainly not alone in that belief. Every day, more and more people are coming to the same conclusion when they look at what is happening with Brexit, austerity and the handling of the pandemic. And at the end of the day, all we are asking for is the right to choose our own future through a referendum on Irish unity. That’s democracy and what has anyone got to be afraid of in that  I want my children to grow up in a better country than the one I and generations before me, grew up in. Surely that is what all parents want.     I am convinced that a better Ireland is possible through reunication. So let’s have the debate. Let’s have the vote. And let’s win it!  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Captaining Ireland was among the proudest moments in my le because I am an Irishman to the core. But despite being able to do these things, I have always been conscious of the fact that some rights are still denied to me because I happen to have been born in the North. I can captain my country, but I still can’t vote for my country’s President. I can represent the FAIat home and abroad, but I can’t have any democratic say in the make up of the government that funds it. googletag.cmd.push Partition is re with such failures and contradictions. To me, it simply doesn’t make sense to have two ‘national’ football teams on an island this size never mind two health systems, two education systems and two governments. As an Irish man and an Irish citizen, I want the island of Ireland to be reunied under a government for all our people. I don’t want to have any technicalities, caveats or doubts questioning my nationality. And I strongly believe that everyone who lives on this island should be entitled to the same rights as each other. The best way to achieve all of that is through the reunication of our island and the creation of a new all-Ireland administration that governs in the best interests of the people. googletag.cmd.push I am certainly not alone in that belief. Every day, more and more people are coming to the same conclusion when they look at what is happening with Brexit, austerity and the handling of the pandemic. And at the end of the day, all we are asking for is the right to choose our own future through a referendum on Irish unity. That’s democracy and what has anyone got to be afraid of in that  I want my children to grow up in a better country than the one I and generations before me, grew up in. Surely that is what all parents want.     I am convinced that a better Ireland is possible through reunication. So let’s have the debate. Let’s have the vote. And let’s win it!  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mollie McCamleywon the title of Miss Ireland in  and was chosen to take part in the Miss World final at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Mollie, who is originally from Donegal but has lived in Maghera with her husband John and family for  years, appeared on stage before a worldwide TV audience of  million people. Mollie recalled how the bingo was cancelled in her home village of Newtowncunningham on the night of the famous contest. googletag.cmd.push  Mollie said: “The Miss Donegal contest was held in the Butt Hall in Ballybofey. A few weeks before the final I had gone there to the usual dance. They were picking girls and I was picked and I had to go back again for the final. “On the night of the Miss Donegal final, my friend, Edy Coyle, and I thumbed a lt to Ballybofey. I won it that night. It was the best of craic. “The highlight of the night for me was that my favourite singer, Joe Dolan, was playing. I remember thinking this was great and when Joe presented my with the trophy, it just made my night. At that time we followed Joe everywhere because he was my favourite singer. googletag.cmd.push “I didnt realise how important Miss Donegal was. I just took it in my stride. “I had been Miss Teen Donegal six months prior to that. That had started off as Miss Teen Raphoe, then Miss Teen Donegal, then onto Kildare for Miss Teen Ireland, but I didnt win that. “At that time we were living in Ardee in Newton. The Miss Ireland contest was held in the InterContinental Hotel in Dublin and I went up on my own on the bus from Derry.  “I hired out a dress in Dublin. It was a lot of money. I was working in the Belvoir Shirt Factory in Newton at the time,” said Mollie.     There were  girls in the Miss Ireland competition and Mollie recalled that the compere was Jimmy Saville. Mollie said: “I was very excited but I took it all in my stride. The girls were all nice. I made a lot of friends even though I had nobody with me in Dublin. I had a lovely time and then you went to Miss World. “The Miss World contest was absolutely amazing. We stayed in the Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane in London. “There were four girls picked that year in the Miss Ireland Final. One went to Miss Universe one to Miss Europe and Miss Derry went to Miss International. Mine was the last name to be called out, so I qualied for Miss World. I felt great. “I had to phone the local post office in Newtown and ask them to deliver the news up to the family in Ardee,” laughed Mollie. On the night of Miss Ireland, Mollies father, James, was in Scotland and her brother, John, was in London. Her mother, Ruby, was at home in Newton, with her sister, Patricia, and her brothers, Martin, Billy and Seamus.  Mollie said: “The post office in Newtown went up to tell Mammy and them I had won at  oclock in the morning. “There was no phone or electricity in the house. We only got electricity in  when we moved up to a wee house in Newton, Colehill, near the Garda Station. “When I came home from Dublin the next night, there were bonfires lit everywhere and they had a big do for me in the Columban Hall. It was packed. I felt good. I felt delighted. I was very calm. I knew I had done well. I had to do a few dferent courses before the Miss World competition. I also modelled in Dublin.” Mollies friend, Annette Burke , from Newton also remembered the night well. She said: “While we were waiting for Mollie coming home from Dublin, there were bonfires lit all along the way as you came into Newton and there was a dance. Columban Hall. “There wasnt a soul on the streets of Newton on the night of the Miss World Contest either. “It was a great time. Edy Coyle, Daphne Hannigan and myself would have been friends with Mollie. I remember we used to thumb lts to Letterkenny too from Newton, every Sunday evening, and we would have gone to the Dolphin and had chips,” said Annette.  Mollies Miss World preparation included a trip to Majorca. “Part of the Miss World contest was that I got a two-week trip to Majorca before the big night itself. It was with a modelling agency and they put us through dferent courses before the competition. “We had a lot of tours during our Miss World time in London. It was hard work. “We were going here, there and everywhere. I got a lot of press. I was in London about  or  days before the Miss World competition and we were out of the hotel before  noon the morning after and on the way back to Dublin. “I went on my own to London. I flew over. I went to Dublin where I met a woman from the modelling agency. She took me to the airport and I flew into London and I was met by a Rolls Royce. “It was the first time I was ever in London and the first time I was ever in a Rolls Royce, which took me straight to the Grosvenor House Hotel.” The Miss World contestants had the complete first floor of the hotel to themselves. Mollie recalled: “We were not allowed downstairs without our chaperones. We were chaperoned the whole time. “The organisers were very strict. I suppose, we were under their care and they had to look after us. I had just turned . It was hard work too. In the morning you were up from about am because you had to get your make-up done every day. However, I was not really fazed. I had great confidence in myself. “We went on lots of tours in London, including Madam Tussauds. I met the singer Engelbert Humperdinck. I have a photograph in the hall here of me and Engelbert. “I also met the comedian Bob Hope and the singer Glen Campbell. Joan Collins was one of the Miss World judges in . Michael Aspel, Keith Fordyce and Bob Hope were the presenters that year and Jenner Hosten from Grenada was crowned Miss World. “The contest was on the television on November , immediately after the news. There was bingo in Newton that night, but it was cancelled. Mammy went to a neighbours house to watch it because a lot of people had no electricity. “For Miss World, my clothes were sponsored from dferent fashion shops in Dublin. I remember I had a lovely big coat. “It was only the last seven contestants that they really talked to on television. There were about  girls in the contest but I didnt come back in the last seven. My friend, Annette recently sent me a wee clip of video I had never seen before, which was filmed on the night of Miss World, of me in my national costume. It was lovely to see it after all of these years,” said Mollie. Depicted in the  film Misbehaviour, Miss World  is also remembered for the flour-bombing of the stage by feminists opposed to the contest. Mollie said: “We were all backstage and didnt know what was going on and we were out of the hotel by noon. “There was great excitement when I came home. I did dferent presentations and opened a supermarket in Glenties.  “I also judged Beauty contests. I enjoyed everything. I enjoyed the whole experience. It was the experience of a letime and I still think about it with great fondness.” Mollie moved from Newton to Maghera, where she has lived for the past  years, because her husband John worked for the Bank of Ireland. She said: “We started off in Derry and then went to Lisnaskea in County Fermanagh because John was working in the bank up there. “Then the bank opened in Maghera and we came here to live here. I love Maghera. “My son, John, works in Dungannon and my daughter, Claire, lectures in Huddersfield. “I am often back in was in Newton. I was there six weeks ago but I am not allowed up at the minute. “I still have all of the newspaper cuttings from Miss World. “I was on the front of the Sunday Independent and the Sunday Press. “It was a happy experience of a letime,” said a modest Mollie.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I was working in the Belvoir Shirt Factory in Newton at the time,” said Mollie.     There were  girls in the Miss Ireland competition and Mollie recalled that the compere was Jimmy Saville. Mollie said: “I was very excited but I took it all in my stride. The girls were all nice. I made a lot of friends even though I had nobody with me in Dublin. I had a lovely time and then you went to Miss World. “The Miss World contest was absolutely amazing. We stayed in the Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane in London. “There were four girls picked that year in the Miss Ireland Final. One went to Miss Universe one to Miss Europe and Miss Derry went to Miss International. Mine was the last name to be called out, so I qualied for Miss World. I felt great. “I had to phone the local post office in Newtown and ask them to deliver the news up to the family in Ardee,” laughed Mollie. On the night of Miss Ireland, Mollies father, James, was in Scotland and her brother, John, was in London. Her mother, Ruby, was at home in Newton, with her sister, Patricia, and her brothers, Martin, Billy and Seamus.  Mollie said: “The post office in Newtown went up to tell Mammy and them I had won at  oclock in the morning. “There was no phone or electricity in the house. We only got electricity in  when we moved up to a wee house in Newton, Colehill, near the Garda Station. “When I came home from Dublin the next night, there were bonfires lit everywhere and they had a big do for me in the Columban Hall. It was packed. I felt good. I felt delighted. I was very calm. I knew I had done well. I had to do a few dferent courses before the Miss World competition. I also modelled in Dublin.” Mollies friend, Annette Burke , from Newton also remembered the night well. She said: “While we were waiting for Mollie coming home from Dublin, there were bonfires lit all along the way as you came into Newton and there was a dance. Columban Hall. “There wasnt a soul on the streets of Newton on the night of the Miss World Contest either. “It was a great time. Edy Coyle, Daphne Hannigan and myself would have been friends with Mollie. I remember we used to thumb lts to Letterkenny too from Newton, every Sunday evening, and we would have gone to the Dolphin and had chips,” said Annette.  Mollies Miss World preparation included a trip to Majorca. “Part of the Miss World contest was that I got a two-week trip to Majorca before the big night itself. It was with a modelling agency and they put us through dferent courses before the competition. “We had a lot of tours during our Miss World time in London. It was hard work. “We were going here, there and everywhere. I got a lot of press. I was in London about  or  days before the Miss World competition and we were out of the hotel before  noon the morning after and on the way back to Dublin. “I went on my own to London. I flew over. I went to Dublin where I met a woman from the modelling agency. She took me to the airport and I flew into London and I was met by a Rolls Royce. “It was the first time I was ever in London and the first time I was ever in a Rolls Royce, which took me straight to the Grosvenor House Hotel.” The Miss World contestants had the complete first floor of the hotel to themselves. Mollie recalled: “We were not allowed downstairs without our chaperones. We were chaperoned the whole time. “The organisers were very strict. I suppose, we were under their care and they had to look after us. I had just turned . It was hard work too. In the morning you were up from about am because you had to get your make-up done every day. However, I was not really fazed. I had great confidence in myself. “We went on lots of tours in London, including Madam Tussauds. I met the singer Engelbert Humperdinck. I have a photograph in the hall here of me and Engelbert. “I also met the comedian Bob Hope and the singer Glen Campbell. Joan Collins was one of the Miss World judges in . Michael Aspel, Keith Fordyce and Bob Hope were the presenters that year and Jenner Hosten from Grenada was crowned Miss World. “The contest was on the television on November , immediately after the news. There was bingo in Newton that night, but it was cancelled. Mammy went to a neighbours house to watch it because a lot of people had no electricity. “For Miss World, my clothes were sponsored from dferent fashion shops in Dublin. I remember I had a lovely big coat. “It was only the last seven contestants that they really talked to on television. There were about  girls in the contest but I didnt come back in the last seven. My friend, Annette recently sent me a wee clip of video I had never seen before, which was filmed on the night of Miss World, of me in my national costume. It was lovely to see it after all of these years,” said Mollie. Depicted in the  film Misbehaviour, Miss World  is also remembered for the flour-bombing of the stage by feminists opposed to the contest. Mollie said: “We were all backstage and didnt know what was going on and we were out of the hotel by noon. “There was great excitement when I came home. I did dferent presentations and opened a supermarket in Glenties.  “I also judged Beauty contests. I enjoyed everything. I enjoyed the whole experience. It was the experience of a letime and I still think about it with great fondness.” Mollie moved from Newton to Maghera, where she has lived for the past  years, because her husband John worked for the Bank of Ireland. She said: “We started off in Derry and then went to Lisnaskea in County Fermanagh because John was working in the bank up there. “Then the bank opened in Maghera and we came here to live here. I love Maghera. “My son, John, works in Dungannon and my daughter, Claire, lectures in Huddersfield. “I am often back in was in Newton. I was there six weeks ago but I am not allowed up at the minute. “I still have all of the newspaper cuttings from Miss World. “I was on the front of the Sunday Independent and the Sunday Press. “It was a happy experience of a letime,” said a modest Mollie.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Speaking after Sundays defeat to Meath, Cunningham stressed the need to build a club within the county squad,Derry camogie is going to push on to the next level. Cunningham steered Derry to Ulster glory during his last tenure and was appointed this year on a three-year deal at the start of . He met with Derry officials on Sunday in Templeport and is rubber-stamped to stay at the helm. “The future is bright for Derry, but theyhave to stay together to be able to push on,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push Cunningham hinted at adding someone to his management team to keep the momentum moving and after their short window since lockdown, the squad needs a consistent run of games. “It has been a crazy year,” he admitted. “Those young girls...they need a league under their belt and to go into the championship with seven or eight games played. This year, they were thrown in right at the deep end, it is a credit to them. “They have been playing away with their club, but I have to try and build a club within Derry. It is hard to do it in that short space of time.” googletag.cmd.push Cunningham stressed that it didnt matter who was managing the county, they were only a facilitator. The real power lies within the clubs. “The Derry clubs need to push the best players towards the county, they have to. If it is a strong county, it is a strong club scene. “Slaughtneil retained their title, Swatragh pushed them to a replay, Ballinascreen were dogged against them in the semi-final and Lavey put in a good show against Swatragh. “The club is your foundation, but I would love to get all the top players playing for Derry. It needs to be seen as the big prize...the big apple. If it is, there is a possibility for development in Derry and to push on.”     Meath came through the league unbeaten, with hard-fought wins over Cork and Kilkenny, who Derry have both beaten in recent seasons. For Cunningham, it is not about getting a consistent set of results. “You can only get to that standardyou unite like a club team within your county. To unite like that, we have to get a chance to develop them. “When you come inat the start, its hard to feel part of it. It takes a while and thats my aim, to make them feel part of the county scene. That they want to come to the county and they go and tell their club mates to come and see what it is like. “I am bitterly disappointed , but I see a bright future and the key is keeping those girls together and adding to it to keep them hungry and pushing on.” For a full report, photos and reaction from Derrys defeat to Meath, grab a copy of this weeks County Derry Post.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To have two South Derry acts in the final of a UK-wide competition is a great coup for the area, but for all associated with St Patricks College, there can only be one winner. “Fair play to Jonny [Brooks], he has a superb voice as well. Its just a pity the two are up against each other, but as Brooke is a past pupil, well be supporting her %,” said Jolene. “She was this tiny girl, with long curly hair, this bubbly, friendly personality and a massive voice.

She can grab the audiences attention. “When she gets on stage, and I know its a cliché, but she can captivate an audience with her ability to perform and move around the stage. “Whether her song is upbeat or a slow ballad, she can bring that emotion to her performance. She just knows how to deliver a song. “She is a star. I had mentioned to her to go for these major competitions but the timing was never right. “Now the timing is right.” The final of the The Voice UK  will be aired on Saturday November  at .pm on ITV.

Remember my name.”  Local Voice UK finalist Brooke Scullion was just  when she took on a leading role in a production of Fame at her old secondary school, St Patricks College in Maghera. Its unlikely she would have been aware of how prophetic the finales lyrics would prove, but her former music teacher Jolene Conway was already thinking ahead. “Its amazing how things have worked out,” she told Derry Now. “From a leading lady in that musical, shes now gone on to a much bigger stage. I thought it was quite prophetic, I looked back at it the other day. “When she was performing then, you could see what was ahead of her. She was very easy to cast. By Year , she was Head Girl and we ran a Magic of the Musicals show. googletag.cmd.push “She was Deloris Van Cartier in Sister Act and then went on to be Donna, the mother from Mamma Mia. “In between, she was part of the choir and competitions all through school, but she was an integral part of the performing arts and music department.” Brookes lines in school musical Fame have proven prophetic. Even as a Year , Brookes voice was already instantly recognisable throughout the corridors of St Pats. Two years previously, while competing as a Year , the Bellaghy singer blew away the competition to win the schools Stars in Your Eyes talent show. “She was one of the youngest in the competition. She had entered just by chance, really. She had been involved in choir, but this was her first big solo on stage in front of an audience at night,” said Jolene. googletag.cmd.push “After winning that competition, people got to know the voice, and then she became involved in the musicals we would have run in school as well. “Its funny, she sang Stay by Rihanna, and that was the same song she sang in the knock out stage of the Voice. So, all those years later, she sang the same song.” Brookes rise has been meteoric since The Voice competitions early rounds in a pre-lockdown . As well as clinching a place in the final last weekend, she used the imposed hiatus caused by the Covid- pandemic to release a debut single – Attention.     A still from the video for Brookes debut single Attention. She has charmed audiences and coaches alike throughout the show, but behind her confident, bubbly exterior lies a ferocious work ethic. “Its easy for people to see her on stage and see this very confident girl, but she works very hard to get her performances polished. I know that from working with her,” said Jolene. “Brooke is a confident girl, but behind it all, she is very kind, generous and empathetic. Her feet are firmly on the ground, but she knows the direction she wants to go in. “In music, you can find big personalities that are dficult, but Brooke is not like that at all. If you come to her with something that needs changed, she will take criticism and work it to her advantage. “She can take the positive and the negative, and thats important in the music game she wants to go into.” Brookeas part of her school choir.

Newbridge man Jonny made it through to the final two and a showdown with Londons Blessing Chipata, whose version of Robbie Williams Angels was enough to tip the public vote in her favour. Brooke Scullion had just missed out on a place in the final two, but the Bellaghy woman had the honour of opening the show, and did so in style with a version of Stevie Nicks Edge of Seventeen.  It came after she had emphasised the importance of her familys support after receiving a video call from grannies Peggy and Sheila during the week. googletag.cmd.push Its so important to have your family around you, she told viewers on ITV. Gettinga piece of home from across the water just means the world. I really hope I make my granny proud tonight. Coach Meghan Trainor praised her performance. I love it. Oh my goodness. I was screaming the whole time, she said, appearing again remotely via video link. You hit every note. Ive never been more proud in my entire le. You look amazing, you killed it.  The Bellaghy natives second performance saw her join English singer Ella Eyre on stage, with Meghan Trainor unable to duet with Brooke due to Covid- regulations. googletag.cmd.push The pair performed a rendition of Giant by Rag and Bone Man and Calvin Harris, prompting the London-based musician to say she had been honoured to share the stage with the Derry girl. Newbridges Jonny Brooks wowed the virtual audience with Harry Styles Falling for what he dubbed the most important performance of his le beforehand. My family are happy now to see me doing what I love, he said. Its been a long road but Im more ready now than Ive ever been. Its going to be the most important performance of my le.  Coach Tom Jones praised his performance as wonderful, while rival coach Olly Murs recalled how Tom beat off his advances to secure the County Derry man.     Jonny, the one that got away, he said. I remember me and Tom battling for you. He gave me the Tom Jones eyes. It was a match made in heaven, youve just gone up a level every week. Jonny had a duet with Tom Jones in his mind from the moment he turned his chair, and the pair did not disappoint, performing a version of Uncle Krackers Drt Away. There was heartbreak for Brooke as the final two contestants were announced, but joy for Jonny as he moved into a final pairing with Londons Blessing Chipata. I dont know what to say. Thank you so much for your comment. I know Ive come out of this so much better and Im happy with how tonight went, said a gracious Brooke after the vote results were announced.  Newbridge native Jonny then performed a version of Natalie Imbruglias Torn in the final sing-off, but in a dramatic finale, Blessing Chipata took the honours. Jonny was gracious in defeat and said it had been quite a ride. Its been a journey for me, but Ive learned so much, made so many friends. This is exactly what I needed to do, he told viewers at the end of the show. It has been quite a journey too for all in County Derry, who have backed both their singers all the way to the final stages of the competition, and will follow both their careers with interest.

Neil McCafferty was admitted to the local hospital last month. After contracting Covid-, the -year-olds condition deteriorated rapidly and his family said it would take a miracle for him to survive. However, Neils family, his we Bridie and five children, were told today that he is being discharged from the intensive care unit to a ward where he will continue his recovery. He has also got the all-clear from Covid and has come off all required support. googletag.cmd.push Neils son, Michael, said they were told at one stage that he was critically ill and was not likely to pull through. Since that our dad has progressed positively and responded to the tremendous support he received from the amazing staff in ICU, he said. We as a family would like to express our sincere thanks to the overwhelming support, we have received from my mum and dads family friends and from the amazing people of Derry and beyond. We have overcome many ups and downs over the past six weeks in terms of the impact that Covid has had on our family. googletag.cmd.push We would also like to express our condolences for the families who have lost loved ones during this very dficult time and offer our prayers and support for those families with loved ones currently battling this terrible illness. We hope that our dads situation may offer hope to those who are currently suffering the impact of this terrible virus. Michael described the staff who have cared for his father as amazing. We thank you for the personal care and encouragement you displayed to him and us as a family over the past number of weeks. These medical staff are worth more than their weight in gold and should be commended for their bravery and respect shown to the patients and their families during this dficult time.     He said they had received a huge amount of support in recent weeks. We would also like to thank everyone who sent messages from all over the world with well wishes for our dad who made many friends during his work le in England, China, Bangladesh and America. To the people who did not even know him and prayed for his well being we thank you as well. We have been overwhelmed by the people of Derry who again I will say are the most amazing people on this planet. Finally, a very special thanks to Sr Clare Crockett who we feel has been a source of support spiritually through this dficult time. Michael added: Our dad has a long way to go with rehabilitation, but we seem to have time on our hands now and with the tremendous support from medical staff we hope that his recover maybe swt.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Caral Niacute Chuiliacuten, who visited a number of local community projects before the coronavirus outbreak, will speak with representatives from Derrys four Neighbourhood Renewal Areas - Outer North, Outer West, Waterside and Triax - as well as community and voluntary workers from Strabane. The meeting, which has been organised by Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan, will take place over Zoom video conferencing due to the current Covid- restrictions. Ms Mullan, who was a community worker for  years, said a review of pay and conditions within the sector was long overdue. googletag.cmd.push Speaking to the Derry News, she said: Staff havent had an uplt, never mind a pay increase since . People dont realise it because the people who carry out community work are used to fighting for everybody , but not for themselves. Thats just the kind of people they are. They will be putting it to the Minister for Communities that they have not had a pay increment or even a proposal around a pay increase in over  years. For this reason, they will be asking her to conduct a review into staff salaries and conditions. Most staff in this sector only get statutory sick pay and maternity pay unless they are lucky enough to work for an organisation that has some reserves in place to cover that. googletag.cmd.push Ms Mullan said the meeting would also be a chance to highlight the need for community services in the Skeoge area which will soon have , new houses and be home to , new people. Skeoge is home to a lot of young families and therefore a lot of children and young people, she said. We need to see increased community infrastructure there. The people who live there have told me they dont want to be left like Galliagh who had to wait for  years to get it. Ms Mullan said it was hoped Minister Niacute Chuiliacuten will also provide feedback on a government working group which was established to look at its anti poverty strategy.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The measures agreed by ministers include: - Closure of all non-essential retail - Closure of close contact services such as hair and beauty salons and driving instructors exemptions for those in film and TV production, those involved in health and social care services and elite sport services - Hospitality will only be permitted to offer takeaway services - food and drink in motorway services, airports and harbour terminals remain open - Closure of all leisure and entertainment to include soft play areas, gyms and swimming pools - Sporting events only permitted at elite level and to be played without spectators - Closure of places of worship with exceptions for weddings, civil partnerships and funerals - the maximum number present will remain at  - It is understood that close contact services and coffee shops that are due to reopen on Friday can still do so - but only for one week. - Off licences will be allowed to remain open, but will have to close at pm - No household gatherings of more than one household, other than current bubbling arrangements, will be permitted with exceptions for caring, maintenance, house moves. - Schools and childcare will remain open.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We are in a bad economic climate at the minute with Covid and I donrsquot believe itrsquos value for money.Downpatrick councillor John Trainor asked Mr Tamati for figures on the actual usage of the facility and this was promised by the end of the meeting.Slieve Croob councillor Andrew McMurray highlighted a continued need for people to enjoy outdoor exercise during the pandemic and it was incumbent on the council to provide it.Mr Tamati agreed with several councillors that there may be additional funding open to the council to pay for the work and he would investigate.Slieve Croob councillor Hugh Gallagher described the proposed spend as a ldquopositive investment and admitted the facility ldquowas closed more than it was open due to maintenance issues.However, he added: ldquoItrsquos vitally important to support this.Mournes councillor and committee chairwoman Leeanne McEvoy said that the facility required the investment now and added: ldquoChildren use it rain, hail or snow.The motion was proposed by Cllr Mark Gibbons and seconded by Cllr Hugh Gallagher.Mr Tamati said that ongoing structural steelwork issues with an overhanging part of the roof of the auditorium at the Newcastle Centre represented a health and safety concern.He revealed a structural assessment report by engineers had identied ldquosignicant concerns relating to the structural integrity of the steelwork given the localised environment of the Newcastle Centre.He asked committee members for approval for the immediate erection of scaffolding to the extension at an estimated cost of pound, per annum along with the appointment of consultants to look at ways of additional support of the structure at an estimated costs of pound,.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason said the proposal highlighted the need for new leisure facilities for Newcastle while Cllr Trainor sought confirmation that the problem did not concern all of the centrersquos roof.The motion was proposed by Cllr Charlie Casey and seconded by Cllr Gallagher.Mr Tamati asked the committee to consider the ldquourgent removal of the upper side viewing rsquo of the outdoor swimming facility, the Rock Pool.He also asked for approval for the appointment of specialist consultants to carry out further ldquoinvasive and exploratory works, including core drilling, to establish whether any further upgrade works were required.He talked at the extra care needed as the Rock Pool had been designated as a historic monument.Cllr Hugh Gallagher proposed the expenditure and Cllr Karen McKevitt seconded.The motions are to go before the next full council meeting to be rubber-stamped.Speaking after the meeting, Cllr Laura Devlin, and council chairperson, said: ldquoI thank Hugh for proposing that council moves ahead with these much-needed surveys. The Rock Pool is deeply rooted in the Newcastle community and is a very important part of our history.

Year.Stormont roads minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that within weeks she will make a so-called direction order which is expected to outline when contractors could be on site to deliver the near two-mile scheme.Major progress has been made over recent years to advance the scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads with the bypass designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district with suggestions that it will take at least  months to construct, with roads officials insisting that the scheme will reduce journey times and improve road safety.Last June, the roads minister included the Ballynahinch bypass in a list of strategic projects expected to progress during the current financial year, with the local scheme mdash which could cost up to poundm mdash effectively ready to proceed.South Down MLA Emma Rogan has welcomed the ministerrsquos commitment to finally make a decision in the New Year when work on the bypass will start.She said while local Sinn Feacutein representatives have been lobbying the minister since she came into post to sign off on the strategic roads project, she had not fully committed to the much-needed roads scheme.ldquoHaving campaigned for this infrastructural improvement since the

rsquoshovel-readyrsquo project there had been growing anxiety and frustration locally that the Minister had not moved swtly to announce the start of the scheme.The Assemblywoman said the bypass will greatly improve transport connectivity in the local community and wider South Down area.ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the successful delivery of this project will also help improve both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community in these dficult times, she said.A spokesman for the Department of infrastructure said the roads minister announced in June her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of strategic road improvement schemes, including the Ballynahinch bypass as part of her plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.ldquoThe Ballynahinch bypass scheme is now at an advanced stage of development and preparatory work on contract documentation has been completed, he confirmed.ldquoThe Minister has asked officials to complete the work necessary to allow her to make the Direction Order. This includes a review of the environmental reports which is nearing completion and, subject to the outcome of the review, she hopes to be in position to make the Direction Order for the scheme in the new year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th November 2020 BBC.jpg","title":"BBC chatshow duo inspire Alex and Eve  ","story":"MOVE over Alex Jones and Matt Baker mdash therersquos a new presenting duo in town.Ten year-olds Alex Carson and Eve Wilkins are setting their sights as future broadcasters after presenting a promotional video on their school, Killinchy Primary School.The confident youngsters won the prime presenting spot to help tell prospective parents all about the ethos of the school ahead of new admissions opening later this month.Principal Chris Currie is delighted that the video has gone down so well on social media and how his school is shown through the eyes of his two engaging pupils.ldquoWe realised that there wouldnrsquot be an open day this year due to Covid virus, explained Mr Currie. ldquoI began to think of a video as I had done some promotional ones for my previous school and as the pupils always show parents their school during open day, I thought that they should take the lead and present the video.ldquoI thought that it would be good to have a pair of students presenting it in The One Show fashion and thatrsquos what we aimed for.In truly inclusive style, Mr Currie opened up auditions for whatever pairs of boys and girls who were interested with over  children being whittled down to six pairs who went through to the casting video.He said that what set Alex and Eve apart was their interaction with each other as they are both great friends.ldquoAll the pairs were very good and could have easily have done a great job but because Alex and Eve were naturally good friends, they bounced off each other and I knew they would be great, he said.ldquoThis was really about having some fun doing this and we all did, added Mr Currie who filmed and edited the  minute video.Alex, who is from Lisbane, and Eve, who is from Killinchy, both enjoy attending dance, drama and singing classes at the weekend and are confident in their presenting roles.They worked alongside their principal in writing the , often making their own suggestions for the video.Part of their technique was to to interview parents and their own principal in between showing off their school.Eve said: ldquoWe wanted to show how we play and decided to put on a dance and a football outfit but we thought it would be betterAlex put on the dress and I was in the football outfit.Alex said that both he and Eve would be thinking of television in their futures and one of the best things about doing it was getting out of class..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2020 Committee.jpg","title":"Committee set up for women – ‘step for proper change’  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is to set up a new dedicated womenrsquos committee.There was across-the-board political support for a motion calling for the new group to be established to discuss and promote womenrsquos issues at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.The motion was tabled by Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason and her Slieve Gullion counterpart, Oonagh Magennis, with the aim of building the skills and confidence of female representatives and to promote women getting involved in local politics to aim to achieve proportionality.The politicians say while the new informal group will comprise women councillors, the local authorityrsquos male representatives will be encouraged to attend and become champions on womenrsquos issues.Cllr Mason said the new group will engage with the council and other organisations and focus on training, education and confidence building opportunities, alongside networking and expertise and empowering each other, both inside the debating chamber and within the community they represent.She said any working group should be non-restrictive and encompass all parties to be able to engage with particularly, but not solely, female leadership figures within the councilrsquos ranks and beyond.Cllr Mason said that just over one quarter of councillors across the provincersquos  district councils are female which is well below the European average of %, despite more than half of the population being female.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down is ranked eighth out of  councils in terms of percentages of female representatives, while the Causeway Coast and Glens Council has % female representation in its debating, she continued.Cllr Mason said just  of the local councilrsquos  elected representatives were women,  of whom were formally elected with one co-opted. The previous council had nine female councillors and while pleased that the number has increased, the Slieve Croob politician said a lot of work still needs to be done.ldquoWhen I look around the debating chamber I note that there are no female party group leaders, she continued. ldquoSome political parties have a very small number of female representatives, while others have none. I do believe that these parties have got some very tough questions to ask themselves about what they are doing to address this.ldquoWe do, however, have an opportunity to now tackle this head on. We have a female chief executive, female chairwoman of council and several female committee chairs, giving us a fantastic  to address this shameful representation issue.Cllr Mason said reports from around the world indicated that when women step forward to claim their right to participate in politics, they are met by a backlash that encompasses harassment and abuse, both online and offline, with many local cases publicised recently.She said such widespread attacks against politically active women were a clear indicator of the ldquonegative impact of unequal gender norms on the democratic health of societies.ldquoOver the past century, signicant progress has been made in womenrsquos numerical representation in politics around the world. But, all too often, this has not directly translated into greater political influence. Political equality remains a distant goal, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoEfforts to improve female representation in politics have often focused on quotas and reserved shares. What is really needed is a nuanced approach that tackles the underlying, interconnected barriers that women face in getting nominated for elected office, conducting successful campaigns and becoming effective, respected political representatives.Cllr Mason said only one of the  candidates in the Downpatrick electoral area at the last council election was a woman, arguing ldquothis is not good enough and that the question that has to be asked is why are women not putting themselves forward. More importantly, she said something has to be done about it.ldquoSome social scientists cite traditional family arrangements that limit womenrsquos career choices, while researchers at the Brookings Institution have found what might be called an lsquoambition gaprsquo generally within the population with women underestimating their abilities and chances for success, she continued. ldquoIt makes them generally less likely than men to even consider seeking public office, or to have political professionals encourage them to run. This needs to change.Cllr Mason askedNewry, Mourne and Down Council has considered that it has working mothers who are councillors and that when timetabling meetings, is this taken this into consideration, suggesting that her female colleagues would agree that they have to juggle numerous tasks at work, home and within family le in order to attend a council meeting.ldquoResearch suggests that lack of confidence and self-assurance are key issues for women in political le or those with an interest in entering political le, preventing many from entering the male dominated sphere of politics. We must provide a vehicle to change this, she declared.ldquoTraining and mentoring programmes which focus on helping women attain the knowledge, skills and confidence to stand for election and become effective and respected representatives once elected have been identied as one potential way to break down some of the barriers for political representatives and potential candidates.Cllr Mason asked how many times female councillors have sat in meetings with officials from ious agencies and organisations who have directed their attention to the male members.ldquoThis has happened me and no doubt many of my female colleagues many many times. Some of these gender norms are unconscious and entirely unintended, however, we have a duty to identy and challenge these at every opportunity, the Slieve Croob councillor declared.ldquoI am a mother, we and relatively new elected representative aged  and am determined to make political le and indeed linked community and civic le more accessible and equitable for fellow women.ldquoI do not accept the unequal gender norms or the lack of confidence that many women within every walk of le, including ours, suffer or the unequal political influence that exists. I will not accept the fact that female representatives are faced with more harassment and abuse than our male counterparts and am determined to do something about it.Cllr Mason said she was pleased to table a motion that will bring together representatives from all parties to look specically at these issues and indeed many others to educate and empower. She said the new group may be able to reach out to other organisations, sectors, young women and girls and local government employees.ldquoWe may be able to harness experience and expertise to share experience, skills and find a way to tackle some of the serious issues impacting women in our society in political le and outside it, she said.ldquoThe current pandemic has undoubtedly exacerbated this issue, with a recent article citing that womenrsquos jobs are almost . times more vulnerable to the crisis than menrsquos. Women make up % of the global employment but account for % of the overall job losses.ldquoThe main reason for this is that the virus is signicantly increasing the burden of unpaid care which is disproportionately carried out by women who are more vulnerable to Covid- related economic effects because of the existing gender inequalities.Cllr Mason also pointed to the approach of female world leaders in dealing with the pandemic to see the effectiveness of women in politics.She said from Germany to New Zealand, Taiwan to Norway, women stepped up to show the world how to deal with the crisis, with research indicating that countries led by women had ldquosystematically and signicantly better Covid- outcomes.The Slieve Croob councillor added: ldquoLetrsquos look towards Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand as an example. It has been suggested that her down to earth and almost lsquomother-likersquo approach has attributed to her success, not only in handling this crisis, but leading to her winning a landslide election only a few weeks ago.

Just three minutes later, the helter-skelter start continued with a second goal of the match mdash but unfortunately for the Mournemen, this one went the way of Offaly. Shane Kinsella got on the end of a flowing move on a wet pitch and delivered an unerring finish beyond Keith.McCrickard floated over his second point of the first half when he soloed away from his marker and delivered a floated finish high over the bar.The scoring abated for the next few minutes, before Sands showed great strength and panache on the ball, before firing high over the bar to make it a level game on  minutes.Down did move ahead just before the first water break when Oisin McManus found the target from a . Cahill took his chance from a th-minute free to level things up once more, and just  seconds later Shane Kinsella pointed to put the visitors ahead by one.Down refused to let them move clear though and on  minutes, McManus delivered another free to make it - apiece.Down broke on Offaly in a flowing attack, which yielded a th minute free, McManus continuing his unerring vision in the first half with a well-landed score.Down made the error of conceding another free just seconds later and Cahill did not need any encouragement given the eye he showed from a placed ball in the first half, once more dispatching the score confidently.On  minutes, Cahill again profited from the placed ball, firing over the bar of Keith to leave the Mournemen trailing by a point by - to -.Daithi Sands popped up with a very welcome score for the Red and Blacks to equalise. A minute before the end of normal time in the first half, McManus landed another free to put Down in front.However Peter Geraghty kept Offaly very firmly interested in the contest when he pulled the sides level again.Cahill was still devilish in his torment of Down before the interval when he supplied his fth point of the half to make it - to - in the visitorsrsquo favour at the turn-around.After the restart, Down came out fired up, looking to wipe out Offalyrsquos advantage. They did that when Oisin McManusrsquo free made it - each.Cahill soon responded in kind however as his diminutive movement continued to prove a thorn in Downrsquos side, scoring his sixth minor.Six minutes after the restart, Kinsella gave Offaly a two-point cushion when he smashed over an effort to bring his overall personal tally for the afternoon to -.Down then had Lady Luck smile upon them. Offaly were awarded a penalty, but Eoghan Cahillrsquos effort came back off the post.There was some controversy however as the Offaly players argued with the official that the ball had actually gone into the net and thumped off the stanchion in the goal. However no goal was awarded, as Offaly continued to lead - to -.In the nd minute, Cahill landed another free to open Offalyrsquos advantage back up to three points. McCrickard and his opponent David King quickly swapped points, before Cahill again showed great composure to allow Offaly to keep Down at armrsquos . McManus scored again to make three between the sides, - to - at the next water break.After play resumed, Down were ready to give it one last big push. Quickly after the action started again, Donal Hughes scored two minors to leave just a point in it at - to -.With nine minutes left to play though Cillian Keely nudged Offaly two ahead again. Substitute Paul Sheehanrsquos nd minute free once more kept Down on their coat-tails.With five minutes of time to play, Sands popped up again to make it a level match. It ensured a grandstand finish to the game.Cahill had the chance to put Offaly one ahead from a free which was a huge way out. However he managed to split the posts, to the delight of the visitors.Down werenrsquot done and Barry Trainor landed a score following an adventurous run forward to make it - each and force extra time.In the first period of extra-time, Offaly were out of the blocks quickest as first Keely, and then Geraghty knocked over scores to open up a two-point gap and leave the Mourne county on the back foot.Substitute Sheehan led Downrsquos response and he immediately brought the gap back to one.Conor Woods kept Downrsquos momentum motoring when he levelled the scores up, before Offaly took a grip again with an Adrian Hynes score six minutes into the extra-time period to make it - to -.Sheehan then scored a free just before the end of the first period of extra-time to level once more.Hynes fired over ten minutes into the period to give Offaly a lead at half-time of extra-time. Down then produced a key moment in this monumental tussle when Daithi Sands found the back of the net to catch Offaly cold at the resumption.Offaly were stunned, but picked themselves back up off the floor, Adrian Treacy scoring from a free. Sheehan extended the gap to two. Liam Langton then scored two points though to make it level-pegging once more. The whistle blew, and this contest would be decided on penalties.Offaly scored their first effort to make it -. Both sides then missed their next spot-kick as the nerves of what was at stake after a marathon battle got to both.Offaly scored their second from four efforts, but Down were once again thwarted from the spot as the tie began to slip away from them in heartbreaking fashion.Down did make it back to - with their next two. Down then scored their final spot-kick to seal victory in a remarkable clash.Down will now take on Kildare at Croke Park on Sunday at  orsquoclock in the final, after they defeated Roscommon convincingly - to - in Saturdayrsquos other semi-final.Down: S Keith , T Murray, C Taggart, M Hughes, B Trainor, C Woods , L Savage, M Conlan, J McManus, D Hughes , P McCrickard , T Prenter, O McManus , E Sands , D Sands .

They come up with routes that are off the beaten track, or stage distances that would not normally be undertaken.The premise of this latest venture was to commit to completing the  miles that would take you from top to toe of Irelandyou were running it in the real world, aka The Malin To Mizen Virtual Challenge.With a nine-week window to finish, Kevin and Clare decided that this was a doable plan.The dedicated duo have stuck to this commitment by logging all their runs in order to calculate how far they would have travelled had they applied those miles to a physical map of Ireland.When they told me one weekend that they were ldquoin Donegal, I was a little confused as with lockdown restrictions this was not likely.When I realised that it was all in their minds, I could see how this visualisation was an inspiring way to liven up running the same old roads close to home.This week they told me that they had ldquoreached Co Limerick and in fact were about to enter Co Cork. They had a spring in their step as the end was in sight.They decided to spread the requisite miles over the full nine weeks and still have until December  to reach the end.Kevin has done all his miles by running, while Clare has adopted a multi-discipline approach with a mixture of running, swimming and dog walking.While in reality they never left Co Down, in their imagination they have crossed the counties of Donegal, Derry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cavan, Leitrim, Longford, Westmeath, Offaly, Tipperary, Limerick with Cork the final piece in the geographical jigsaw.They admitted that on some dark, wet and windy mornings, they questioned their enthusiasm, but they found that getting in the miles early in the day was the way to go.The longest leg undertaken in one session was  miles.There was disappointment for them as well as other club members when the Tollymore Half Full and Ultra Marathon had to be called off at the weekend.Even though the forecast was grim, many were keen to get out and put their training to good use. Having been deprived of the chance to clock the . miles in company, they will have to play catch up this week.When asked how important it was to have a goal at this time, Clare said: ldquoThis time last year, we were in Las Vegas to complete the Rock N Roll Marathon, but this year we have gone to another extreme and have had to travel virtually rather than take a plane.ldquoWe found the challenge gave us a reason to run as with no specic events to train for itrsquos dficult to maintain motivation.ldquoNeither of us are keen on virtual races, but this challenge is a little bit dferent. I liked the flexibility to add in other activities as well as running.If you think that they will be ready for a rest when they reach their virtual destination, you would be wrong. They have already signed up to a Lands End to John OrsquoGroats Challenge.This was casually mentioned in passing by one of their club mates and so they decided that running theof Great Britain would be a good sequel.If you fancy a more local scenario, The Mourne Mountain Seven Sevens Challenge goes on sale on November . The brief includes a stirring quote by Sir Edmund Hillary - ldquoIt is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves.Rather than covering a set distance, the object is to meet the target of , feet of elevation or climbing. You can do this as a team or an inidual.You can run, walk, crawl be that on your stairs at home, a local hill or in the mountains. From December , you have  weeks to accumulate the elevation by recording any activity no matter how small or large until you meet the goal.The reward is a rather splendid bespoke metal buckle depicting the seven mountains in the Mournes. Details can be found by searching The Inspirational Runners Podcast on Facebook.Provided restrictions ease as planned later this week, there will be also be some live racing in the near future.For those who like running long miles in alternative locations, there are still entries for the Montalto -Hour Challenge which takes place this Saturday, November  at the Montalto Estate, Spa, outside Ballynahinch.On Saturday, November , it is back to the Down Royal for K K with shorter distances for Juniors. Entries must be made online.

He has argued that the resortrsquos harbour area has been neglected at Christmas.Across the district, there will be articial Christmas trees erected by the local authority in Downpatrick and Newcastle, while a sustainable Christmas tree will be erected in Ballynahinch.The tree that will be erected in the market town is one of  which have been sourced from local forests, while  sustainable trees that will be erected in a number of towns and villages have been purchases from a nursery in Italy.Ten of these trees will replace those planted in previous years which have not survived, while councillors hoped to be told last night how the local authority is going to organise ceremonies to switch on tree lights and other festive illuminations across the district given the current coronavirus restrictions.Members of the Neighbourhood Services Committee have also been told that a contractor has been appointed to erect, test and repair festive lighting displays across the district and will also be responsible for taking them down in the New Year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2020 Plan.jpg","title":"Plan to develop Dunleath Park into sports hub  ","story":"LOCAL politicians are to be asked to weigh in with their support to develop Downpatrickrsquos Dunleath Park as a centre of sporting excellence to cater for a range of sports.They are keen for a new G pitch to be at the heart of a Newry, Mourne and Down Council investment proposal alongside a so-called bubble to allow outdoor tennis to continue in all weathers and the provision of a new walking path.Dunleath Park has been at the heart of local sport for many decades catering for soccer, gaelic football and hockey, but little cash has been spent on it, apart from annual maintenance costs.This week, local politicians from the Lecale SDLP group have called for the park mdash which is adjacent to Downpatrickrsquos poundm ultra-modern leisure centre mdash to be developed as a centre of sporting excellence, insisting that the work is carried out by the local authority as a priority.South Down MLA, Colin McGrath, said the playing fields at Dunleath Park had been unable to fulfil their full potential over the past number of years.He said given the potential of the many sports pitches contained within the park, it would be ldquoincredibly short sighted not to try and develop them.ldquoI am delighted to that my party colleague, John Trainor, has submitted a motion at next monthrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, to provide a G pitch, a so-called covered bubble to host tennis, a walking path and more, said Mr McGrath.He added: ldquoThis is the first step in what I hope will be an incredibly exciting journey for Dunleath Park. I look forward to seeing this project develop andanyone has any thoughts or ideas as part of this discussion I would be keen to hear from them.Describing the facility as an ldquountapped resource, Cllr Trainor said Dunleath Park is perfectly sited as it sits beside the townrsquos ultra-modern leisure centre and busy main route.ldquoWhen you visit the park itrsquos incredible the amount of people that you will encounter either just out for a walk, walking their dog, playing a game of football and more, said Cllr Trainor.He added: ldquoNot to attempt to develop Dunleath Park in some way for all the people of Lecale would indeed be short sighted and look forward to submitting my motion to the council Council and the debate and discussion it will undoubtedly create.Major new leisure provision has recently been provided across the council area including Downpatrick, Saintfield and Newry, with plans in the pipeline for signicant investment in new leisure services in Newcastle.The call to develop Dunleath Park as a centre of sporting excellence comes after the local council was last week asked to signicantly improve leisure provision in Ballynahinch.Rowallane councillors want the organisation to address under investment in the market town and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities is a critical component of the councilrsquos future investment plans.The need for ultra-modern leisure provision topped the agenda during a recent online meeting between local politicians and senior council officials, with the need for all options to be on the table moving forward.Council officials have been asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.Politicians say while Ballynahinch has missed out on major local authority investment over recent years, the organisation needs to address this now to cater for the needs of local people and sporting organisations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2020 Residents.jpg","title":"Residents’ group seek to close ‘rough’ outdoor drinking den  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK residentsrsquo group is seeking help in its bid to close down an outdoor drinking den in the town.The Steam Street Residentsrsquo Association wants to fence off an area surrounding a NIE sub-station close to Dunleath Park.The association says the area has become a magnet for teenage drinkers and anti-social behaviour.The association is being supported by councillor Cadogan Enright and also says the police are backing the move.Residentsrsquo group chairperson John Gordon says the area around the sub-station has been an anti-social hot spot for many years and had resulted in assaults on local residents and windows being broken in houses.Mr Gordon called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council, which owns the land, to take action.ldquoIt is council land and we are expecting the council and the Downpatrick Policing Partnership to show the same efficiency as the Housing Executive did last year in solving a very similar problem, he remarked.Committee member Peter Smith said: ldquoThis situation has been going on too long. There was a time that the council had this fenced off years ago, but it was a weak fence and little deterrent to vandalism and intrusion.ldquoWe need the Downpatrick Policing Partnership to step up here and work with the council to solve this problem.Councillor Enright said a move last year to fence off a nearby area, which was also an anti-social behaviour hot spot, had proved successful.ldquoWe had a huge success when we got PSNI support for fencing off a particularly bad anti-social and rough drinking hot spot near the Scout Hall, he said.ldquoIt had been the source of several assaults on local residents and attacks on property by the same group of older teens. These people are well known to the local community and the PSNI.ldquoWith support from the Housing Executive we had the area fenced off. I got the residentsrsquo association funding for  trees and we planted the whole area up. We have had no trouble since.Councillor Enright said the sub-station was broken into and used a store for drink, which he arranged for the police to confiscate.ldquoStream Street Residents Association has the support of the PSNI in seeking to have this small area fenced off with access only for NIE Networks in the same way the area on the other side of the garages is fenced off for NI Water, he remarked.ldquoClosing off rough drinking and anti-social hot spots like this is definitely part of the solution to driving this sort of behaviour off our streets.He added: ldquoWe are looking for an on-site meeting with the policing partnership and the council as this situation should have been sorted out last year when the Housing Executive stepped up and helped us with the problem near the Scout Hall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2020 Workers.jpg","title":"Workers to go on strike  ","story":"WORKERS at Newry, Mourne and Down Council are set to take industrial action in early December.Trade union members voted overwhelmingly last week to take action over inequalities of pay and terms and conditions.Officials of GMB, NIPSA, SIPTU and UNITE were unable to say yesterday what date action would start and what form it would be as they still need to give council officials seven daysrsquo notice.However, relations between the unions and management have further soured with alleged complaints that the council moved last week to remove protected voluntary severance payments without trade union consultation.The dispute has been running for over two years and stems from when the former Down District and Newry and Mourne councils were merged under reorganisation in .Unions claim that the promised harmonisation between the terms and conditions of workers from the two councils was never fully introduced and inequalities remained.A union spokesperson said: ldquoCouncil workers are aware that Covid- has made  a really hard year for the community in Newry, Mourne and Down. It is with regret that we are being forced to take this action in order to improve our pay and protect our terms and conditions.ldquoAlthough there will be limited action in December, our members will be escalating the disputethe issues are not resolved, in January, . It is in the managementrsquos hands to resolve this dispute.He said that the four trade unions were united in their action and urged council management to address membersrsquo ldquolegitimate grievances and avoid an entirely unnecessary industrial dispute.ldquoWe are calling on local elected representatives to intervene and ensure that we avoid huge disruption in the midst of a pandemic.Hundreds of workers were balloted on the options on taking strike action and action short of strike action over the last few weeks.The spokesperson said: ldquoSince the ballots opened, council bosses have openly sought to remove TUPE protected voluntary severance entitlements and this has only further galvanised the determination of the workers to defend themselves.He said that the council was the only local authority left in Northern Ireland which had not resolved the pay dferences and terms and conditions disparities arising from amalgamation.He explained that aside for some refuse collectors in the legacy Newry and Mourne Council being paid pound, more that their legacy Down fellow workers, there was dfering severance terms for workers.While former Newry and Mourne workers had a voluntary severance agreement that would have offered them a . week multiplier payment for every year worked, the legacy Down council employees had a basic severance policy.A proposal to the Strategy, Policy and Resources committee last week, discussed privately without the public present, was approved by councillors which offered a general maximum . multiplier for both voluntary and compulsorily severance packages.Trade unions claim that certain workers could lose up to pound, in severance under the new terms.NISPA regional organiser Kevin Kelly said: ldquoManagement did not negotiate with us about this rate. They just came up with it and expected everyone to accept it.ldquoBut there is a certain route and negotiations that have to be gone through in order to change a personrsquos contract but the council seem willing to just impose this.A council spokesperson said yesterday that work was continuing with the trade unions to reach agreement on agreeing further terms and conditions.ldquoaking into account the impact of Covid-, the council has been considering the implementation of a voluntary severance scheme which would offer a generous redundancy package well above statutory redundancy pay, the spokesperson said.ldquoAlong with an enhanced redundancy payment, those employees aged over  but below normal retirement age will also receive their remaining pension benefitsthey are accepted for voluntary redundancy.ldquoAt the same time, the council has a responsibility to spend public money in the most responsible manner possible, particularly in the wake of the Covid- pandemic when public finances are stretched, and the private sector is contracting and experiencing signicant unemployment.The spokesperson said as ldquoas custodians of public funding but also employers the councilrsquos focus was on providing a comfortable retirement for employees whilst at the same time being ldquocognisant of the rights of rate payers, many of whom are experiencing financial hardship and are not entitled to such generous redundancy packages.He added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down District Council is committed to transparency and fairness to everyone employed by the organisation as well as delivering on our commitment to provide value for money for all our residents and ratepayers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9653973.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The R rate has unfortunately not dropped as far, or for as long, as had been estimated. We have taken some time today to look at the reasons for this. Sadly it is clear that a careless minority have signicantly undermined the sacrices of the many.ldquoSo I want to take this opportunity to say to those who feel itrsquos acceptable to flout public health advice, think again.ldquoWe all need to work together to save our hospitals, to save Christmas, to save lives.Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill said: ldquoThe Executive has given detailed consideration to the evidence in front of us and listened very carefully to the medical and scientic advice on the progression of the epidemic. It paints a stark picture of the situation we are facing into.ldquoSeventy six people have lost their lives to Covid- in the last week alone. Hospital occupancy currently stands at %. Our hospitals remain under extreme pressure, as do the staff we depend on to deliver care. To do nothing would inevitably lead to the entire system becoming completely overwhelmed.ldquoThis has informed our agreement to introduce enhanced restrictions for a period of two weeks from next Friday,  November. The modelling indicated that this will be most effective in reducing virus transmission and offered a greater likelihood of avoiding further restrictions before Christmas.ldquoWe know this will be dficult for people to hear, but this is a necessary intervention to protect our health service. And it will give us the best possible chance of getting to the other side of the Christmas period. Our actions as we approach Christmas are crucial.Health Minister Robin Swann said:ldquoI want to thank my fellow Executive Ministers for supporting the recommendations I brought to todayrsquos meeting. This virus has tested us all across society in ways we have never been tested before. Nowhere has the pressure been more severe than in our health and social care system.ldquoWithout this further intervention, there was a very real risk of our hospitals being overwhelmed in the run up to Christmas. Care for Covid and non-Covid patients would have been in severe jeopardy.

Other zoos including in London are undre great pressure tooFor instance Professor Christopher Dickman of the University of Sydney says that , animals have been destroyed recently in Australia and that it is a sad time for native species, many of which can’t be found anywhere . This relentless destruction brings into sharp focus the global destruction and extinction of wild animals. It is clear that there is a great urgency in taking positive steps to protect and conserve what’s left of the planet’s animal ersity. This urgency was recognised and acted upon by the Irish government appointed committee to advise on the Dublin Zoo in its comprehensive report published July .    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...\"Letter to the editorThe zoo was in imminent danger of closing in the late s. To advise the government in dealing with this crisis a committee was established by cabinet, consisting of Mr Michael Doyle , Mr Nicholas Jackson, Mr George Eaton and Mr Noel Pearson, to examine the structure of Dublin Zoo and come up with recommendations. I was appointed secretary to the committee in . The terms of reference were broad and open-ended. Our  page report was presented to government in July . We consulted a wide spectrum of zoological and marketing experts, including Dr M R Brambell Director North of England Zoological Society, Mr A G Greenwood, Yorkshire, Mr J J C Mallison, Jersey Zoo, Mr N L Jackson, Zoological Society of Wales and Mr Phelim McCloskey, Mosney Holiday Centre. These experts were helpful and generous with their time and professional advice. We commissioned market research on public attitudes to Dublin Zoo and we examined submissions from iniduals and institutions, including the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, University College Dublin, Maynooth College and Trinity College. Some conclusions that we came to are that there is a compelling need for developed countries to play their part in the education of their populations towards the wildle of their country and the world and the need to involve their populations in the conservation of species which have lost their ability to survive in the wild. The market research brought to light interesting results, apeswere the favourite animals, % followed by elephants,%. There were preferential dferences between men and women: females preferred Peacocks, %, compared to % for males.All the inidual zoo animal facilities were examined. Regarding the Orang-Utans the committee made a stand for female animal equality. It was noted that the large adult male would sit at the only entrance between the inside enclosure and outside viewing area, preventing two adult female Orang-Utans from going to and fro. We recommended a second entrance which solved the problem of accessibility. To broaden the conservation work of the Zoo, Dr Christopher Moriarty wrote a paper on the possibility of including a world class aquarium. The committee saw no reason why the Dublin Zoo, following restructuring and with state support, should not play a full role within the European zoo community. The national survey by Lansdowne Market Research showed that the Irish public were overwhelmingly in favour of the retention of the Zoo and most Irish people accepted that zoos are necessary to preserve rare types of animals.Our final conclusion was that a new zoo structured on modern lines was vital for Ireland and which would play its part in the global zoological strategy for the survival of many endangered species. We ended our summary with a quote from Baba Dioum, Senegal, “In the end we will conserve only what we love, We will love only what we understand, And we will understand only what we are taught”.It seems that the Dublin Zoo is again facing the prospect of closure. Over the summer, Sir David Attenborough has expressed concern that London and Whipsnade zoos will close.If these zoos close, it could have a knock-on effect on the Belfast Zoo Micheal O’Cathail, Fermanagh——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

He was very much connected to the area having married Jane Stradling, a daughter of Sir Edward Stradling of St Donats Castle, Glamorgan.ldquoSir John did what was expected of him - convictions and a sentence designed to ensure real suffering as a part of the execution.Guy Fawkes, however, had other ideas.ldquoGuy Fawkes was a brave, experienced soldier, added Cllr Clarke. ldquoHe did not fancy lsquohanging aroundrsquo to witness his emasculation and disembowelment before dying.ldquoHe knew he was going to die, but he had just one way open to him to cheat the sentence to some extent.ldquoHe will have been drawn to the execution site, probably having been tied to a wooden frame.ldquoOn his arrival at the scaffold, on climbing to the ropes, he threw himself off the scaffold in such a way that he would land and break his neck.ldquoHe was dead before being hanged and did not wait to witness the truly painful additional, gruesome punishment.ldquoIt was the only way he had to defeat the horror of the sentence that Sir John Popham was obliged to order.ldquoAll body parts will have been par-boiled and added to poles to be exhibited around London to warn off others.This type of execution stood the test of time until  when the punishment was limited to hanging with the option for the monarch to replace the hanging with beheading.Beheading was eventually banned in  with the death penalty for treason abolished in . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They claim that important historical heritage could be lostthe plan to build houses goes ahead.Cosmeston Farmhouse. Picture: Alex SeabrookThe plans could also mean demolishing the farmhouse and barn at Lower Cosmeston Farm which are still in use by the current residents. Jonathan Lambert said the farmhouse is  years old, while the barn dates back to the late th century.He said: ldquoI had a hunch there was something in the area and in the very first trench I found a lot.ldquoThe farmhouse is one of the oldest buildings in Penarth.The archaeologists are set to apply to Cadw, the Welsh Governmentrsquos historic environment service, for the farmhouse and barn to be listed and the medieval remains scheduled mdash legally protecting the area and its archaeological heritage.The plans have also drawn criticism from residents living nearby, who are concerned about the impact on the local environment and already-stretched local infrastructure.Campaigners are objecting to the plans because of the loss of countryside but also because they say the pandemic makes it harder for people to have their say in the planning process.Archaeology trench dug up at CosmestonMichael Garland, chair of Keep Cosmeston Green, said: ldquoWe canrsquot deliver leaflets, we canrsquot talk to people on the street, we canrsquot have a proper discussion about it.

You canrsquot visit the planning department to see the plans, because you canrsquot travel and the offices are closed anyway.There are restrictions on how you can see the plans and comment on them.ldquoThis land has been farmland for centuries, and itrsquos just going to be lost.

It will now be for the Vale of Glamorgan council to consider the planning application and any representations made.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoThe council is currently considering a planning application from Welsh Government relating to this matter. The plans can be viewed through the online planning register on the councilrsquos website and comments are invited from any interested party.ldquoPlanning officers are available to discuss the proposals with members of the public throughout the normal working week by email, telephone or virtual meetingnecessary.ldquoViews can be submitted by emailing planning@valeofglamorgan.gov.uk and all will be considered as part of the normal planning process.

Edna Leon, from Wrexham served as a chef, keeping the war effort goingWalford Hughes, from Aberystwyth, served in the Far East campaign and supported the Burma Star Association long after his service and Gordon Prime from Pembroke Dock, was a motorcycle dispatch rider.They are the epitome of lsquoservice not selfrsquo.Today is an opportunity to reflect on the contribution our Armed Forces continue to make.During this pandemic, many have used their skills and expertise to support our NHS and local services. Serving personnel have driven ambulances and delivered PPE, built field hospitals and supported paramedics ndash we are indebted to them and all our critical workers for helping to Keep Wales Safe.Other servicemen and women have been deployed overseas ndash as they are every year ndash supporting communities in peacekeeping roles or providing security and training.Service le means families can be separated for long periods of time.This year especially, that will have caused added worry and stress as the world lives under the strains of coronavirus. Today we stand with them, too.At a time when everyone in Wales is being asked to make sacrices, we remember the generations before us who made their sacrices for us to live our lives the way we do today.We also remember their dedication to the collective cause.These are dficult times for us all.

Ken Miles to ldquospeak to the minute, when he indulged in an outburst against the recently announced Government proposals.ldquoWe on the side of the Chamber are justiably concerned at the savage cuts on housing subsidies, he was saying when the Mayor intervened.As recently reported in the Barry and District News, the Land Commission was seeking to purchase the land until the Government announced its intention to dissolve the commission.In a report to the council the Town Clerksaid the Lands Sub-Committee had recently reviewed the situation and an approach had been made to the owners, the Wenvoe Estate, with a view to the council acquiring the land.The Glamorgan County Council had expressed an interest in certain land for playing field purposes and this land had been excluded from the sale.At the present time it was still not known whether the figure proposed by the District Valuer was acceptable to the estate, and in view of this the necessary steps were being taken to prepare a compulsory purchase order.The land was suitable for comprehensive development when the necessary drainage schemes had been completed.ldquoIf the land in question is not acquired by the corporation then for control over its future development reliance would have to be basically placed on planning control exercised by either this authority or by the County Planning Authority, and the Town Clerk.ldquoIf the land were to be split up into smaller parcels it may be dficult ndash and our previous experience supports this view ndash to maintain effective control over the developments of the area as a whole.Coun. E. G. Hellstrom, chairman of the Finance Committee and the Lands Sub-Committee, who moved that compulsory powers be sought, said the land was ideal for development and the Land Commission had wished to share out the land in a satisfactory way so that it would be developed privately in the way the Government wished.The present Government also wished development to go ahead and they could develop the land attractively for private housing.The surrounding properties were of fairly high value and he thought such development would tend to raise the value of those houses, not lower them.The development was conditional upon completion of the Western Drainage Scheme.Coun. Hellstrom said it was not certain at this stage whether the council would sell the freehold.Ald. Williams said he felt sure that when compulsory purchase order was made these smallholders would name some approach to the council. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I run in this area and there is signicant wildle here. Also, every year there is always some flooding on Lavernock Road when a quick heavy downfall happens. If the green pastures canrsquot contain the rainfall, more concrete isnrsquot going to make it any better.Mr Wilson added: ldquoWe support new house building and recognise a need for social housing, but we wanted to make sure we were engaging with our community and finding a balance. This also has a direct impact on me because my house backs onto Lavernock Road.ldquoWe fully support the petition to fight the development and I am encouraging people to sign it. Our major concerns are that this has not been properly thought through.While the public consultation on the plans has now ended, the Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos planning committee will soon consider whether to grant permission, during a public meeting. A date for that meeting has not yet been set.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesmansaid: ldquoThe council is currently considering a planning application from Welsh Government relating to this matter.

They still want to drink and see their friends. Now, because the pubs are closed, there is nowhere regulated for them to go - so they just go to house parties.”There have been reports a number of shebeens or illegal pubs with patrons paying for drinks.\"Willard D Barber. General Manager of McConvilles and Ma Berrys in Portadown. Photos Courtesy of ‘Lockdown Diaries’ by Sasha Treanor.Mr Barber said he is certain no official bars are opening illegally because the implications for anyone in the licensing trade is far too great.“It doesn’t surprise me that there are people out there who are setting up illegal shebeens. That’s because pubs are closed and there is no regulation on people doing that from home. Obviously it is illegal,” said Mr Barber.He said it was reminiscent of the days of Prohibition and Speakeasies in s America.“It’s a bit like that now with people going to houses and inviting their friends round. I don’t knowthey are charging orthere is a ‘secret box’,” he said.He called on the bars to reopen: “I think it is very unfair that pubs had to close. It also further proves that actually the pubs weren’t the cause of the issues. “I think it is time that everyone got back to school and back to work. I don’t think closing schools or pubs is really helpful. It’s not fair to blame pubs and close contact services when actually, since they have been closed, the numbers have increased.”Hair salon owner writes to First and Deputy First Minister after five weeks with no income Read the story hereThank you for reading this article.
