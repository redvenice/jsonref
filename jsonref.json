The new farm can produce between eight to 10 tonnes of veggies dailyGood news for Chinese daigous: Coles increases its purchase...Boy, 13, has a phone cable stuck and tangled in his penis...Heroic Chinese pensioner, 60, climbs out of a third-floor...Why ARE we paying his wages? Muslim Labor MP claims \u0027the...Share this articleThe massive incubation room requires only four staff members to manage - compared with about 300 farmers required in conventional farmlands to produce the equivalent amount. People in China consume an average of 276 grams (9.7 ounces) of vegetables every day, according to the National Institute for Nutrition and Health. \u0027Compared with our first generation smart farm, this new plant yields even more effective results while reducing labour and environmental costs,\u0027 Sanan Sino-Science CEO Zhan Zhuo told MailOnline. The company was founded in 2015 by San\u0027an Group and the Chinese Academy of Sciences\u0027 Institute of Botany.Its first generation plant factory, which covers an area of 10,000 square metres (1 hectare), is claimed to be the world\u0027s largest vertical farming complex. The smart farming method, which practises growing vegetables and herbs in multilevel cultivation beds of hydroponic solutions in a controlled environment, is equipped with highly advanced autonomous technology.           The smaller-sized varieties can be harvested in 18 days while larger vegetables take between 33 and 35 days          An automated converter belt was also seen transporting the plates of crisp green veggies for packaging          Scientists donning a full biohazard gear with goggles, faces masks, rubber gloves and boots while examining the veggiesThe confined indoor space has a strict system that regulates temperature, water source, humidity, nutrients and LEDs that replace sunlight. \u0027This maximises the plant\u0027s growth potential while maintaining a sustainable and continuous growth cycle,\u0027 Mr Zhan said. In the factory, the smaller-sized varieties can be harvested in 18 days while larger vegetables take between 33 and 35 days, he added. Vegetables in a conventional farm need about 40 to 60 days to reach maturity, which is also highly dependable on weather conditions.At full capacity, when the energy cost is neglected, the smart factory can produce 3,000 tonnes to 3,500 tonnes of leafy greens per year.  Video footage of the gigantic smart plant shows factory workers donning a full biohazard gear with goggles, faces masks, rubber gloves and boots while examining and patrolling rows of rainbow coloured LED-lit shelves. Various plants including lettuce, basil and bok choy are seen growing on large white trays in tiny allocated slots, submerged in nutrient solutions that are essentially free of soil.            Sanan Sino-Science\u0027s first generation plant factory is claimed to be the world\u0027s largest vertical farming complex          These vegetables taste less bitter and possess higher nutritional value compared with other conventionally grown plants          The incubation room requires only four staff members, compared with about 300 farmers required in conventional farmlandsAn automated converter belt was also seen transporting the plates of crisp green veggies for packaging.   \u0027These vegetables taste less bitter and possess higher nutritional value compared with other conventionally grown plants,\u0027 Mr Zhan said.More importantly, the new technology greatly saves on water, which is a scarce resource in the country.\u0027We are working hard to attain a 1:1 ratio between the water used and the vegetables harvested,\u0027 Mr Zhan said, meaning that one tonne of water used can ideally produce one whole tonne of vegetables.\u0027Currently, 80 per cent to 85 per cent of the water used could be recycled back into the plant. We hope to reach the 1:1 ratio goal by 2020.\u0027 The company also plans to install AI technology in the facility that can record and analyse growth data through sensors. The self-learning model will automatically design a template that illustrates the optimal growing condition for each specific kind of vegetable, Mr Zhan said.This will also help the farm produce a precise, stable, year-round supply of leafy greens, which means that market prices vegetables could also be more predictable.           More importantly, the new technology greatly saves on water, which is a scarce resource in the country          The smart, GMO-free veggies are sold around 30 yuan (£3.4) to 36 (£4) yuan per kilogramme in China\u0027This farming method is particularly beneficial in challenging environments such as deserts, mountainside towns, or in cities where labour come at a high cost,\u0027 Mr Zhan said. A tightly controlled environment not only speeds up the growth cycle, but also allows researchers to create vegetables  that suit specific needs, he added.For example, scientists can lower the amount of potassium in the greens for patients with kidney problems or increase zinc in cabbages for children.Right now, the vegetables produced are being shipped to the rest of Fujian province and Shanghai in supermarkets and high-class restaurants.The brand new technology could help transform China\u0027s rapid green revolution amid growing concerns on food safety and nutrition.The country is also the largest producer of vegetables in the world, harvesting 78.7 million tonnes of vegetables in 2016. The number is expected to rise continuously, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.            The farm can produce a precise, stable, year-round supply of leafy greens, meaning market prices will be more predictable          Through the system, scientists can lower the amount of potassium in the vegetables for patients with kidney problems The smart, GMO-free veggies are sold around 30 yuan (£3.4) to 36 (£4) yuan per kilogramme in China, while regular vegetables are sold at a wholesale price of 2.85 yuan (£0.32) per kg, according to the latest statistics released by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.While this may be an eye-watering price tag to many, a recent food and health survey conducted recently by China Youth Daily on 2,001 Chinese residents shows that more than 76 per cent of participants are willing to spend more money on healthier food choices.Another 66 per cent of those surveyed agreed that they would now pay more attention to the product\u0027s nutritional value than its flavour and taste.The smart factory\u0027s relevant equipment and technologies have been shared with countries possessing advanced technological capabilities such as US, Japan and Singapore, Mr Zhan said.\u0027We hope to bring the concept of produce locally, sold locally to different cities,\u0027 he said. \u0027We have ambitious plans to expand.\u0027¿ Top producers of fresh vegetables worldwide 2016 | Statistic"},{"url":null,"title":"National Lottery results Lotto draw Wednesday 4th July","story":"Pornhub has UK drill videos on its site despite campaign to remove themAnt-Man and the Wasp star Evangeline Lilly had retired from acting before The HobbitThe Bachelorette finale: All you need to know about the season 14 finalePamplona bull run 2018: All you need to know about San Fermin\u0027s Running of the Bulls festivalITV to launch Absolutely Ascot in bid to rival Made in ChelseaThe rules Meghan Markle has to follow but Princess Eugenie and Beatrice don\u0027t revealedLondon Pride 2018: Starbucks to celebrate with Glitter FrappuccinosPaul McCartney tour: Freshen Up UK tour dates, tickets and venuesTour de France 2018: All you need to know about the 105th editionNational Lottery results: Lotto draw for Wednesday, 4th JulyWorld Cup 2018: Bank of Russia jokes it predicted Russia\u0026#8217s victory over Spain on special currencyCalum Best calls for Love Island bosses to have more focus on mental health supportEngland vs Sweden football history revealed ahead of 2018 World Cup fixture on SaturdayPrince Louis christening: Who will Kate Middleton and Prince William invite?EuroMillions results: National lottery winning numbers for Tuesday, 3rd July 2018 drawWhen Kate Middleton will next wear a tiara revealed"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/05/11/4DF087BA00000578-5920583-On_Monday_the_women_confronted_the_man_together_and_filed_a_poli-a-3_1530787280412.jpg","title":"Man confronted three girlfriends hes dating time","story":"    The women tackled the love cheat after he tried to make a run for it during the confrontation          On Monday, the women confronted the man together and filed a police report in Nanning cityWoman runs herself over after accidentally putting her car...The last revenge: Crab pinches woman on the LIP right before...Share this articleVideo footage of the ugly confrontation shows the three upset women yelling at the love cheat.\u0027Why did you do this?

The Beckham franchise, when it gets going, will also bring a training center and an academy focused on developing local players to the Miami area.The stadium-location quest is just the latest drawn-out chapter in Beckham\u0027s five-years-and-counting marathon to bring MLS back to Miami. The Miami Fusion played from 1998-2001, folding because of poor attendance.Beckham and MLS announced in January that the franchise would be coming to Miami, but nearly every detail about the club remains unclear. There\u0027s no definitive start date - 2020 has been mentioned repeatedly, even though no new stadium could possibly be ready by then - as well as no team name, no logo, no colors, no coaching staff and no front-office personnel.More than a year ago, Miami-Dade County commissioners approved a deal to sell Beckham nearly three acres of county land for $9 million with the belief that it would be the last parcel he needed for a stadium site in the city\u0027s Overtown neighborhood. But that site was never the preferred choice for Beckham and his group anyway, with the original hope being to build on the waterfront near the Port of Miami.The Overtown site now seems all but doomed, though it\u0027s unclear what would happen if city commissioners or voters block the latest Beckham plan.          Beckham preferred a site near the Port of Miami, but traffic from the port\u0027s bridge and from American Airlines Arena - the home of the Miami Heat - made the intersection unusable    In this January 29, 2018, file photo, David Beckham speaks at an event where it was announced that Major League Soccer is bringing an expansion team to Miami.

Lest we forget: Jewish diarist Anne Frank, pictured in 1940, went into hiding with her family in Amsterdam in 1942, and died in a German Nazi concentration camp three years later, after they were discovered and deportedHowever, he also mentioned that \u0027all the papers have been destroyed there\u0027, because on May 14, 1940, while the Frank family was still on a waiting list for possible visas, the American consulate was devastated during German bombardment and all papers were lost.Even without the loss of their visa application, it would have been difficult for the Franks to immigrate to the United States.With hundreds of thousands of people seeking refuge in the US each year by the time war broke out in 1939, Washington was issuing fewer than 30,000 annual visas.The processing of a visa application also lasted several years and included a huge amount of paper work, and affidavits from relatives or friends in the US.Even with all these demands fulfilled, applicants could still be turned down.The new research focused on the paper trail, looking at documents such as the affidavits of support, testimonies on character and other such items provided to the US authorities in the screening process, in addition to items such as birth certificates, wedding certificates, tax clearances and more.The war further complicated any immigration efforts.          Efforts: Otto Frank, pictured with Anne in 1941, is thought to have tried twice to apply for U.S. visas and once to Cuba but was \u0027thwarted by American bureaucracy, war and time\u0027A renewed attempt in 1941 to get the family to the US failed because all American consulates in Germany-occupied Europe, including the Netherlands, were closed by the Nazis.A visa application to Cuba that same year also never came through.While the Franks were not explicitly denied visas by the American consulate, \u0027their efforts were thwarted by American bureaucracy, war and time\u0027, the historians wrote.\u0027All their attempts failed, so going into hiding was their last attempt trying to get out of the hands of the Nazis,\u0027 said Annemarie Bekker, from the Anne Frank House.The family hid for more than two years during the war and it was then that Anne wrote her famous diary.On August 4, 1944, they were discovered and ultimately deported to Auschwitz. Only Anne\u0027s father survived the war. Anne, who was 15, and her sister died in the Bergen-Belsen camp.After the war, Mr Frank had his daughter\u0027s diary published, and it went on to become a symbol of hope and resilience that has been translated into dozens of languages.The house where the Franks hid was turned into a museum that is one of Amsterdam\u0027s most popular tourist attractions."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/08/4DF7E3E300000578-0-image-m-6_1530863024875.jpg","title":"Grandfather 81 performs BACKFLIP pool two years going viral trick","story":"    Getting ready!

So it is one-zero for us then.\u0027We do have caviar, but I am pretty sure they can manage without caviar and it will be a good game. Otherwise they are welcome to visit us. It will be a fantastic match between two great teams.\u0027He added: \u0027We had Netherlands and France in our (qualifying) group and we beat Italy in a play off. We beat Portugal last year in a friendly.

But we go in to the quarter final in a very good mood.\u0027  The Swedish delegation have been privately meeting human and civil rights leaders in Russia and supporting their work. Mr Sjostrand added: \u0027 England have so many good players and they should beat us. But it would be so boring if life was always like that.\u0027He said the Swedish fans would support England if Sweden is knocked out and added: \u0027Harry Kane is a fantastic player and we follow the Premier League in Sweden.    Despite Sweden claiming victory in the battle of the hotels, Gareth Southgate\u0027s men will be hoping for a repeat of their heroics when they beat Colombia on Tuesday (pictured)\u0027I am a Manchester United supporter and one of my daughters is called Ester because of Manchester.\u0027 I also follow Ashley Young , Rashford and Lingard. England have so many good players.He said he expected between 1000 and1500 fans to be in the Samara Arena on Saturday evening to be supporting Sweden.He added \u0027To come here is a challenge because of a lack of flights and it is really expensive.\u0027We had 500-6000 people at our last match because it was in St Petersburg and it not so difficult to travel from Sweden. People came by car and by train through Finland.\u0027We hope for a great match and of course a Swedish victory.

We believe it to be one of his earlier watercolours.\u0027          Libby Sheldon, pictured, agrees the painting is a genuine TurnerMs Archer-Thompson revealed that cross-border cooperation had resulted in the lost Turner coming to light.She said: \u0027The private collector of the lost Turner watercolour is English.We met him through a Scottish connection, who is another art collector.\u0027\u0027I first saw the painting in March at the collector\u0027s private residence.\u0027He bought the painting a few years ago but has been researching it because he wanted to find out more as he thought there was something special about it.\u0027I knew it was a genuine Turner. I was completely moved when I held it in my hands. It is something to hold it in your hand rather than behind a glass, which is great about my job. This is probably the highlight of my career.\u0027The private collector paid peanuts for it - a two-figure sum - only for a national gem to be discovered.\u0027Extensive archival research was undertaken to build up a case for why this was a genuine Turner painting from his life and time at Abbotsford.Her role was using her expert knowledge in the subject to help the owner unravel the story behind the painting of Scott\u0027s home. Combining that with the scientific study of the painting has enabled Ms Archer-Thompson to make the case.Ms Archer-Thompson is convinced it is a Turner because a pencil sketch, which can only be seen by infra-red imaging reveals the artist\u0027s original sketch. This has been adapated and changed siginficantly in the paint.The type of paper used for the watercolour also matches Turner\u0027s use of materials but the main focus was on the date of the frame and the paint.The scene of the Tuner painting is also found in the engraved commemorative book after Scott\u0027s death.Ms Archer-Thompson added: \u0027Not very long ago another lost Turner watercolour appeared and was sold for £230,000.\u0027The tiny watercolour, which is poket sized, measures at 5.5 inches by 3.5 inches.Libby Sheldon, a painting analyst expert, \u0027supports the theory\u0027 the Turner is a genuine.Ms Archer-Thompson, added: \u0027All of this analysis, including work by painting expert Libby Sheldon, demonstrates that it was executed by an astonishingly skilled hand.\u0027          The painting is believed to have been painted at the Scottish home of Sir Walter Scott, picturedWhen Turner stayed at Scott\u0027s house in August 1831, the writer showed the renowned painter his art collection, amongst which is believed to be a view of Abbotsford and the River Tweed by Scottish artist Elizabeth Nasmyth.Ms Archer-Thompson said: \u0027This painting is from exactly the same vantage point we believe Turner painted.\u0027Scott had a personal attachment to the Nasmyth painting and its composition and my theory is that this gave Turner the idea to compose the same scene, which he based on sketches in the Abbotsford sketchbook used during his visit in 1831.\u0027Abbotsford House Trust chairman James Holloway, a former director of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, added: \u0027It is wonderful for Abbotsford to be able to show such a fascinating painting.\u0027It will intrigue and delight our visitors.

Players, such as Dele Alli, have models as girlfriends — in his case one who specialises in lingerie.These are lifestyles and behaviour utterly alien to the wives of 1966.The Football Association even excluded them from the victory champagne reception at London’s Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington. Instead, the wives — and one fiancee — dined separately in the chop house upstairs. Their husbands came up to collect them at around midnight.Kathleen Peters, the wife of midfielder Martin Peters, said: ‘We were overwhelmed and just sat in the hotel room, staring at his medal like two kids. We didn’t even drink champagne — I think I made us a cup of tea.’One wife was absent, Jack Charlton’s wife Pat, who — now 83 — likes to joke that she is the ‘oldest WAG in the world’.She watched the World Cup Final on a black-and-white TV in her modest semi-detached house in Leeds with her mother. ‘Of course we were very proud of them, but we were not involved like the wives and girlfriends are these days at all,’ she says.          WAGs on a night out in St Petersburg. From left: Millie Savage, Gemma Acton, Megan Davison, Becky Vardy, Annabel Peyton, Fern Hawkins, Shannon Horlock, Annie Kilner and Lucia LoiLike current England captain Harry Kane’s fiancee, Katie Goodland, Pat was pregnant and opted to stay at home for medical reasons. ‘I watched it at home because I was about to have a baby. I already had two children.‘I wanted to go to the final, but the medical advice was against it and you don’t want to go into labour in the middle of the World Cup Final at Wembley.’She adds: ‘I know that some of the girls were upset because after the final they could not sit with the husbands but had to go into another room for dinner. They felt it was not right, stuck in a different room, like you are nothing. But that was the way it was.’Pat, married to Jack for 60 years, remembers he rang her about an hour after the match, and came home the next day — stopping at a transport cafe for a plate of egg and chips.The separations while the tournament was on were hard, she said. ‘They would go off for two or three weeks before the World Cup and you wouldn’t see them.’But that was the way England manager Alf Ramsey insisted that it should be. He didn’t want his players to have any contact with their wives — they were allowed phone calls and letters only.Patricia Hunt, who was orced from Roger in 1981, explains: ‘We had a very different relationship with the management. They kept the wives and families at a distance. We were definitely not involved or invited. Our role was not even considered.’She seems astonished that one of this year’s players, Fabian Delph, returned from Russia to the UK to be with his wife for the birth of their third child.‘If that had happened in Alf Ramsey’s day, he would have said: ‘‘Go home...and don’t come back after.’’ It would not even have been considered a possibility.          Roger Hunt and wife Patricia pictured a few weeks after England\u0027s triumph in the 1966 final‘Football is not just a game any more,’ says Pat. ‘The money they earn, the cars they drive, the mansions they live in and the lifestyles they lead are totally different from the way it was for us.’This much is true — the England team were paid a tiny fraction of current wages.Martin Peters earned around £120 a week at Tottenham (the equivalent of £1,770). Harry Kane, who plays for the same club, is on £200,000 a week.Pat Hunt says: ‘We were ordinary people. Your husband was playing a game of football, but it was no big fuss made. I would have hated to have been looked at and analysed and watched as the WAGs are, but now it’s all big money and celebrity.‘Rebekah Vardy flies out with all the family on a private jet, then she’s on the telly on Loose Women and is out until 3am or 4am, and it’s all about publicity.‘I suppose they do it and absolutely love it, and good luck to them, if they can handle it.’Tina Moore, married to 1966 England captain Bobby until 1986, agrees. ‘We didn’t have anything like their money, but we did have a wonderful life. Would I like to be a WAG today? I don’t know, to be honest. My husband was handsome and charismatic, but you never had too much concern (about predatory female rivals).‘Nowadays it’s horrendous — women pursue footballers because they know that they could end up with a great lifestyle. I wish them luck with it.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/22/4DFC4C5100000578-0-image-m-24_1530912356885.jpg","title":"Harry Kane vows make nation proud","story":"    Captain Kane pledged to make the nation proud as England take on Sweden at the World Cup          Harry Kane told fans today that he hopes his team will provide more jubilation this afternoon   England\u0027s tournament run in Russia has sparked scenes of wild celebration back at homeEngland’s tournament run in Russia has sparked scenes of wild celebration back home and Kane, 24, hopes the team will provide another cause for jubilation by reaching their first World Cup semi-final for 28 years.Kane said: ‘After the games we always see the videos on social media.

I don’t mind either way. Obviously I am a tennis player, so I am here to do my job first.‘Hopefully it will be a success for both of us, England and myself.’One solution would be to start Edmund’s match at 5.30pm, by which time the England game should be over even if it goes to penalties.Many wedding parties are also anxiously wondering whether they will be able to see the match.

We can’t wait.’Al Pimblett, 35, and Lindy Fountain, 30, from Taunton in Somerset, will not be having a big screen at their wedding, which takes place at 2.30pm, but the groom has worked out a strategy.He said: ‘My plan is to quickly say “I do”, she does, couple of pics then jump in the wedding car and try and get the game on the phone!

Useful in politics, that is. He read law at university and became a solicitor. He had a good brain but there was also a hankering for wider acclaim. Humdrum legal work, attending to conveyancing or wills or marital disputes, will not grab headlines the way a big yellow balloon can. Human rights was where the political juice was. The eager Khan was soon developing a speciality in minority-grievance cases.He became a partner in his firm by his mid-30s, dabbled in local politics and increasingly styled himself the representative of high-profile victims of what he might in those days have called ‘the establishment system’. From there, in those days of early Blairism, it was a comparatively easy step to become Labour MP for Tooting in 2005.At first he was impressive: his energy palpable as he caught the Speaker’s eye. His voice had an urgency. He worked his fringe into a little quiff with hair gel. He was a boxy-shouldered, bustling figure and earned some respect for the way he ignored the New Labour Whips and – apparently acting from the highest principles – opposed Tony Blair’s plans to lock up terror suspects for 90 days without charge. He also criticised Blair for the invasion of Iraq.But then ambition again infected his bones. After Gordon Brown replaced Blair as Prime Minister, the Whips sidled up to the man who had so recently rebelled against them.Did he fancy joining their crew? A job in the Government! Mr Khan almost bit their hands off and became a Whip (ie an enforcer among Labour MPs). Soon he was badgering other MPs to vote for detention periods of 42 days without charge. How easily had those once precious principles been blunted.\u0027The biggest insult to a sitting US president ever\u0027: Nigel...Meet the men behind the anti-Trump protests: The wealthy...Share this articleSince then this oddly insubstantial figure has floated upwards – and away from his working-class roots – on a series of felicitous thermals. Most politicians are egomaniacs but this one takes it to new, almost comical extremes (there is a glorious photograph of him striking a butch pose and placing his hand on some railings which had a ‘WET PAINT’ sign on them).Most politicians break or bend their word but this one does it with bells on. Most politicians are opportunists but Sadiq Khan has made short-term posturing so much his speciality, he would win the gold medal for it at any Interstellar Olympics. Take his non-gender-specific traffic lights. When ‘trans rights’ were the big thing a couple of years ago, someone suggested – for all I know in jest – that it was a denial of trans people’s rights that pedestrian signals at road crossings only showed a little green or red man.And so the newly-elected Mayor Khan ordained that such lights, at public cost and to widespread mockery, should be altered so that the signals now show politically-correct diagrams rather than a little chap.Take his indignant demand for a national bank holiday for Prince Harry’s wedding (er, it was held on a Saturday). One day it was a headline, the next day, amid embarrassed coughing, it could be filed under ‘Y’ for ‘yesterday’s news’.Or his feckless declaration that new homes in central London should not be allocated parking spaces because residents should use public transport – the same public transport whose fees he has allowed to rise – and save the planet by reducing their carbon footprint. How were homeowners meant to struggle home with the weekly supermarket shopping?          An inflatable balloon depicting Donald Trump as a baby wearing a nappy, which will fly over London when the President visits on July 13, with one of its creators Leo MurrayMr Khan’s eco-lecturing did not stop him making a much-trumpeted vanity trip to Pakistan and India where one of his great photo-opportunities coincided with a terrible smog in Delhi and he was almost completely invisible posing for photographs in the pea-souper. The trip was depicted as a ‘coming home’ for him, yet when he was asked about that, he said, ‘I’m from London, mate’. Was he playing it both ways, tacking to the minority-ethnic vote while at the same time asserting his London-born credentials? Perish the thought!But that, alas, is the nature of this shallow, self-serving figure, a man many Labour MPs have still not forgiven for encouraging Ed Miliband to stand against his brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010, a disastrous misjudgement which led to the party being taken over by the extremists of Momentum.Mr Khan may not worry much about that. After all, he himself is safely ensconced as London mayor, having beaten a weak challenge from the Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith in 2016. I’m all right Jack!Likewise, he will be thinking himself jolly clever this weekend as the country prepares for Mr Trump’s visit. He has got one over the most powerful man in the world!In London, it is claimed, Donald Trump is widely disliked. He is certainly opposed by the metropolitan elite, who have never forgiven him for beating their heroine Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.You wonder, however, what they think of Trump on those building sites and boxing gyms where the young Sadiq Khan spent his time.I suspect they have a rather higher opinion of the US President as someone who stands up for the working classes and who speaks their language.Trump is certainly a better communicator than arid, charmless Khan. The best political communicators speak from the heart. It is when politicians strike false poses, with words written for them by strategists and advisers, that they fail to convince.And the sorry fact is that since he became London mayor, Mr Khan has struggled to say anything interesting or radical.When the creators of the ‘Baby Trump’ balloon first told London’s City Hall about their stunt, they met with little reaction. But then, suddenly, the project was given the mayor’s blessing.Did Mr Khan’s Press handlers suddenly get wind of the wheeze and spot its potential for a few headlines that might move the public’s attention away from his dreadful record on crime prevention?Mr Khan’s decision to make a political thing of this balloon lark will no doubt win the acclaim of the Twittersphere. But the City of London’s banks and finance houses depend greatly on American custom and goodwill. Donald Trump is a notoriously touchy president. As a nation we need to persuade him to give post-Brexit Britain a trade deal.The balloon stunt will gain Mr Khan oodles of publicity. But what will it do for the reputation of a City, and our country, which needs to earn the goodwill of the White House?Would a serious mayor, a proper, substantial, internationally-minded leader of our capital city, in touch with his real constituents rather than fringe protesters, not have put such considerations above his own childish posturing?As for that Baby Trump inflatable, we must earnestly hope it is not peppered by someone with a long-distance rifle. Pop goes the weasel Khan’s silly stunt. One can but hope.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/07/00/4DF7DA2400000578-0-image-a-16_1530920636540.jpg","title":"Alan Titchmarsh says water companies stop blaming gardeners","story":"    Aerial images highlight the effect the heatwave is having on Britain\u0027s green and pleasant land as the parched earth turns an arid yellow amid scorching temperatures and little rainfall    With the heatwave set to last, suppliers are warning their customers to use less water or face a banBut Titchmarsh, 69, hit out at the warnings, saying that water firms waste so much in leaks themselves.Three billion litres of water simply drains away every day, according to regulator Ofwat. Titchmarsh told Horticulture Week magazine: ‘A hosepipe ban would be galling when so much water is not properly managed and leaks.

More than 80 per cent of homes in Jonkoping, in the province of Smaland, use them.During their dark winters, with snowfall which can last up to eight months, the Swedes become introverted and prone to depression. But come the pagan festival of Midsommar, they decorate maypoles with flowers, party like it’s 1999 and stay up all night before hurling themselves into lakes, rivers, saunas . . . and other people’s beds.Sweden is nearly twice the size of England, has a population of just 9.9 million (compared to our 54 million) and boasts roughly 3.1 billion trees.

It lasted six days. Excitement reached fever pitch as the crew negotiated all 58 locks.They love living the lagom way.

Anyone who fancies a cocktail with a real kick should sample the Swedish Mule — it’s made in a tall glass with 2oz of potato vodka, 4oz of ginger beer, 1oz of fresh lime juice, a dash of sugar syrup and lots of ice.A few of those and you’ll be singing Abba’s The Name Of The Game until the final whistle.The WAGS to watch out forThe Scary One: Shanga Forsberg, aka ‘The Sheriff’, 25, married to winger Emil Forsberg, 26.A former Swedish international footballer, she is Emil’s most brutal critic. ‘The only time I get nervous in football is after I play a bad game as I know what’s coming,’ Emil said.‘The Sheriff always gives it to me straight. “You were a disaster!

Her story came to public attention because she featured in a BBC documentary called Should I Marry My Cousin?, which looked at the custom of cousin marriage.Relationships described as ‘consanguineous’ are those between couples who are at least second cousins or more closely related. The practice has been legal in Britain for more than 400 years, but is considered one of society’s last taboos.In British Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities, marriage between cousins is designed to strengthen the family and keep wealth intact.But there are massive health risks involved for the children of such couples.

Shockingly, cousin marriages are a key factor in an average of two child deaths every week.This figure is derived from the fact that a total of 545 boys or girls born to closely related couples have died in childhood during the past five years, according to the Department for Education, which collates data from Child Death Overview Panels in every council area. (It is the job of these panels to examine the deaths of any child under the age of 18.)Thousands more children of consanguineous marriages survive, but with appalling physical or mental problems. These include blindness, deafness, blood ailments, heart or kidney failure, lung or liver problems and a myriad of often incurable and complex neurological or brain disorders.According to a report for the BBC’s Newsnight, British Pakistanis are 13 times more likely to have children with genetic disorders than the general population.They are responsible for three percent of all births, but produce just under a third of all British children with such health problems.In Birmingham, around one in ten children from first cousin marriages either dies in infancy or develops a serious life-long disability caused by genetic ailments, according to health officials in the city, where half the mothers of Pakistani origin are married to a close relative.Meanwhile, a research document by the NHS-funded Enhanced Genetic Services Project reveals that in Birmingham in 2009-2010, the combined infant stillbirth and death rate ‘definitely or probably’ due to genetic disorders inherited from Pakistani cousin parents was 38 times higher than that among white European babies in the city.The report — one of the most thorough into this health and social problem — says: ‘Almost a third of the affected children die before five years of age.Most of the survivors suffer chronic disability, and they are cared for by their families, posing tremendous emotional and financial strain.’Up in Bradford, where teenager Hiba Maroof lives, doctors and nurses have told me paediatric wards look after numerous children who are unable to speak, and are fed through tubes.

We hope to reach the 1:1 ratio goal by 2020.\u0027 The company also plans to install AI technology in the facility that can record and analyse growth data through sensors. The self-learning model will automatically design a template that illustrates the optimal growing condition for each specific kind of vegetable, Mr Zhan said.This will also help the farm produce a precise, stable, year-round supply of leafy greens, which means that market prices vegetables could also be more predictable.           More importantly, the new technology greatly saves on water, which is a scarce resource in the country          The smart, GMO-free veggies are sold around 30 yuan (£3.4) to 36 (£4) yuan per kilogramme in China\u0027This farming method is particularly beneficial in challenging environments such as deserts, mountainside towns, or in cities where labour come at a high cost,\u0027 Mr Zhan said. A tightly controlled environment not only speeds up the growth cycle, but also allows researchers to create vegetables  that suit specific needs, he added.For example, scientists can lower the amount of potassium in the greens for patients with kidney problems or increase zinc in cabbages for children.Right now, the vegetables produced are being shipped to the rest of Fujian province and Shanghai in supermarkets and high-class restaurants.The brand new technology could help transform China\u0027s rapid green revolution amid growing concerns on food safety and nutrition.The country is also the largest producer of vegetables in the world, harvesting 78.7 million tonnes of vegetables in 2016. The number is expected to rise continuously, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.            The farm can produce a precise, stable, year-round supply of leafy greens, meaning market prices will be more predictable          Through the system, scientists can lower the amount of potassium in the vegetables for patients with kidney problems The smart, GMO-free veggies are sold around 30 yuan (£3.4) to 36 (£4) yuan per kilogramme in China, while regular vegetables are sold at a wholesale price of 2.85 yuan (£0.32) per kg, according to the latest statistics released by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.While this may be an eye-watering price tag to many, a recent food and health survey conducted recently by China Youth Daily on 2,001 Chinese residents shows that more than 76 per cent of participants are willing to spend more money on healthier food choices.Another 66 per cent of those surveyed agreed that they would now pay more attention to the product\u0027s nutritional value than its flavour and taste.The smart factory\u0027s relevant equipment and technologies have been shared with countries possessing advanced technological capabilities such as US, Japan and Singapore, Mr Zhan said.\u0027We hope to bring the concept of produce locally, sold locally to different cities,\u0027 he said. \u0027We have ambitious plans to expand.\u0027¿ Top producers of fresh vegetables worldwide 2016 | Statistic"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/02/16/4DD747BB00000578-0-image-a-42_1530547181795.jpg","title":"Anne Franks family tried flee stopped Americas strict immigration policy","story":"    Fighter: Anne Frank\u0027s father Otto, pictured in 1971, tried twice to apply for visas for the United States, and later also applied for a visa to Cuba, but failed due to restrictive immigration policy and eventually the destruction of their local American consulate in a German bomb attackHowever, the Frank family\u0027s escape efforts were all in vain, and eventually they went into hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam on July 6, 1942 - exactly 76 years ago.\u0027I am forced to look out for emigration and as far as I can see USA is the only country we could go to,\u0027 Mr Frank wrote in English to a friend in the United States in 1941.England´s odyssey to continue in city associated with Soviet...Huge mass grave of more than 100 skeletons in Russia could...Police say woman, 82, found dead in her flat may have fled...Share this articleHis efforts to get the family out of the Netherlands to the US probably started as early as 1938 - a turbulent year in which Nazi Germany annexed Austria and part of Czechoslovakia into the Third Reich.On November 9 that year, Nazis terrorised Jews throughout the country in the violent Kristallnacht pogroms, also known as the Night of Broken Glass.Mr Frank wrote in his 1941 letter to his friend Nathan Straus that he had filed an application at the American consulate in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam in 1938.          Lest we forget: Jewish diarist Anne Frank, pictured in 1940, went into hiding with her family in Amsterdam in 1942, and died in a German Nazi concentration camp three years later, after they were discovered and deportedHowever, he also mentioned that \u0027all the papers have been destroyed there\u0027, because on May 14, 1940, while the Frank family was still on a waiting list for possible visas, the American consulate was devastated during German bombardment and all papers were lost.Even without the loss of their visa application, it would have been difficult for the Franks to immigrate to the United States.With hundreds of thousands of people seeking refuge in the US each year by the time war broke out in 1939, Washington was issuing fewer than 30,000 annual visas.The processing of a visa application also lasted several years and included a huge amount of paper work, and affidavits from relatives or friends in the US.Even with all these demands fulfilled, applicants could still be turned down.The new research focused on the paper trail, looking at documents such as the affidavits of support, testimonies on character and other such items provided to the US authorities in the screening process, in addition to items such as birth certificates, wedding certificates, tax clearances and more.The war further complicated any immigration efforts.

Anne, who was 15, and her sister died in the Bergen-Belsen camp.After the war, Mr Frank had his daughter\u0027s diary published, and it went on to become a symbol of hope and resilience that has been translated into dozens of languages.The house where the Franks hid was turned into a museum that is one of Amsterdam\u0027s most popular tourist attractions."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/08/4DF7E3E300000578-0-image-m-6_1530863024875.jpg","title":"Woman told dying sold prized possessions finds doctor got wrong","story":"    Julie Shann, 55, of Hull, says she was told by doctors she had terminal lung cancer and had \u0027very little\u0027 time left to live\u0027For a month I was made to think that I was dying and had to plan my own funeral - it was absolutely heartbreaking\u0027 said Ms Shann.\u0027I tried to stay strong for my children who were supporting me but also grieving, and gave them a brave face, but behind closed doors I cried and cried.\u0027I cried myself to sleep at night and every time I went to bed, I didn\u0027t know if I would be waking up again the next morning.\u0027It was so horrible to think that every day could have been my last day.\u0027Ms Shann said she had been giving the devastating diagnosis when she visited her GP in January 2015, just two months after suffering a stroke.

We believe it to be one of his earlier watercolours.\u0027          Libby Sheldon, pictured, agrees the painting is a genuine TurnerMs Archer-Thompson revealed that cross-border cooperation had resulted in the lost Turner coming to light.She said: \u0027The private collector of the lost Turner watercolour is English.We met him through a Scottish connection, who is another art collector.\u0027\u0027I first saw the painting in March at the collector\u0027s private residence.\u0027He bought the painting a few years ago but has been researching it because he wanted to find out more as he thought there was something special about it.\u0027I knew it was a genuine Turner. I was completely moved when I held it in my hands. It is something to hold it in your hand rather than behind a glass, which is great about my job. This is probably the highlight of my career.\u0027The private collector paid peanuts for it - a two-figure sum - only for a national gem to be discovered.\u0027Extensive archival research was undertaken to build up a case for why this was a genuine Turner painting from his life and time at Abbotsford.Her role was using her expert knowledge in the subject to help the owner unravel the story behind the painting of Scott\u0027s home. Combining that with the scientific study of the painting has enabled Ms Archer-Thompson to make the case.Ms Archer-Thompson is convinced it is a Turner because a pencil sketch, which can only be seen by infra-red imaging reveals the artist\u0027s original sketch. This has been adapated and changed siginficantly in the paint.The type of paper used for the watercolour also matches Turner\u0027s use of materials but the main focus was on the date of the frame and the paint.The scene of the Tuner painting is also found in the engraved commemorative book after Scott\u0027s death.Ms Archer-Thompson added: \u0027Not very long ago another lost Turner watercolour appeared and was sold for £230,000.\u0027The tiny watercolour, which is poket sized, measures at 5.5 inches by 3.5 inches.Libby Sheldon, a painting analyst expert, \u0027supports the theory\u0027 the Turner is a genuine.Ms Archer-Thompson, added: \u0027All of this analysis, including work by painting expert Libby Sheldon, demonstrates that it was executed by an astonishingly skilled hand.\u0027          The painting is believed to have been painted at the Scottish home of Sir Walter Scott, picturedWhen Turner stayed at Scott\u0027s house in August 1831, the writer showed the renowned painter his art collection, amongst which is believed to be a view of Abbotsford and the River Tweed by Scottish artist Elizabeth Nasmyth.Ms Archer-Thompson said: \u0027This painting is from exactly the same vantage point we believe Turner painted.\u0027Scott had a personal attachment to the Nasmyth painting and its composition and my theory is that this gave Turner the idea to compose the same scene, which he based on sketches in the Abbotsford sketchbook used during his visit in 1831.\u0027Abbotsford House Trust chairman James Holloway, a former director of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, added: \u0027It is wonderful for Abbotsford to be able to show such a fascinating painting.\u0027It will intrigue and delight our visitors.

Then I saw the police jump out and run to the building.‘They split up: some went to the upper road and some took the lower road and some went by the lake. It was getting dark. We were sitting there thinking “Should we be afraid?” — because one of the policemen took his gun out.’Then, leaping from the first-floor balcony, the man attempted to flee, jumping down to the lawn below.Luckily, officers who had been staking out the flat for days were ready and waiting — wrestling him to the ground and securing him with handcuffs.He has been under lock and key ever since. And, if the authorities have their way, he will remain so for some considerable time.Because the smooth-talking ‘business executive’ is none other than Mark Acklom, Britain’s most wanted conman.He’s been on the run for more than four years, having allegedly fleeced orcee Carolyn Woods out of her £850,000 life savings while posing as a wealthy banker and MI6 agent, and is suspected of cheating dozens more by claiming to be a property developer, City broker, lawyer and even a gynaecologist.Cancer-stricken England fan, 63, will be held in Russia for...Tragic Alesha, six, was \u0027raped and murdered before her body...Share this articleHis arrest brings to an end a Europe-wide manhunt for the privately-educated swindler. Acklom, known for his love of fast cars, first-class travel and expensive hotels, is alleged to have used dozens of false identities to stay one step ahead of the authorities.At the weekend, his luck finally ran out after an international operation involving the National Crime Agency, Avon and Somerset Police and the Swiss authorities.Proceedings to extradite him to the UK are now underway and he is expected to face at least 20 charges of fraud and other offences.For his alleged victims, the news, while welcome, is bittersweet. Because it is almost impossible to overestimate the devastation they say Acklom has left in his wake.‘It has been a very long haul and my health has suffered,’ 61-year-old Miss Woods, who lives in Bath, told the Mail this week. ‘It seems every time I try to start afresh, something else happens with him and it brings the whole episode rushing back.’Meanwhile, IT specialist Christopher Frampton, 55, of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, claims his health and marriage collapsed under the strain of being fleeced out of £50,000 when, he says, the conman persuaded him to give up his lucrative corporate job for a business venture that turned out to be a scam.‘It devastated my life so much, I’m having therapy,’ he says. ‘I am cross that Acklom was living in a million-pound property in Switzerland — I lost all the money I’d saved and my family went from living comfortably to living hand-to-mouth.’          Mark Acklom (pictured) with his wife Maria Yolanda Ros Rodriguez at Ascot\u0027s Royal EnclosureEven Acklom’s own family, from whom he has been estranged for years, still bear the scars from his behaviour.His mother, Diana, told us: ‘My marriage broke up over this, and his children by his first wife don’t have anything to do with him.‘If he wanted to really run away, he should have gone to South America, like Ronnie Biggs. But I think he liked to live on the edge — he needed to have a buzz.‘I was speaking to his brother and he said: “How can he live not knowing who would be behind the next knock on the door?’’’And, make no mistake, in recent months the net had been steadily tightening around him.The current manhunt was launched in October 2016 when a European arrest warrant was issued by Avon and Somerset Police, originally focusing on allegations of fraud linked to Ms Woods.She claims that in 2012, Acklom had walked into the boutique where she worked in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and swept her off her feet, saying he was Mark Conway, a Swiss banker.By the end of their year-long ‘romance’, Miss Woods says she had lent him every penny of her £850,000 life savings.The mother-of-two claims that she was financially ruined and on the brink of suicide when Acklom left her.When the warrant was sought, British police believed Acklom was hiding in Spain: he had a Spanish wife, Maria Yolanda Ros Rodriguez, whom he married in 2009 and with whom he had two children.But in May 2017, the hunt switched to Switzerland after he was photographed at a Geneva cafe by one of his alleged victims, who spotted him by chance.When police examined the images, they realised he was drinking coffee with a Spanish fraudster, also then on the run.The café was staked out — but Acklom never returned.Then, earlier this year, he was linked to a flat in a northern suburb of Zurich, from which it was believed he had been setting up various companies in a bid to attract investors.One business claimed to be manufacturing computer chips for black-box data recorders for cars. The company’s website suggested it had customers from the luxury car industry.Its motto is: ‘Being Defeated Is Optional.’At one point, undercover police mounted a surveillance operation on a bank following a tip-off that Acklom was planning to meet staff and business associates there, but he did not show up.At the time, Sky News revealed that Acklom still had a current passport and a Swiss residency permit in the name of Marc Long — one of several aliases he has used. The legitimate documents were obtained in 2014, shortly after Acklom fled Britain and after he had changed his name by deed poll.          As a teenager, his behaviour rapidly deteriorated from difficult to the downright dreadfulWhat we have now established is that for the past year he has been living in a stunning first-floor apartment overlooking Lake Zurich and has continued to have access to considerable sums of money.The apartment he was renting in the town of Wädenswil, 25 miles south of Zurich, would have cost him up to £2,500 a month. The children were being educated at a local private school.‘My first impression of him was that he was someone who didn’t really want to talk to people,’ said one neighbour. ‘I saw the wife and kids on the paddle board but they’d never say hello.’And Acklom himself was seemingly concerned about being recognised. He generally spoke Spanish, had grown shoulder-length hair and a bushy beard and would always wear sunglasses and a baseball cap. He looked very different, say neighbours, from his police ‘Wanted’ picture.His 47-year-old wife, meanwhile, had continued to indulge her life-long love of yoga.Since last August, she had been paying for one-to-one yoga classes, booking five sessions in advance each time. In the holidays, her ‘very sweet’ children accompanied her to the classes.She used the name Maria Longi and paid in cash — the only one of the instructor’s clients to do so.The instructor, who asked not to be named, said Maria claimed her husband managed a project concerning electronic ‘black boxes’ for cars and was ‘in the IT business’. Out of curiosity, she had searched the internet for more information, but found nothing.Although his wife is not believed to be wanted for any crime, sources close to the case have speculated whether the very existence of a wife and children — three extra people for the authorities to try to trace — may ultimately have hastened his downfall.Last autumn, police had specifically appealed for information about his wife and daughters. They said they believed the children would be attending private schools and that his wife was likely to indulge her passion for yoga.They were right on both counts.‘We have an incredibly high success rate in tracking down fugitives from British justice,’ said Ian Cruxton, head of international operations for the National Crime Agency, in the wake of the arrest.‘We do that through a host of techniques, including mobilising the ability of the public to assist us, which is why we publish the identities of these iniduals.’While celebrating the good news, those who know Acklom say they will not be happy until he is back in Britain to face justice.  Proceedings to extradite him  are now underway and he may face at least 20 charges of fraudRaised in Bromley, Kent, Mark Acklom was the eldest of four children born to a City insurance consultant. He was educated at the prestigious Dulwich Preparatory school. He then went on to board at Eastbourne College, an independent boarding and day school in East Sussex.Despite having all the advantages money could buy, from the beginning, he was a troublesome child. His mother, Diana, believes that a difficult birth may have left him with a brain injury that meant he struggled to empathise with others.‘When he was two, I bought our first puppy,’ she recalled. ‘I had just brought her home and she was sitting on the stairs. He went up and just kicked her out the way. That was the first time I thought this was odd. Most children would go up to a puppy and cuddle it.’In a bid to embrace his difference, when her son was seven, Diana placed a sign on his bedroom door reading: ‘Why be normal?’But as a teenager, his behaviour rapidly deteriorated from difficult to the downright dreadful.As an adult, Acklom made plans to become a Catholic priest then just as quickly dropped them.Next, he married a girl he met in a nightclub. His daughter and son were born shortly afterwards. But the relationship didn’t last, and Acklom walked out on his family when the children were young and never saw them again.Soon afterwards he headed to Spain, but later returned to Britain and became the director of a series of short-lived companies.In 2012, he allegedly met Miss Woods, as well as others, including Mr Frampton, and reportedly once even claimed to be a ‘close business associate’ of Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone.While many who met him say they suffered, Acklom and his family continued to live the high-life. Following the events of last weekend, that, however, looks set to change.Two days after his arrest, his wife, who yesterday was still in the lakeside apartment with her children, turned up as usual for her yoga session, telling the instructor that it would have to be her last.‘I don’t have the money to pay for them any more,’ she said.Quite whether she had any idea of her husband’s alleged deceptions remains to be seen. For now at least, it seems, she will no longer be enjoying the fruits of his labours.Additional reporting: Stephanie Condron "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/21/4DFD00EB00000578-0-image-a-2_1530908499120.jpg","title":"Suspended Labour MP caught renting constituency office party colleague","story":"    Labour MP Jared O\u0027Mara, who has spent most of his parliamentary career without his party whip has been reinstated this week after receiving a warning about his conduct          O\u0027Mara, 37, has been renting a constituency office, pictured,  from a Labour Party councillorMr O’Mara, 37, was reinstated by the Labour Party last week after receiving a formal warning.Now it has emerged that his Sheffield office is owned by a company whose sole directors are Abdul Khayum, a Labour councillor in the city, and Mr Khayum’s brother, Dr Amir Afzal, a Sheffield GP.

Players, such as Dele Alli, have models as girlfriends — in his case one who specialises in lingerie.These are lifestyles and behaviour utterly alien to the wives of 1966.The Football Association even excluded them from the victory champagne reception at London’s Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington. Instead, the wives — and one fiancee — dined separately in the chop house upstairs. Their husbands came up to collect them at around midnight.Kathleen Peters, the wife of midfielder Martin Peters, said: ‘We were overwhelmed and just sat in the hotel room, staring at his medal like two kids. We didn’t even drink champagne — I think I made us a cup of tea.’One wife was absent, Jack Charlton’s wife Pat, who — now 83 — likes to joke that she is the ‘oldest WAG in the world’.She watched the World Cup Final on a black-and-white TV in her modest semi-detached house in Leeds with her mother. ‘Of course we were very proud of them, but we were not involved like the wives and girlfriends are these days at all,’ she says.          WAGs on a night out in St Petersburg. From left: Millie Savage, Gemma Acton, Megan Davison, Becky Vardy, Annabel Peyton, Fern Hawkins, Shannon Horlock, Annie Kilner and Lucia LoiLike current England captain Harry Kane’s fiancee, Katie Goodland, Pat was pregnant and opted to stay at home for medical reasons. ‘I watched it at home because I was about to have a baby. I already had two children.‘I wanted to go to the final, but the medical advice was against it and you don’t want to go into labour in the middle of the World Cup Final at Wembley.’She adds: ‘I know that some of the girls were upset because after the final they could not sit with the husbands but had to go into another room for dinner. They felt it was not right, stuck in a different room, like you are nothing. But that was the way it was.’Pat, married to Jack for 60 years, remembers he rang her about an hour after the match, and came home the next day — stopping at a transport cafe for a plate of egg and chips.The separations while the tournament was on were hard, she said. ‘They would go off for two or three weeks before the World Cup and you wouldn’t see them.’But that was the way England manager Alf Ramsey insisted that it should be. He didn’t want his players to have any contact with their wives — they were allowed phone calls and letters only.Patricia Hunt, who was orced from Roger in 1981, explains: ‘We had a very different relationship with the management. They kept the wives and families at a distance. We were definitely not involved or invited. Our role was not even considered.’She seems astonished that one of this year’s players, Fabian Delph, returned from Russia to the UK to be with his wife for the birth of their third child.‘If that had happened in Alf Ramsey’s day, he would have said: ‘‘Go home...and don’t come back after.’’ It would not even have been considered a possibility.          Roger Hunt and wife Patricia pictured a few weeks after England\u0027s triumph in the 1966 final‘Football is not just a game any more,’ says Pat. ‘The money they earn, the cars they drive, the mansions they live in and the lifestyles they lead are totally different from the way it was for us.’This much is true — the England team were paid a tiny fraction of current wages.Martin Peters earned around £120 a week at Tottenham (the equivalent of £1,770). Harry Kane, who plays for the same club, is on £200,000 a week.Pat Hunt says: ‘We were ordinary people. Your husband was playing a game of football, but it was no big fuss made. I would have hated to have been looked at and analysed and watched as the WAGs are, but now it’s all big money and celebrity.‘Rebekah Vardy flies out with all the family on a private jet, then she’s on the telly on Loose Women and is out until 3am or 4am, and it’s all about publicity.‘I suppose they do it and absolutely love it, and good luck to them, if they can handle it.’Tina Moore, married to 1966 England captain Bobby until 1986, agrees. ‘We didn’t have anything like their money, but we did have a wonderful life. Would I like to be a WAG today? I don’t know, to be honest. My husband was handsome and charismatic, but you never had too much concern (about predatory female rivals).‘Nowadays it’s horrendous — women pursue footballers because they know that they could end up with a great lifestyle. I wish them luck with it.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/11/4DF3845F00000578-0-image-a-84_1530874646844.jpg","title":"A shallow gassy opportunist QUENTIN LETTS Sadiq Khan","story":"    London Mayor Sadiq Khan (pictured) and U.S. President Donald Trump have engaged in a long-running war of words over issues such as crime and terrorismHe attended a boxing gym to improve his weedy physique and to learn how to dodge punches. Useful in politics, that is. He read law at university and became a solicitor. He had a good brain but there was also a hankering for wider acclaim. Humdrum legal work, attending to conveyancing or wills or marital disputes, will not grab headlines the way a big yellow balloon can. Human rights was where the political juice was. The eager Khan was soon developing a speciality in minority-grievance cases.He became a partner in his firm by his mid-30s, dabbled in local politics and increasingly styled himself the representative of high-profile victims of what he might in those days have called ‘the establishment system’. From there, in those days of early Blairism, it was a comparatively easy step to become Labour MP for Tooting in 2005.At first he was impressive: his energy palpable as he caught the Speaker’s eye. His voice had an urgency. He worked his fringe into a little quiff with hair gel. He was a boxy-shouldered, bustling figure and earned some respect for the way he ignored the New Labour Whips and – apparently acting from the highest principles – opposed Tony Blair’s plans to lock up terror suspects for 90 days without charge. He also criticised Blair for the invasion of Iraq.But then ambition again infected his bones. After Gordon Brown replaced Blair as Prime Minister, the Whips sidled up to the man who had so recently rebelled against them.Did he fancy joining their crew? A job in the Government! Mr Khan almost bit their hands off and became a Whip (ie an enforcer among Labour MPs). Soon he was badgering other MPs to vote for detention periods of 42 days without charge. How easily had those once precious principles been blunted.\u0027The biggest insult to a sitting US president ever\u0027: Nigel...Meet the men behind the anti-Trump protests: The wealthy...Share this articleSince then this oddly insubstantial figure has floated upwards – and away from his working-class roots – on a series of felicitous thermals. Most politicians are egomaniacs but this one takes it to new, almost comical extremes (there is a glorious photograph of him striking a butch pose and placing his hand on some railings which had a ‘WET PAINT’ sign on them).Most politicians break or bend their word but this one does it with bells on. Most politicians are opportunists but Sadiq Khan has made short-term posturing so much his speciality, he would win the gold medal for it at any Interstellar Olympics. Take his non-gender-specific traffic lights. When ‘trans rights’ were the big thing a couple of years ago, someone suggested – for all I know in jest – that it was a denial of trans people’s rights that pedestrian signals at road crossings only showed a little green or red man.And so the newly-elected Mayor Khan ordained that such lights, at public cost and to widespread mockery, should be altered so that the signals now show politically-correct diagrams rather than a little chap.Take his indignant demand for a national bank holiday for Prince Harry’s wedding (er, it was held on a Saturday). One day it was a headline, the next day, amid embarrassed coughing, it could be filed under ‘Y’ for ‘yesterday’s news’.Or his feckless declaration that new homes in central London should not be allocated parking spaces because residents should use public transport – the same public transport whose fees he has allowed to rise – and save the planet by reducing their carbon footprint. How were homeowners meant to struggle home with the weekly supermarket shopping?          An inflatable balloon depicting Donald Trump as a baby wearing a nappy, which will fly over London when the President visits on July 13, with one of its creators Leo MurrayMr Khan’s eco-lecturing did not stop him making a much-trumpeted vanity trip to Pakistan and India where one of his great photo-opportunities coincided with a terrible smog in Delhi and he was almost completely invisible posing for photographs in the pea-souper. The trip was depicted as a ‘coming home’ for him, yet when he was asked about that, he said, ‘I’m from London, mate’. Was he playing it both ways, tacking to the minority-ethnic vote while at the same time asserting his London-born credentials? Perish the thought!But that, alas, is the nature of this shallow, self-serving figure, a man many Labour MPs have still not forgiven for encouraging Ed Miliband to stand against his brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010, a disastrous misjudgement which led to the party being taken over by the extremists of Momentum.Mr Khan may not worry much about that. After all, he himself is safely ensconced as London mayor, having beaten a weak challenge from the Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith in 2016. I’m all right Jack!Likewise, he will be thinking himself jolly clever this weekend as the country prepares for Mr Trump’s visit. He has got one over the most powerful man in the world!In London, it is claimed, Donald Trump is widely disliked. He is certainly opposed by the metropolitan elite, who have never forgiven him for beating their heroine Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.You wonder, however, what they think of Trump on those building sites and boxing gyms where the young Sadiq Khan spent his time.I suspect they have a rather higher opinion of the US President as someone who stands up for the working classes and who speaks their language.Trump is certainly a better communicator than arid, charmless Khan. The best political communicators speak from the heart. It is when politicians strike false poses, with words written for them by strategists and advisers, that they fail to convince.And the sorry fact is that since he became London mayor, Mr Khan has struggled to say anything interesting or radical.When the creators of the ‘Baby Trump’ balloon first told London’s City Hall about their stunt, they met with little reaction. But then, suddenly, the project was given the mayor’s blessing.Did Mr Khan’s Press handlers suddenly get wind of the wheeze and spot its potential for a few headlines that might move the public’s attention away from his dreadful record on crime prevention?Mr Khan’s decision to make a political thing of this balloon lark will no doubt win the acclaim of the Twittersphere. But the City of London’s banks and finance houses depend greatly on American custom and goodwill. Donald Trump is a notoriously touchy president. As a nation we need to persuade him to give post-Brexit Britain a trade deal.The balloon stunt will gain Mr Khan oodles of publicity. But what will it do for the reputation of a City, and our country, which needs to earn the goodwill of the White House?Would a serious mayor, a proper, substantial, internationally-minded leader of our capital city, in touch with his real constituents rather than fringe protesters, not have put such considerations above his own childish posturing?As for that Baby Trump inflatable, we must earnestly hope it is not peppered by someone with a long-distance rifle. Pop goes the weasel Khan’s silly stunt. One can but hope.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/07/00/4DFE984700000578-0-image-a-36_1530921149948.jpg","title":"Two cats litter born without legs","story":"    Frog the tabby cat and his brother Newt were both born 10 weeks ago without rear legs          Despite their lack of rear legs, both cats are perfectly able to walk around without any pain          Animal rescuers said the kittens received their names as there are frogs and newts at the centreAnd they are being well cared for at the Rescue Me Animal Sanctuary in Liverpool, which took them in ten days ago after the owner advertised them on social media.The sanctuary is unaware of any other two-legged cats born in the UK.Thought to be ten weeks old, they got their names because there are lots of frogs and newts at the rescue centre.Because they are from the same litter, it is believed inbreeding may have led to them being born without their back legs.

Shockingly, cousin marriages are a key factor in an average of two child deaths every week.This figure is derived from the fact that a total of 545 boys or girls born to closely related couples have died in childhood during the past five years, according to the Department for Education, which collates data from Child Death Overview Panels in every council area. (It is the job of these panels to examine the deaths of any child under the age of 18.)Thousands more children of consanguineous marriages survive, but with appalling physical or mental problems. These include blindness, deafness, blood ailments, heart or kidney failure, lung or liver problems and a myriad of often incurable and complex neurological or brain disorders.According to a report for the BBC’s Newsnight, British Pakistanis are 13 times more likely to have children with genetic disorders than the general population.They are responsible for three percent of all births, but produce just under a third of all British children with such health problems.In Birmingham, around one in ten children from first cousin marriages either dies in infancy or develops a serious life-long disability caused by genetic ailments, according to health officials in the city, where half the mothers of Pakistani origin are married to a close relative.Meanwhile, a research document by the NHS-funded Enhanced Genetic Services Project reveals that in Birmingham in 2009-2010, the combined infant stillbirth and death rate ‘definitely or probably’ due to genetic disorders inherited from Pakistani cousin parents was 38 times higher than that among white European babies in the city.The report — one of the most thorough into this health and social problem — says: ‘Almost a third of the affected children die before five years of age.Most of the survivors suffer chronic disability, and they are cared for by their families, posing tremendous emotional and financial strain.’Up in Bradford, where teenager Hiba Maroof lives, doctors and nurses have told me paediatric wards look after numerous children who are unable to speak, and are fed through tubes.

It also puts him in the company of Hollywood power players such as Oprah, Sarah Jessica Parker and Johnny Depp, each of whom have made literary inroads of their own. In the last decade, in fact, the celebrity imprint has become something of a cottage industry, an endeavor mutually beneficial to publishing houses in pursuit of stars and their lucrative fanbases and celebrities looking for another feather in their cap.Lena Dunham’s Lenny Books, an imprint of Penguin Random House, spawned from the actor-writer’s Lenny newsletter, a weekly feminist bulletin she launched with collaborator Jenni Konner in 2015. Aiming to “to push the ball forward … with wit and style”, the imprint launched in 2017 with Jenny Zhang’s Sour Heart, a collection of coming-of-age tales about young immigrant women in America. Lenny Books’ next release was Courage is Contagious, a series of essays by marquee authors about former first lady Michelle Obama, which was followed this summer by Caroline Kepnes’s novel Providence. As the editorial director of the recently launched SJP for Hogarth, another imprint of Penguin Random House, Sarah Jessica Parker published Fatima Farheen Mirza’s timely novel A Place for Us, about an Indian Muslim family navigating life in California. While a follow-up has yet to be announced, Parker, the honorary chairman of the American Library Association, selected Jonathan Miles’s Anatomy of a Miracle as the organization’s Book Club pick this year.Depp’s cryptically named Infinitum Nihil – meaning “nothing is forever” – was launched in 2012 as a ision of HarperCollins. The actor, unsurprisingly, pledged to green-light “publications that might ordinarily never have breached the parapet”, but in six years the partnership has borne little fruit: projects such as a Bob Dylan biography and a Yoko Ono photo-biopic have been indefinitely delayed. But Depp did release and write the introduction for a long-lost novel by Woody Guthrie, House of Earth, which came out under Harper Perennial.As the natural extension of her uber-successful book club, Oprah Winfrey and Flatiron Books announced An Oprah Book in 2016, the media mogul’s first publishing imprint. Oprah’s memoir, originally titled The Life You Want (now maybe titled The Path Made Clear), was slated to be its flagship release but has since been in limbo. In its absence, though, An Oprah Book led with Food, Health and Happiness, the former talkshow host’s first cookbook. The collection of 115 nutritious, Oprah-approved recipes sold like hotcakes.Though it will close once it’s published all books under contract, the late Anthony Bourdain’s imprint with the publishing house Ecco, Anthony Bourdain Books, has been the most prolific of all celebrity-sanctioned imprints, with almost a dozen releases to its name since launching in 2011. Bourdain, of course, was as much a writer as he was a chef, with a refined taste in literature and an eye for stories, people and places on the margins. That’s reflected in Anthony Bourdain Books, which has published LA Son by Roy Choi, Prophets of Smoked Meat by Daniel Vaughn and Marilyn Hagerty’s Grand Forks, a “history of American dining in 128 reviews”. Before it closes, Anthony Bourdain Books has several more releases in the pipeline, including Jose Andres’ forthcoming We Fed an Island, about the renowned chef’s time in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, and Prisoner by Jason Rezaian.Also with Grand Central Publishing, Handler inked her imprint deal back in 2010, before such forays were the ambition du jour of celebrity bibliophiles. Her first release with Borderline AmazingA Chelsea Handler Book was Lies that Chelsea Handler Told Me, a collection of humiliating tales delivered, as the book jacket states, by Chelsea’s “friends, family and other victims”. The imprint seems to have been dormant since then, with no additional titles to its name, but Handler herself has penned five books with Hachette, including My Horizontal Life, a series of dispatches from the comic’s one-night stands, and the bestselling Are You There, Vodka? It’s Me, Chelsea, the book that confirmed Handler’s literary bona fides.One year before retiring from baseball in 2014, legendary Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter made sure he’d have his hands full by signing a deal with Simon \u0026amp Schuster’s Gallery Books for his own imprint, Jeter Publishing. It’s turned out to be one of the most marketable and consistent of high-profile imprints, with almost a dozen titles to its name including Jeter’s own bestselling autobiography, Jeter Unfiltered, plus memoirs and photo books by athletes such as Rob Gronkowski, Muhammad Ali and Derrick Coleman, the first legally deaf offensive player in the NFL. Now it seems Jeter Publishing is looking beyond the sports world: Rob Scheer’s highly anticipated upcoming memoir, about overcoming abuse, homelessness and a broken foster care system, is slated for a fall 2018 release."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c20a859212324ef50d7dd742643fb1388f3714a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52d89bfd2de7ff617187a43655d1a3b8","title":"chequers summit jeremy kyle real housewives cabinet brexit","story":"With the news ’copters hovering over the Chequers summit like a Kardashian wedding, the prime minister’s guests began rolling up. Try saying them like they’re the England squad announcement. Boris Johnson! Chris Grayling! Andreaaaaa Leadsommmmm! Liz Truss! Michael Gove! Gavin Williamson, bruv! Esther McVeeeeey … ! To watch these country house arrivals was to be struck by one powerful thought: man, I’d watch this version of And Then There Were None so hard. And then I would watch it all over again.At time of writing, it was impossible to predict what would emerge from the crunchiest Brexit crunch meeting since the last one, but – spoilers! – you can be sure the only whodunnit victim will be the British people, whichever way they voted in the EU referendum. Their destiny remains in the hands of a government that would be out-strategised by the electric gates.Cliche demands a Titanic metaphor, so let’s have one: resigning at this stage of the shitshow would be the\u0026nbspequivalent of quitting as ship’s sub-lieutenant 10,000\u0026nbspfeet underwater. Or as No 10 sources let it be known this morning, ministers needed to get behind the PM “or their spots will be taken by a talented new generation who will sweep them away”. Oh, prime minister … don’t do thinly disguised England\u0026nbspfootball metaphors. They’re not for you. You’ve\u0026nbspdimly heard of the golden generation, yes? You’re\u0026nbspthe golden shower generation.Once again, it’s the hysterical smallness of it all. We’ve reached the stage of our national journey when the cabinet’s phones genuinely have to be confiscated on arrival. As a senior government source told the Politico website: “Taxi cards for Aston’s taxis, the local cab firm, are in the foyer for those who decide they can’t face making the right decision for the country.”This was the merely the centrepiece of a series of quotes obviously said for a dare. “It’s a cold world outside government,” the source growled, apparently convinced they were running -Goldwyn-Mayer in the 1930s, and some wannabe starlet had just refused both types of job (nose- and blow-) and was now having her Hollywood non-future explained to her. Same for cabinet ministers thinking of walking. You’ll never eat a ploughman’s in this village again.For an audience who tired of the Real Housewives of the Cabinet franchise about 30 episodes ago, the chance to watch messy bitches who live for drama pour drinks over each other feels less than enticing. Then again, given the briefingcounterbriefingprovocative leaks that characterised the buildup, this is arguably more of a Jeremy Kyle episode. Are you aware of how that show works? Without wishing to let daylight in on tragedy, producers reportedly put the various warring factions up in a hotel the night before they’re on air, and ensure the various participants hear how the other lot are slagging them off.Sound familiar? Europe has always been a Tory family row easily as toxic as classic Kyle shows such as “I’ll Prove the Child You Abused Is Really Your Son!”. Instead of settling the issue, David Cameron amplified it into a sordid circus, full of exploited people, that we’re all condemned to watch. It’s a feud the polygraph test of the referendum didn’t solve because – weirdly – life’s a\u0026nbspbit more complicated than that.What will be the homily at the end of this Chequers-based edition of the show? At every stage in the Brexit process thus far, Theresa May’s government has squandered time searching for “a form of words” that disguises disagreement over “an actual thing”. Frequently, even the form of words has been pre-rejected by the EU. Clearly, this can’t go on for ever, so we have now moved on to forms of words that come pre-rejected by the Americans, who we wish to strike a trade deal with. Americans who – in case it has slipped the PM’s mind before he comes to play kings and queens next week – are ruled by a self-confessed aggressive protectionist.The big question, really, is whether next week can go worse for the government than this one did. Monday kicked things off with the Tory fundraiser, an auto-satirical event where auction lots included a ride in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Bentley. Never mind straight-to-DVD: this government is straight-to-meme. Other prizes included dinner with the Goves, and a bottle of whisky signed by five Conservative prime ministers (pearl-handled revolver not included).By midweek, Brexiter Owen Paterson was suggesting he knew lot more about the car business than the chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover. This is the former environment secretary whose explanation as to why he’d missed his culling target was “the badgers moved the goalposts”. Owen, you were outfoxed by badgers. You’re going to have to defer to the man who makes broom-broom cars on why he might have to take his factories on a permanent holibobs.To cap it all, the eve of the Chequers summit saw the  drop a film called The Week That Broke Brexit, in which a selection of people in significant part responsible for where we find ourselves explained where it all had gone wrong. It was the least convincing series of denials since Shaggy’s It Wasn’t Me. Theresa May was a “third rate administrator”, said Arron Banks (it wasn’t me). “Dereliction of duty”, said the chairman of Vote Leave about Cameron (it wasn’t me). “Overweening ambition”, said Boris Johnson’s aide about Michael Gove (it wasn’t me). And yet, wasn’t it? Without wishing to adopt the impenetrable language of trade diplomacy: picture this, you were all butt naked, banging on the bathroom floor. See also: the counter, the sofa, the shower, and on camera.And now, doubtless, in the Chequers “foyer”, on the croquet lawn, and on the Sunday politics shows. Even the Shaggy song eventually decides the decent thing to do is to apologise for the pain he’s caused. “Officially more shameless than Shaggy” – what a cabinet agreement for our times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb5ee923e936433d40942a7932c4c9174d584e2e/1672_626_2808_1684/master/2808.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76e559c6d07dcf7caaaa9466c598f7c5","title":"jim broadbent dix interview dull margaret graphic novel","story":"What does an Oscar-winning actor do with time on his hands? Team up with cartoonist Dix to tell the story of a vengeful 17th-century peasant You may not think you know Dulle Griet but you probably do – she’s the breastplated peasant striding across a war-torn land towards the mouth of hell in one of the most famous paintings by the 16th-century Flemish master Bruegel the Elder. Bertolt Brecht saw her as his own Mother Courage – “the Fury defending her pathetic household goods with the sword. The world at the end of its tether.”Jim Broadbent’s version of her is rather different. “She’s a plain woman whose tragedy is to look like me,” says the actor, whose dignified recent screen roles, such as the curmudgeonly camera seller in Julian Barnes’s The Sense of an Ending or the tragic Gloucester in Richard Eyre’s King Lear, can lead one to overlook an important biographical detail: he cut his acting teeth in the 1980s as one half of a grandiosely named comedy duo, the National Theatre of Brent, hamming it up as Marie Antoinette or the Virgin Mary in uproarious re-enactments of the Bible and the French revolution.Broadbent, as his friends have told him, is a “notoriously picky” actor, with the result that, while he seems to be a constant presence on stage and screen, he quite often has time on his hands. His original idea was to make a film of Dull Margaret, with himself in the title role. He wrote the screenplay and showed it around, but when the money failed to materialise and he began to feel the zeitgeist moving against female impersonation, he decided to put her in a graphic novel instead. And who better to approach for the illustrations than the Welsh cartoonist Dix, whose Roll up! Roll Up! comic strip for the  had enlivened his day for two years in the early 00s with the antics of a ghoulish circus troupe. “I just felt we shared a sense of humour,” Broadbent says.The Dull Margaret who stars in their new book may be Griet’s darkest incarnation yet. She’s a potato-faced wraith adrift in coastal marshlands who emerges naked from the sea and is not above chopping the hand off a hanged man to enrich a putrid love potion, which she smears on her face in an attempt to witch away her loneliness.Leaping from the end of a jetty on a broomstick, she plops ignominiously into the sea, only to re-emerge two pages later in what looks like a gastroenterologist’s bad trip – a writhing tangle of orange dragon coils looming out of a palette of sombre greys and browns. And so her misfortunes continue, not least because of her own bad behaviour and her inability to choose between money and love.Is she mad? Or monstrous? No, no, no, protests Broadbent, gallantly. “I love her. I have total sympathy for her and enjoy her struggle. In a heightened way, she’s looking for what we all want: comfort, a reasonable standard of living and love. She gets robbed and abused and humiliated, and that sets her on a journey to take back control.”It turns out that this is only the fourth time author and illustrator have met. They collaborated via early-morning emails, because Dix, who lives in Hay-on-Wye and has a day job at a computer software company, does his art work between 11pm and 4am.Dix picks up the story, confessing that it took a while for him to “find” Margaret – “one was too fat, one was too neurotic and one was too vulnerable”. This was partly because he thought Broadbent was after someone who looked like one of his Roll Up! Roll Up! circus grotesques (the horizontal comic strip format rules out long, skinny people).It didn’t help, he adds, that that at first Margaret had no nose. “She was beginning to look a bit aquatic, so we thought later on we’d give her a nose – which was a nice thing to do.” Broadbent’s blue eyes widen at this revelation. “I wasn’t aware of your nose, no-nose journey,” he fires back, though he agrees it was important that she had no fat on her – “she has no carbs in her diet”.Given that Margaret is a mythical figure who rides a broomstick and stirs severed hands into potions, this sudden swerve into dietary literalism might seem surprising – but it underlines how deeply rooted the story is in the marshy coast of Lincolnshire, where Broadbent and his artist wife, Anastasia Lewis, have a cottage.It’s also deeply indebted to Bosch’s hellscapes, Goya’s witches, Daumier’s pictures of travelling acrobats and Rembrandt’s glowering Low Country landscapes – not to mention Dix’s own oddball aesthetic. “Lack of pupils in eyes is something I’m quite fond of,” he says. “It makes people more expressive.” And creepy? “I don’t think it’s creepy at all – and I think that’s something we share.”The pair’s shared sensibility is never more apparent than a six-frame sequence in which Margaret happens upon a bloated white animal corpse, which I mistakenly describe as a sheep. It’s a dog, Dix corrects. Well actually, says Broadbent, it was originally a pig. But they’re both delighted for it to be pointed out because it was the last page they composed. Its single speech bubble – “Cor, what a pong” – is a tribute to the Dandy and Beano comics that Broadbent loved as a child, and which helped to form his sense of comedy.It’s all quite clownish, he says happily, striding out into the streets of Soho, where (despite being unexpectedly long and lean) he is immediately recognised by a giggling trader as Horace Slughorn, the “well-upholstered” potions master who turns himself into an armchair in the Harry Potter films. As another of his creative soulmates, the theatrical hell-raiser Ken Campbell, once put it: “It’s only true if it makes you laugh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5ebc4cf5b705f75613488abbc632673dcd9b6bf/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=257723e2d947c903cb1d0c45bd786fa9","title":"denver on tap are these the best brews in the us","story":"Artisan ale lovers, hop to it: with dozens upon dozens of top breweries and an annual beer fest to boot, Denver’s craft beer scene is the toast of the country.

Chris Moore, the reigning king of catwalk photography, is staging his first ever exhibition at the Bowes Museum in County Durham from Saturday.Catwalking: Fashion through the Lens of Chris Moore will document 60 years’ worth of images from the international collections that take place in New York, London, Milan and Paris, featuring over 200 original photographs hand-chosen by Moore from shows such as Chanel, Christian Dior, Alexander McQueen and Louis Vuitton. Far from comprising straight-forward catwalk images, Moore’s archive stretches back to the couture salons, before the ready-to-wear fashion show as we know it (with photographers huddled in their pack at the end of the catwalk on the plinth known as “the riser”) even existed. This makes for a photographic trip down the most stylish of memory lanes.Fast forward six decades and the landscape has changed. At 84, Moore mostly finds himself nestled in prime position among a 20-strong pack of photographers, all vying for the best shot. Now he provides his shots to international agencies, but over the years he has provided imagery to the , the Observer, Drapers, the Financial Times and the International Herald Tribune, among others. The pack, however, is a supportive bunch. When Moore was hospitalised after a bad fall at the Saint Laurent show in February, his counterparts got together and made sure he was supplied with a selection of the best photos from the show so he didn’t drop a ball. “It’s not as competitive as it looks,” he smiles.The exhibition comes eight months after Moore’s book, Catwalking, was published by Lawrence King and inspired the retrospective. Alexander Fury, editor of Another Magazine, provided the words for the book and co-curated the exhibition.The co-curators wanted the fashion in the images to “physically jump out of the images into three dimensions”, says Fury, and so 40 of the photographs will be shown side-by-side with the actual outfit they feature on loan from houses including Comme des Garçons, Vivienne Westwood, Prada, Jean Paul Gaultier and Versace. “I think a lot of the time with fashion exhibitions you see garments and they’re completely out of context of how they are originally presented, or they can be completely isolated. The unique thing about this is that it was very much about the original context with the physicality of the garments.”The decision to show the exhibition outside the capital was a conscious one. Usually fashion exhibitions of this importance tend to be shown at the V\u0026ampA in London, yet the fact it is in the north – near to wear Moore was born in Newcastle and north of where Fury grew up outside Manchester – is intended to make it more accessible and help inspire a new generation. Moore says he is inspired by and “always learning” from the catwalks – and not just from the clothes. “Miu Miu had Depeche Mode, All I Ever Wanted as its soundtrack for autumnwinter 2014 and being the age I am, I didn’t know who they were, but it was the best song.

In three games Kazan has claimed the winners of 11 World Cups. First Germany went, insipid against South Korea. Then, in a full-blooded epic, Argentina were blown away by France. And then fell the biggest of them all, Brazil, outwitted and outbattled by Belgium, who will face France in Tuesday’s semi-final.Brazil had chances. A few ricochets in the box did not fall their way. The hysteria that always surrounds them, the sense of desire and expectation, perhaps becomes at times inhibitive. Tite, almost certainly, will be blamed, because that is what coaches are for, but his half-time switch to a 4-4-2, bringing on Roberto Firmino in place of Willian and shifting Gabriel Jesus to the right, did stem the Belgian tide. The problem was that by then they were already 2-0 down, having been eviscerated on the break by Kevin De Bruyne. Renato Augusto did pull one back, heading in Philippe Coutinho’s chip with 14 minutes remaining, but Belgium clung on.Kazan has seen some astonishing matches in this World Cup but this, perhaps, was the best as Tite, even-handed as ever, acknowledged. “It was a great game with two teams of incredible technical qualities,” he said. “Even with all the pain I feel now and the bitterness, I say that if you like football, you have to watch this game and you will have pleasure if you are not emotionally involved. Triangulations, transitions, saves, what a beautiful game!”Roberto Martínez may have been almost derided by the end of his time in the Premier League but he deserves enormous credit for Belgium’s victory. His approach was bold, startlingly so, setting out a team that looked like the sort of lineup one would use to chase a game if a goal down with half an hour to go – as, of course they had been against Japan in the last round. Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli, heroes of that comeback, were included and the system was a surprising one: a 4-3-3 with De Bruyne deployed as a false nine and Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard rampaging down the flanks.Both the players Martínez brought in were involved in Belgium’s opener, as was the deployment of De Bruyne. Dropping deep, he sliced open the defence with a through-ball to Fellaini whose scuffed shot yielded a corner. Chadli delivered to the near post and, as Gabriel Jesus and Fernandinho jumped together, the ball deflected in off the midfielder’s right arm.What was really striking, though, was how dangerous Belgium were on the break. They rode their luck to an extent. Thiago Silva bundled an early corner against a post and Paulinho missed his kick when well-placed. Thibaut Courtois made a number of fine saves and bodies were put on the line again and again. But that was always likely to be the case. This, after all, is a Brazil side that had won 20 of their 25 games under Tite and were averaging more than two goals a game. Belgium were always going to have to endure and survive. But they also cut through Brazil over and over again.De Bruyne ran the game, Brazil seemingly unable to decide who should pick him up. Hazard and Lukaku, pulling wide, regularly had space to run into. After a Fernandinho error, it was Lukaku who was the architect of the second goal, carrying the ball forward from his own half, beating Fernandinho and Paulinho and then laying the ball right to De Bruyne. A step inside, a glance up to measure the strike and the ball was flashing beyond Alisson’s right hand into the bottom corner: a brilliant goal and the first time Brazil had conceded two in a game under Tite.Neymar, after all the criticism of his histrionics, was relatively well-behaved but his involvement was so fitful that Thomas Meunier was emboldened to make attacking sallies down the Belgium right. There was even, slightly bizarrely, an incident in the second half when he tangled with Fellaini and fell in the box, then seemed to discourage the Serbian referee, Milorad Mazic, from checking VAR.Marcelo, Coutinho and Neymar had always looked an adventurous left side for Brazil here, it was overwhelmed by\u0026nbspthe Belgian right of Meunier, Fellaini and Lukaku. It was not the collapse of four years ago, or anything like it, but it was, again, a Brazil side unable to handle an opponent adept on the counter.Neymar flickered. Firmino slowly imposed himself. A Jesus e, a Douglas Costa run, the surges of the substitute Augusto could not save them. Courtois made a brilliant tip-over from Neymar in the final minute of injury time. Belgium were exhausted, barely able to carry the ball into the Brazil half on the counter, but they held out and Brazil, like Argentina and Germany before them, succumbed in Kazan, the graveyard of the greats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612168f587754bc53a1c9b900d450e8e0789d2e2/0_287_2769_1662/master/2769.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb4bd3bb44139f0241f7a51cbd864b1d","title":"gareth southgate world cup england best opportunities we ever have","story":"Three steps from football immortality the England manager discusses the importance of the public’s support, the value of squad harmony and the reasons he failed in club managementAs a child he had the team kit, the old Admiral one with the red and blue patches from the 1982 World Cup in Spain. Strictly speaking, his own football career was limited to Crawley Traders under-12s at the time. Yet Gareth Southgate will tell you he always had his dreams, even at that age. When he wore that kit he was Bryan Robson, captaining his country, winning the World Cup.We are sitting in an upstairs room of the Cronwell Park, one of the beachside hotels in Repino, and as Southgate reminisces about his first memories of this tournament the thought occurs that he and his players have the opportunity to create their own history now. One more win would put England in their first World Cup semi-final for more than a quarter of a century. Two more would mean a first final since 1966. Three would be football immortality. No wonder that the man sitting here, preparing for a quarter-final against Sweden, is the most popular person in England right now.Even when he argues there are different layers to his personality – “I’m very conscious I’ve got a lot of faults, the same as everyone, and I have done plenty of things wrong” – he cannot actually list what precisely that entails. All the same it is obvious, Southgate being the man he is, he would rather turn the praise on his players, the coaches, the back-up staff – anyone, in fact, but himself.“There was a big thing made of me going up to the Colombia players to console them after the game,” he says, to cite one example. “For me, that was just a natural response. You have been in a battle with another team. There’s huge respect for the fact they have pushed us all the way and, by the way, I always think it is easier to do that sort of thing when you have won rather than when you have lost. The mark is when you’ve been beaten, and how you deal with that. I mean, it’s easy to be magnanimous in victory, isn’t it?”Possibly, yet the point here was that Southgate made a beeline for Mateus Uribe, one of the players whose failure in the penalty shootout put Colombia out of the competition. Southgate, after all, knows a thing or two about being in that position from Euro 96 and the ordeal of “knowing straight away it would be a major issue for the rest of my life”.Already he is discovering that the life of a successful England manager – or a semi-successful one, as he would say – means being asked about more than just kicking a piece of leather round a stretch of grass. There have been requests during this tournament for his opinions on Brexit. He has been asked about the Putin stand-off and whether, on his return to England, he will be setting out his vision for the way his own country is run. Gareth Southgate for prime minister, anyone?Another time, maybe. For now he would rather focus on the next match and, at the end of the tournament, his intention is “disappearing as quickly as I possibly can and staying out of the way of everything ... the nice thing is I might not have to travel as far away as I would have if we’d had a really bad tournament.”The point is not lost on him, however, that he is now an ambassador and spokesman for his country, with the power to influence people. “The players have that opportunity as well,” he says. “They have a voice, too. They can influence young people, especially from the areas where they came from. They can give hope to them. We’re not a team that just turns up, waltzing around, strolling around, thinking we’ve got an entitlement. We’re lads who have come from Barnsley and Leeds and Blackburn and that’s so important for Saturday because I always think Sweden like to point out that we’re paid this and that, and we’re the team of entitlement, when I really don’t think that is the case for this group.”In the process, Southgate has taken a sledgehammer to the theory that managing England is the Impossible Job. “In life there are really complex, difficult jobs and some are more complicated and difficult than others. But when you look around at inventions, or records that have been broken, you have to tell yourself that anything is possible.His team selection for the Belgium match was a case in point, making eight changes in a deliberate ploy to involve his fringe players (reducing the possibility of splits behind the scenes) while making sure his first-choice XI was fresh for the next assignment. “I could easily have been distracted, influenced and affected by ‘Oh, if I make that decision that’s not going to be popular’, knowing it is going to open ourselves to criticism.” England’s 1-0 defeat that night did indeed lead to a flurry of hysteria from outsiders who could not grasp the logic.Heady times, indeed, and it is the way Southgate has gone about his business – modest, self-deprecating, generous with his time, always respectful – that has endeared him to so many people. His response, for instance, to being asked about the “slightly questionable lyrics” of the Atomic Kitten song that has been turned into a supporters’ chant in his honour: “Not as questionable as most of the lyrics of songs about me in the past, so long may that continue.”Spend any time in his company and you will hear him emphasise the “harmony” of his squad. After games Southgate always refers to the players who did not feature. He cares, he really does. “I am watching Phil Jones, Gary Cahill and Danny Welbeck train at such a high level and we won’t succeed without them. They are bloody unfortunate not to be in the side and it is only a consequence of the way we have been playing. You don’t succeed unless there is harmony, unless they push each other, and the lads recognise that.”“It’s great. We have, as a group, been through so much already. Phil Jones’s wife giving birth, now Fabian’s. All the staff are away from their families for such a long period of time, as well. We know that what we are trying to achieve is huge and it’s easy for people to say: ‘Well, blimey, we’d all give up six weeks of our life to experience what you’re experiencing.’ Nevertheless, there is an impact and I am very conscious of that. It has been lovely to have some of the families come in, to have the kids around the hotel and meet the parents.”If the Football Association has any sense, the logical step is surely to make this a long-term project and trust Southgate in the way Germany have with Joachim Löw for the last 12 years. That appeals to Southgate, too. But equally he goes back to the point that he has been in football long enough to know how quickly perceptions can change.“In any club there comes a point – and it’s the same with the national team – where people have heard the message enough. They’ve listened to the soundbites. The players will want a different voice. The press and the public will want a different voice. That will happen at some point.For the time being it is enough that he has turned England into a fully functioning and genuinely likable team. When Southgate took over in September 2016, on an emergency basis, it followed Sam Allardyce’s 67-day reign, with England’s reputation not so much low as subterranean. The previous summer there was the defeat by Iceland in Euro 2016. The fans were bordering on mutiny. For Southgate, unashamedly patriotic, it was galling to see the disconnect between team and supporters. But no longer.“My belief was always that the desire for the national team was there but it was almost like we’d had so much pain we wanted to push it to one side and not admit it. You put things down because you don’t want to get hurt at times.And now here we are, one victory away from the possibility of emulating Bobby Robson’s team in Italia 90 by reaching a World Cup semi-final. Southgate’s eyes light up when Robson’s name is mentioned and he recalls a story about his first experience of club management. “He came to Middlesbrough to talk to me and give me support. It was very special for me because he recognised the difficulties of being a young manager. He was an absolute gent. I’d met him a few times as a player, too. I remember being injured once at Aston Villa and at half-time he walked 15 yards the other way from the tunnel to come and see if I was OK.”That, however, feels like a long time ago now. Whatever happens on Saturday, Southgate has shown it is possible to embrace the England team again. And these are moments to cherish. “I’m bloody proud of being English and I’m so pleased that football has such a great ability to unite people and bring positivity in moments like this. That is really special. To effect something like that is really special.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/731aa3b0cb74fd530610bab9a7f81a4f4b3b7223/0_52_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c47ea4ca4f01713f2a3fd2cd38208766","title":"russia world cup stanislav cherchesov friends high places","story":"It has been one of the images of the World Cup so far. Eyebrows raised, shoulders back, palms upturned, Vladimir Putin savoured Russia’s breakthrough goal in the opening game against Saudi Arabia before he leant into a handshake with Mohammed bin Salman.Putin was not finished. When the president’s team made it 5-0 in stoppage time, he held his hands wide apart in the most expansive of shrugs. There was no handshake on this occasion for the Saudi crown prince. With the scoreline as it was, it might have looked patronising.The first thing to say is that many Russian people absolutely loved Putin’s reactions, which were somehow in keeping with his public image. Big Vlad is the big man over here and there is Putin merchandise across all of the tat stores, plenty of which depicts him looking hard and cool.The wider point is that, in a heartbeat, Putin caught the mood of pleasant surprise. Russia’s tournament had opened to a backdrop of pessimism, with Stanislav Cherchesov’s team – who had gone seven matches without a win – written off as the worst in living memory. Russia not only won El Gasico, they followed it up by thumping Egypt. There was a return to type in game three, when they were taken apart by Uruguay and, before the last-16 tie with Spain, the fatalism was back. Cherchesov and his players needed a miracle.After a resolute defensive display, they got one in the shape of the penalty shootout triumph and, in a country that likes to swing from one extreme to the other, the mood has transformed. Now, there is rampant optimism the feeling that anything is possible. If “Ros-Si-Ya” can beat Spain, then why not Croatia in Saturday’s quarter-final in Sochi? Croatia, certainly, did not look like world-beaters in their last-16 shootout win over Denmark.Cherchesov was asked whether Croatia was the match of his life, and that of his players. “I hope that the most important games are still ahead of us,” he said, with a shrug of which Putin would have been proud. Cherchesov paused. He had made his point. “Is this a good answer?” he asked. “Brevity is the sister of genius, as Anton Chekhov said.”The 19th-century playwright could not have scripted Russia’s upsurge and not only because his work tended to be associated with gloominess. Even the greatest writer of fiction would have hesitated to put Russia in a first World Cup quarter-final since 1970, when they competed as the Soviet Union. They are, after all, the lowest-ranked team at the finals. Yet here they are.Cherchesov said he was “not a daydreamer”. He has a goal and it is to beat Croatia. His watchwords have been focus and balance. “We Russians like extremes but let’s not go to extremes,” Cherchesov said. “The media can be euphoric, not us. Reminding ourselves about Spain is a good story but let’s look forward. Criticism is good. We should have our eyes open and our ears ready and being praised all the time is bad. At the same time, the criticism should be analytical. It should not be to humiliate.”Cherchesov was joined at the press conference by Mario Fernandes and, if one player symbolises the squad’s capacity to overcome, it is he. The Brazil-born right-back had depression after he signed his first senior contract at Grêmio in 2009, had problems with his diet and also drank and partied too\u0026nbspmuch.At 21, Fernandes was called up by Brazil but he went on a night out and missed his flight. He was kicked out of the squad. He turned his life around when he moved to CSKA Moscow in 2012 and, although he would be capped by Brazil in 2014, he applied for Russia citizenship on residency grounds and, in 2017, he made his debut for them. Fernandes has excelled at this tournament. “The problems I had are in the past,” he said. “I’m a different man now.”Cherchesov reported that the attacking midfielder Alan Dzagoev, who has been out with a hamstring injury since the Saudi game, had returned to training and was available. Aleksandr Golovin, however, has impressed as the No\u0026nbsp10 in his absence. The left-back Yuri Zhirkov is fighting a calf problem.What of the other piece of team news? Will Putin attend? His spokesman, Dmitry Pestov, has said that Putin will watch the game in Moscow because he is so busy but it would not be a surprise if he showed up. Putin loves Sochi and he has a residence here. “The president called me before and after the Spain game,” Cherchesov said. “When he supports us, it makes us comfortable. It’s an extra boost in terms of motivation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d939142e0eb497e9fa8950f69ac1ca67851735c0/48_25_2317_1390/master/2317.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=458ed299d7775f53956f3507c2ce553f","title":"three things england get right defeat sweden world cup quarter final","story":"Harry Kane needs a more regular supply from the flanks, the Swedes need to be stretched by quick, incisive passing and the whole side need to stay calm and retain their focusHarry Kane is the tournament’s leading scorer with six and yet has managed to fire only nine attempts at goal to date. To offer some context, Cristiano Ronaldo’s four goals came from 21 shots and Lionel Messi’s one from 17.All six he has managed on target – three of them penalties and one that freak deflection that completed his hat-trick against Panama – have yielded reward, with the other three deflected, veering wide from distance or looping on to the roof of the net. The need for England to find him more regularly in scoring positions is all too evident.The striker is ruthless but for long periods to date England have not found him in threatening areas. To all intents he has been feeding off scraps.Much has been made of Dele Alli, Raheem Sterling and Jesse Lingard as a fluid supply line but, of the 79 passes Kane has received in his four games in Russia, only 24 have come from that trio and the majority have found him with his back to goal.Furthermore, according to Opta, Kieran Trippier has made only three passes – a tally which includes crosses – to his captain to date and Ashley Young four from the opposite flank. England will need more accurate and incisive delivery from the flank in open play to unsettle a resolute Swedish backline.Sweden will be stubborn opposition. They have kept three clean sheets in their four matches to date, compressing space efficiently between the lines and defending with all 11 players.Andreas Granqvist does not quite boast the frame and presence of Colombia’s 6ft 5in centre-back Yerry Mina but he is not far off, and Janne Andersson’s side should not wilt at English set pieces, which is a worry. So the onus will be on creating from open play and discomforting awkward opponents by shifting the ball swiftly and efficiently. That has not always been a forte.For example Alli, his tournament disrupted by that thigh strain sustained against Tunisia, has given the ball away 23 times, perhaps as he strives for greater involvement having missed those two matches through injury. England need his influence in more advanced areas.“Dele did a diligent job with the ball for us against Colombia, we have to encourage him into areas where his real strengths lie and he can influence the game,” Southgate said. “We want to create more clear‑cut chances and Dele is a player who gives us a different option to do that.”Moving the ball more sharply still, stretching the play with width provided from wing-back, should create the space in which Alli can thrive.Everything has been level-headed within the England camp, even as Southgate’s players tick off their achievements: progress from the group win a penalty shootout secure passage through a knockout tie. Everything the manager offers up publicly comes with the caveat that this is a young and developing team, a side reconnecting with their fan base and still finding their feet at this level.Yet there is a realisation, too, that England are in a mouth-watering position. “It’s a great opportunity,” said Southgate. “Although our team will be inidually better in two years’ time, we might not have this opportunity again.”Recognising that much will create its own pressures, of course, and expectancy has grown with each hint of progress. Yet England have to stay grounded. They have beaten Sweden only twice in 15 matches.“They are a team we have underestimated in the past but we shouldn’t get carried away with ourselves being better than Sweden. They are older, more experienced and have a better tournament record than us. Look at their results in qualifying – beating France, beating Italy in the play-off, knocking out Germany here. They’re obviously a very strong side and one we’ll have to play well against to beat.”The message is clear: stay calm, retain focus and make quality tell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e44428bf2a1a49dcf36e79f7b965ab9f93df7c5b/82_291_4895_2937/master/4895.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2df236bcac6914dff0fb80716bf04c8f","title":"world cup 2018 quarter final brazil v belgium live","story":"Well, that was a special game. Belgium were outstanding in attack in the first half, and by the end of the second half pretty resolute in defence as well. Brazil will point to the penalty non-decision, and it may well be that Vincent Kompany got away with clipping Neymar there. On another day, with another referee, and other folks in the VAR booth ... but this was Belgium’s moment, and on balance they were deserved winners. They reach the World Cup semi-finals for only the second time: France await in St Petersburg on Tuesday. As for Brazil, the wait for World Cup number six will now stretch to 20 years at least. Thanks for reading. Nighty night, and sweet dreams, wherever you are.And now a chat with Kevin De Bruyne. “It is not easy to play against Brazil, they are such a wonderful team. But I think the power we have as a team we showed today. Especially the first half, we were magnificent. We took the advantage. They changed tactically and it was difficult, but even then we created some chances. And after their goal it was a character test, and we showed the world what we are capable of.”And now a chance to rate everyone’s performance.Here’s our on-the-whistle match report.Belgium coach Roberto Martinez speaks! “There were incredible hearts out there. Sometimes you have to accept that Brazil have so much finesse and quality that they’re going to break you down. But we didn’t accept it. Not for one minute did they give up. This was something special. These boys deserve to be very special people back in Belgium. I hope everybody back in Belgium is very proud. The execution of the tactics was magnificent. In two days they changed their tactical disposition, I couldn’t be prouder. We cannot let people down. We need to enjoy beating Brazil in the knockout phase, treasure it, and pass it down the generations. But we need more energy for the next game. We will be as good as we can be in the semi-final.”All the Belgian players fall into each other’s arms. A mixture of excitement, relief and plain old exhaustion. Meanwhile there’s a haunted look on the faces of Neymar and Coutinho. I suppose this qualifies as a shock, sort of, given the respective histories and size of these two footballing nations. But a reminder that while Brazil are ranked as the second-best team in the world right now, Belgium are number three. They were magnificent in attack during the first half ... and in that second period, finally demonstrated that they can defend when the going gets tough, too. They’ve proved they could be worthy winners of the World Cup. Can France, England, Sweden, Croatia or Russia stop them?The favourites are out! They’ve been sent packing by Belgium, who have reached their second World Cup semi-final. They’ll play France on Tuesday. What a match that was!90 min +5: Brazil are heading out. De Bruyne meanders down the right and eventually wins a corner. This is surely over.90 min +4: Douglas Costa comes in from the right. He slips the ball across the face of the box for Neymar, who opens his body and looks to curl one into the top right. It’s heading in ... whereupon Courtois, at full stretch, fingertips it over the bar! What a save! The resulting, desperate corner comes to nothing.90 min +2: Anyway, that was the first of five added minutes. And now the second has elapsed too. Hazard draws a foul from Miranda and celebrates it like he would a goal. He knows how close Belgium are to a semi-final with France.90 min +1: Neymar challenges for a Douglas Costa cross from the right. He’s touched lightly on the back by Meunier and goes down. He wants a penalty. VAR has a look, but quickly decides no. There was contact, but it was a very light brush. Some payback for the Wilmots decision in 2002?90 min: Hazard spins on a sixpence and tears off into space. Fagner takes a yellow card to stop the breakaway.89 min: Marcelo crosses from the left. But Firmino can’t get his head on it. Vermaelen clears.88 min: Neymar spins and breaks into the Belgian box. For a second it looks like he’ll work space for a shot, but Alderweireld blocks his road. Neymar runs it out of play for a goal kick. Frustration written all across his face.87 min: Belgium replace the hard-running Lukaku with the defensively minded Tielemans.85 min: Fernandinho is booked for tripping Hazard from behind, the Belgian having swanned past him in style.84 min: Firmino comes racing down the middle, then springs Neymar free down the left. It’s a gorgeous pass. Neymar glides into the area, and pulls one back to tee up the in-rushing Coutinho. He’s got to get his shot on target at least, but shanks an awful effort miles right. He falls to the ground in despair, his face buried in his hands.82 min: Chadli goes down, knackered, and takes an age to leave the field. He’s eventually replaced by Vermaelen, with Belgium desperately trying to shore things up at the back. Can they see this out?80 min: This is wonderful end-to-end fun. Coutinho slips a pass down the middle of the park for Augusto, who pulls the trigger and sends a fierce low shot inches wide of the bottom left. Courtois was rooted to the spot had it been on target, it was in.79 min: Brazil win a corner. Belgium break upfield from it. They’re four on two at one point. Hazard drifts in from the right and tries to spring De Bruyne clear down the left. But his crossfield pass is easily intercepted by Douglas Costa.78 min: Neymar makes good down the left and flicks the ball into the area for Firmino. He’s got his back to goal, ten yeards out, level with the left-hand post. Firmino spins and sends a full-power rising blast inches away from the top-left corner. Just too high. Neymar wanted the return pass, but Firmino was this close to levelling things up! It was a fine effort.77 min: Well that’s changed the mood. The Brazil fans had understandably fallen quiet, but that superb Coutinho pass, and Augusto’s equally impressive finish, has taken the lid off this stadium!Neymar has a shot. Courtois saves. Brazil come again. Coutinho, 30 yards out, down the inside-left channel, spots Augusto alone in the area. He loops a gorgeous, perfectly weighted cross onto Augusto’s head. Augusto guides his header into the bottom right, out of Courtois’ reach. Game on!74 min: Brazil continue to dominate territorially, but they’re not causing Belgium too many palpitations. Douglas Costa comes in from the right and tries to flick one into the bottom left with the outside of his boot. It’s an overly fussy effort and sails harmlessly across goal and out for a goal kick.73 min: Renato Augusto comes on for Paulinho. Tite’s last roll of the dice ... unless his side can somehow force extra time from here.71 min: Meunier will miss the semi-final should Belgium make it. He steps across Neymar cynically, and that’s an obvious yellow card, his second of the tournament.69 min: Lukaku burns Miranda down the right, a spectacular burst of speed. He’s free in the box ... at which point he takes a heavy touch and clanks the ball out for a goal kick. Brazil are having to commit men forward now, and there are holes at the back. More holes. New holes.68 min: Fernandinho is down, having been accidentally clapped in the face by Witsel. As he gets some treatment, Brazil effectively take a time-out, swigging water and having a tactical pow-wow.66 min: Brazil’s frustration bubbles to the surface as Coutinho passes the ball straight out of play down the right, in a ham-fisted effort to find Douglas Costa. A lot of frowning and muttering.65 min: Belgium play a bit of keep-ball. It’s good game management, because we’re coming to the stage where the clock becomes their friend.63 min: Douglas Costa dribbles into the Belgian area from the right. He shoots low and hard. Courtois parries by the right-hand post. The ball doesn’t quite break to Coutinho, who was preparing to stab home. Brazil are certainly asking questions.62 min: Belgium come close to a third. Brazil press, but Chadli breaks down the left, draws Fernandinho and flicks inside. De Bruyne powers goalwards, then feeds Hazard on the left. Hazard enters the area and fires a low shot across Alisson and out for a goal kick. He had Lukaku in the middle, probably the better bet. So close to sealing the deal!60 min: Belgium can’t get out of their final third. Marcelo and Douglas Costa take turns to come at them. They’re holding on ... but only just.58 min: Douglas Costa comes on for Jesus.57 min: The ref’s not changing his mind. No penalty. The referee decided the evidence wasn’t crystal clear. No doubt we’ll be hearing about that if Brazil crash out.56 min: Jesus nutmegs Vertonghen on the right. He rounds the defender and makes for the six-yard box. Kompany slides in to meet Jesus before he can shoot, and the pair slide off the pitch. He says no penalty ... but they’re checking it on VAR.54 min: Brazil have been better since the restart, though. Paulinho powers down the inside-right channel and nearly manages to force the ball past Courtois. But he can’t prod his shot on target, and Belgium clear.52 min: Marcelo zips past Meunier again. The cross isn’t so good this time. Then Neymar cuts in from the left. He runs past Fellaini, then drops to the floor. He wants a penalty kick, but the referee very forcefully tells him to get up. When play finally stops, he gives Neymar a bollocking.51 min: Marcelo twists, then turns Meunier inside out down the left. It’s a superb dribble, and he delivers a cross to match, a low fizzer through the six-yard box that Firmino was this close to toe-poking home.49 min: Firmino drives at the Belgian defence and slips the ball to Neymar, who over-elaborates. The move fizzles out. Lukaku barges up the other end, down the inside-right channel. He enters the box but can’t get a shot away because Miranda is sticking to him like glue. Good luck guessing the final score of this. It surely can’t stay 0-2, can it?47 min: The ball’s played backwards rather than hoicked into the area. It’s then dinked forward for Fellaini, whose flick-on goes nowhere. Brazil try to launch an attack, but Paulinho is cynically barged over by Alderweireld, who is booked. A scrappy start to the half.46 min: Hazard drifts down the left and draws a foul from Paulinho. An early chance to test Brazil’s back line again. Belgium load the box. Meanwhile here’s Gregory Phillips: “At the time, the Brazil World Cup drought from 1970-1994 seemed endless (even though for me, it started in 1982 when I saw them lose to Italy in the first World Cup I remember watching). But if this result holds they’ll be looking at another break of at least 20. And yet 2002 seems like the other day.”So we’re off again! Belgium get the ball rolling for the second half of this astonishing and entertaining quarter-final. Brazil have replaced Willian with Roberto Firmino. “Lukaku, DeBruyne and Hazard are electric together,” writes Hubert O’Hearn. “Can you imagine if they were on the same club ... what? THEY WERE? What idiot bungled that up?”The scoreline of this game could be 5-0, 0-5 or 5-5. But as it panned out, it’s just 0-2. Belgium have been magnificent. Brazil have, too, in parts, but they lost their belief when that De Bruyne screamer went in. It’s going to be a heck of a second half, because the favourites Brazil need to stage the sort of comeback they’ve not managed at a World Cup since going two down against Sweden and winning 4-2 in ... 1938. Go nowhere!45 min +1: Neymar tears off after a long pass down the inside-left. But his shot from the edge of the box is deflected, and he’s offside anyway.45 min: Neymar cuts in from the left, spins, and goes over in the vicinity of Meunier. He wants a penalty kick, but he’s not getting one.44 min: Brazil probe, but don’t really press, and so don’t advance into the final third. All of a sudden, the Belgian back line looks a little more solid. There’s not much space. That surely won’t last.42 min: Chadli’s delivery is poor, but Kompany performs an improvised backflick by the near post, and very nearly finds the bottom corner! Alisson reacts very well to gather.41 min: De Bruyne curls one over the wall and up towards the top-left corner. Alisson tips it nervously over the crossbar. Corner.40 min: De Bruyne presses down the inside-left channel and is shoved in the back by Paulinho. A free kick, to the left of the D. As he sets up his wall, the blood slowly drains from Alisson’s face.39 min: Belgium come at Brazil twice in a matter of 90 seconds, the yellow shirts backpedalling in panic. Fortunately for Brazil, Lukaku and De Bruyne take turns to over-elaborate on the edge of the area with options a-plenty. Brazil are all over the show.37 min: Neymar and Marcelo combine well down the left. The ball’s deflected goalwards, forcing Courtois to parry round the post for a corner. From which Coutinho cuts inside from the left, and sends a power curler towards the bottom right. He caught that one! But Courtois spectacularly tips round the post. Fine save! The second corner is a non-event.35 min: Marcelo dribbles well down the left, and floats a fine cross into the centre. Jesus is all alone on the penalty spot, but his attempt to guide a header into the top right sails wide. Close, though. It’s not as though Brazil have been toothless. The scoring is surely not over. It’s surely far from over.33 min: Hazard and Chadli skitter at speed down the left. For a second Brazil look super-light at the back again. And during that second, the mind suddenly wandered back to that first-half collapse four years ago. A third goal would have turned a sensational start into something a bit more surreal. But we’re not there yet. The Belgians confuse each other and the move breaks down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4455899570badff2edc9886dffa64437fbac1a54/0_0_8533_5120/master/8533.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8185c6bdd95da703a84378824984470","title":"should we stop trying to contact our half sister","story":"She lives with her grandparents, but when we wrote they said they wanted no contact.

If only feeding children was always so easy.These delicate balls freeze well, so make double the quantity and stash half for later.For the dumplings500g ricotta225g courgette, coarsely grated250g spinach leaves65g grated parmesan2 eggs125g plain flour, plus extra to dust1½ tsp flaky, or ½ tsp fine sea saltBlack pepper50g butter, to serveFor the sauce8 large ripe tomatoes (or 2 tins drained plum tomatoes)2 garlic cloves, finely sliced4 tbsp olive oil2 tsp red-wine vinegar1 big handful basil leavesBrown sugar (optional)Drain the ricotta for at least 30 minutes to remove as much excess water as possible.Put the courgettes in a large sieve or colander suspended over a bowl. Bring a pan of salted water to a boil and blanch the spinach for one to two minutes, until it has collapsed. Pour the spinach water over the grated courgettes to wilt it, then leave both vegetables to drain in the sieve. When the vegetables are cool enough to touch, squeeze out the water, dry on kitchen paper, chop finely and put in a bowl. Add the ricotta, parmesan, eggs, flour, half the salt and plenty of black pepper, and mix well with a fork or wooden spoon and adjust the seasoning, to taste .Dust your hands and a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper with flour. Mould the dough into golfballs – keep dusting your hands in more flour or the dough will stick to you. Lay the balls out on the tray, then refrigerate while you make the sauce.If using fresh tomatoes, score the top of each with an X and cover with boiling water from the kettle. Leave for 30 seconds, then drain. Peel the skin and roughly chop the flesh.Gently fry the garlic in the oil in a small pan over a medium-low heat until it begins to turn pale gold, then add the chopped tomatoes and vinegar, to stop the garlic burning. Season, simmer for 10-15 minutes until thick, then tear in the basil. Add a few pinches of brown sugar if the tomatoes taste flat.Once the sauce is ready, bring a large pan of salted water to a boil. When the water is simmering, cook a few dumplings at a time until they float to the surface, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper.Once the dumplings are all cooked, heat a wide frying pan over a medium heat and melt the butter. Baste the dumplings in the butter until hot and glistening. Spoon the warm tomato sauce on to plates or shallow bowls, then top with the dumplings. Grate over a little extra parmesan and serve.The tomato sauce is incredibly versatile for barbecued summer vegetables or meatballs. Play around with the herbs and spices in the dumplings – cinnamon and mint, or chervil and dill are both great combinations. I like to add capers or sage leaves to the butter in which I am basting the dumplings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then. Russia 2018 is already well under way: another impossibly exciting, complex, wild-looking Fifa World Cup. And in its shadow, here we are too.Welcome to another mob-handed, obsessively planned, lovingly curated effort to bring you the  and Observer’s World Cup coverage in every conceivable form, to your every conceivable screen. This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business. Asking our readers to become subscribers, or to contribute to pay for something they value is, in our opinion, the best way forward. So if you like this stuff and think it’s worth helping it to continue, then why not make an additional contribution to the . It only takes a minute and can be as little as £1 if you’re particularly tight or shameless. Yes, sport can be seen as a glorious irrelevance, but it also says something about who we are. And hopefully our coverage makes you sound slightly less unintelligent than you are during a discussion of the reactive gegenpress in the local Wetherspoons. Perhaps it lights up your enjoyment via the frankly brilliant reporting of our football hacks, led of course (damn him) by annual award hoover Danny Taylor, and backed up by the likes of Dominic Fifield, Martha Kelner, Dave Hytner, Stuart James and, with the long range heavy artillery, the mind bogglingly good Marina Hyde. Perhaps you even enjoy reading the World Cup Fiver, following the multi award winning* daily World Cup blog, and listening to Max, Barry and star guests speak their brains over four increasingly hysterical weeks of World Cup Football Daily.

That included a proposal to “create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products” after Brexit.Tory Brexiters voiced concern at the agreement, while soft Brexiters expressed relief. Andrea Jenkyns, a hardline MP, complained that “British businesses will continue to be a rule taker from the EU” and said she would “pray” that the detail was not as bad as she feared. Heidi Allen, a moderate, said she was “pleased to report Theresa May has secured cabinet agreement for a sensible, soft Brexit”.On Thursday, when the common rule book proposal was first leaked, hardline Brexiter cabinet ministers and Conservative MPs voiced alarm that it could prevent the UK striking a trade deal with the US, which has different standards in goods and foods, such as allowing chickens to be washed in chlorine.But May was able to release the text of a three-page agreed statement before cabinet, following a relatively undramatic day of discussions, sat down for dinner to listen to No 10 communications chiefs make a presentation on how to sell the new proposals.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, appeared to react warmly to the proposals, noting in a tweet that the “Chequers discussion on future to be welcomed. I look forward to white paper. We will assess proposals to see if they are workable and realistic”. The CBI and the Institute of Directors (IoD) business groups also voiced relief.The prime minister made clear that she expected ministers would be sacked if they did not remain in line with her soft Brexit blueprint. She wrote to Tory MPs to explain her plans and included a clear warning about discipline: “As we developed our policy on Brexit, I have allowed cabinet colleagues to express their inidual views. Agreement on this proposal marks the point where that is no longer the case and collective responsibility is now fully restored.”Ministers had been told to surrender their phones in line with what was described as “standard practice for cabinet meetings” when they arrived at Chequers at around 10am with none of their advisers present, meaning that they were not able to immediately present their version of events.May had asked everybody with the right to attend cabinet to be present, a total of 29 people, meaning that a greater proportion of those present were expected to be loyal to her. Despite speculation that some ministers could stage a walkout through the Buckinghamshire countryside to the nearest train station, there was no sign of Boris Johnson or any other hard Brexiter leaving before dinner. One minister said that Johnson “was actually very big about it and by dinner spoke passionately in favour of making it work”.The cabinet agreement represents a rapid turnaround in a 24-hour period after the prime minister had been forced on to the defensive after the “common rule book” proposal was leaked. Seven cabinet ministers had met to discuss their concerns at the Foreign Office, led by Johnson and including Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt, David Davis, Liam Fox, Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom.Johnson went on to see David Cameron on Thursday evening at a meeting in which the accounts of what happened were disputed on Friday. Sources close to Johnson tried to claim that the two men agreed the plans presented by the prime minister were “the worst of all worlds” and that he told his fellow Etonian he should finally take pride in Brexit, having called the referendum.Cameron’s former spin doctor Sir Craig Oliver rebutted the claims, saying that the former prime minister had “always understood compromise will be necessary”. He added: “It’s also wrong to claim he sees himself as ‘the father of Brexit’. Why would that be true when he fought it tooth and nail?” Others added that Cameron had even persuaded Johnson not to resign from the government. It will now be the job of cabinet members to brief MPs in the party as to the merits of the negotiating strategy proposed by May that will form the basis of a Brexit white paper due to be published next week.The government statement formally proposed a new “third way” for handling customs, ending the cabinet standoff between May’s once preferred “customs partnership” and the Brexiter’s “maximum facilitation” models. It said that the UK would propose a new “facilitated customs arrangement” which would see the UK levy its own tariffs and then refund the difference if the goods went on to the EU.One Tory MP said that Jacob Rees-Mogg had messaged members of the European Research Group’s WhatsApp group telling them not to post their thoughts immediately, but instead to email them to him, giving his email address from the investment company he co-runs. Stephen Martin, the director general of the IoD, said: “News that an agreement has been reached is very welcome. Our members have wanted cabinet to come together and put the interest of the country first, so firms across the UK will see this as a positive step forward.”Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to the UK, would not be drawn into the detail of the trade deal row but, speaking earlier on Friday, reiterated Donald Trump’s desire to reach agreement with Britain. “The president has been clear since the beginning of his term – he wants to do a bilateral trade deal and he’s really ready to step up on that the minute he gets the go-ahead to do it. And he’ll get it done fast, as I know it’s a major priority for him,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4837532de372ba6b647bd9cf7d10f26de1b6a3ff/0_34_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80c166098b302475c0e43b6a49f3d0c2","title":"what the cabinet has agreed at chequers brexit meeting","story":"Theresa May and her cabinet have reached agreement on how to approach final Brexit talksAfter a long day of talks at Chequers, the cabinet has agreed what Theresa May hailed as a “collective position for the future of our negotiations” on Brexit. It might yet be modified amid Brussels objections or MPs’ concerns but below is the plan as agreed, as set out in a government statement:The statement says the UK will “maintain a common rulebook for all goods” including agricultural products after Brexit, with the UK committing via treaty on continued harmonisation, thus avoiding border friction.Parliament would have oversight of such rules, it adds, and can choose to not continue harmonisation “recognising that this would have consequences”. However, the proposal says protections in areas such as the environment, employment laws and consumer protection would not fall below current levels.The arrangement would see looser arrangements for services, with a recognition this will involve less mutual access to markets than currently.The plan proposes what is termed a “joint institutional framework” for interpreting UK-EU agreements, to be carried out in each jurisdiction by the respective courts. However, decisions by UK courts would involve “due regard paid to EU caselaw in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook”.The system would include joint committees, or binding independent arbitration in the case of disputes, which would have reference to the European court of justice (ECJ) “as the interpreter of EU rules”.The government statement puts forward the idea of the so-called facilitated customs arrangement, May’s new attempt at a compromise system that could be acceptable to her cabinet Brexiters and to Brussels.This would see the UK and EU avoid hard borders by being treated as a “combined customs territory”. Under this, the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, and their EU equivalents for goods heading into the EU.This would, the document says, let a post-Brexit UK set its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world without causing border disruption. The statement says the new arrangements would prevent a hard Irish border, ensuring the “backstop” elements of the initial withdrawal agreement would not be needed.The statement ends by saying the plans, along with details to be set out in next week’s planned white paper, represent “a precise and responsible approach to the final stage of the negotiations”, giving frictionless trade in goods along with regulatory flexibility for services.The plan, it adds, would still give the UK an independent trade policy, with the ability to set its own non-EU tariffs and to reach separate trade deals. It also promises to end the role of the ECJ in UK affairs.Such a deal would end the automatic free movement of people into the UK from the EU but include a “mobility framework” allowing easy movement for work or study.Beyond whatever objections and modifications the EU might present, the statement is broad enough to be open to significant interpretation by ministers of various Brexit hues, not to mention backbench Conservative MPs.While the plan states it has not breached any of May’s stated red lines, it is a distinctly soft variant of the proposed Brexits on offer and, even if it is not amended or ditched, outside pressure could place different interpretations on the terms stated. This is version one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41c72d3c3df1c134171155e08c0ed74926f1c19d/0_12_7832_4699/master/7832.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd3cd0d9466958fca54c26f3e3493703","title":"may tells brexiters mps would reject their plans as allies predict no split at key chequers meeting politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happened, including Theresa May chairing a key cabinet meeting at Chequers to decide the UK’s Brexit strategyThe reaction seems to be drying up, which is perhaps understandable – given the time – so we’re going to close this live blog now. Thanks for reading. Here’s a summary of the evening’s events:You can read the full report from my colleagues in Westminster here:And here is a summary of the day’s earlier events, put together by the inimitable Andrew Sparrow.His positivity is perhaps unsurprising, given that we already know he’s backed the deal, but the business secretary Greg Clark has this to say:The Financial Times’ chief political correspondent, Jim Pickard, has been hearing some whispers about the atmosphere in the room at Chequers today:More publicly, the Tories’ chief whip Julian Smith – the person responsible for party discipline – has tweeted:The pro-EU Conservative MP, Dominic Grieve, said there had been a recognition that businesses required frictionless trade which meant “we are going to follow EU rules”. He told BBC’s Newsnight:The EU have got to be persuaded that what we are asking them is possible for them within the framework of maintaining their own cohesion, that is clearly going to be a very important discussion.Grieve said a “no deal” Brexit would be “catastrophic for everybody’s wellbeing in this country, it would be a great disaster”.His party colleague, the veteran Eurosceptic Bill Cash, told the same programme the plans were “rather disturbing” and he was “deeply disappointed to say the least”. There are some aspects of it which do fit in to the red lines, but there are many others which raise a lot of very serious questions.The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, has denounced the deal as one that was supposed to end internal warring in the Tory but, though two years in the making, has only left a “split cabinet with a threadbare agreement that Brussels might reject”.The only reason Brexiters in the cabinet will have agreed to this position is that they trust the EU will reject it, Britain will crash out with no deal and they will blame Brussels.No one voted for this. The Brexit campaign claimed to be about taking back control – these plans would give Britain less of a say and less control. It would weaken Britain. This makes the need for the people to have the final say on the deal even more crucial.More reaction from business leaders – and it is of a similar flavour. The director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, says:For Brexit-weary businesses seeking clarity, this agreement brings hope of an end to months of disappointing Westminster in-fighting.We welcome the cabinet’s collective decision to prioritise trade and economic stability under the prime minister’s leadership. For business, there is strength in unity as the UK seeks to develop a new relationship with the EU.As Chambers of Commerce have repeatedly argued, the priority must be to deliver clear and unequivocal answers to the practical, real-world questions businesses face. That remains the key test for the intense and complex negotiations that lie ahead.Stephen Martin, the director general of the influential lobby group Institute of Directors, has a similar take to Fairbairn, saying “business has been waiting” and will now welcome the relative certainty on offer. But the news is not all good.Our members have wanted cabinet to come together and put the interest of the country first, so firms across the UK will see this as a positive step forward. Today’s agreement, however, is not the end of the negotiations, and there is still much work to be done to reach agreement with the European Union. Time is still very much of the essence.The more clarity we have on the future trading relationship, the easier it will be for business to plan ahead. We hope today will turn quickly into progress in negotiations, and clarity for business on the path ahead.Overall, he welcomed the government’s newly adopted approach as “sensible”.More reports of Tory backbench unrest – from both sides – are coming in:And that does seem to be the initial reaction of the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who has said:The director-general of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, believes business will “welcome the fact the government has reached agreement”. She says:This is a genuine confidence boost and the prime minister deserves credit for delivering a unified approach.Initial signs suggest the proposal is based on the evidence firms have provided on the impact on jobs and living standards. That is good news – particularly the free trade area for goods, which the CBI and its members have long called for.The hard work starts now and time is a challenge. It has taken two years for the UK to agree its position we now have two months to agree it with Europe. But it’s a good starting point.And she called on EU leaders to approach the UK government’s proposals with an “open mind and flexibility”, focusing on jobs and economic growth for both sides.It seems neither the remain camp, nor the hard Brexiters in the Tory party are particularly happy with the terms the government will seek.The Labour MP, Chuka Umunna, a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign for a referendum on the Brexit deal, says the plan “doesn’t resolve many of the fundamental problems created by Brexit”.No one should be in any doubt: the proposal on offer from the government would represent a bad deal for our country, will create huge added bureaucracy and costs for business, and is highly unlikely to be accepted by the EU. However anyone voted in the 2016 referendum, they should be furious at this government stitch-up.This only confirms how important it is that we have a people’s vote on whatever botched Brexit deal the government comes up with, so the people of this country can decide whether or not it’s good enough.He says the government has reached this position “after two years of wasted time, and of big egos putting themselves ahead of the country”, calling it a “behind-closed-doors stitch up that would leave us all worse off”.On the other side of the ide, the hard Brexit-backing Conservative MP, Andrea Jenkyns, is equally dismissive:However, her Tory colleague Heidi Allen, who has backed a soft Brexit is – perhaps predictably – much happier with the news:Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has cast doubt on Theresa May’s capacity to get the agreement she has struck with her cabinet past the rest of her party.It is farcical that it has taken two years for the cabinet to even attempt to agree a position on the basics of our future relationship with the EU. On previous form, whatever has apparently been agreed will struggle to survive contact with Tory MPs and members.This looks like a sticking plaster rather than the government’s final position. With just a matter of months of the negotiations left, Theresa May’s ability to deliver Brexit continues to be in doubt.As promised, we’re reactivating the live blog, now that we have the news that the prime minister has the approval of her cabinet colleagues to negotiate a soft Brexit deal with the EU.Your essential primer on that is here:On the basis that there is only so much excitement a man can take in one day, I’m heading home.But if or when we get any news, a colleague will re-activate the blog."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/389132a5e5476a8c45c442f21d549fa70274b44d/344_649_6301_3781/master/6301.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fbe5d9bd157a300f3c961ca7dd31c2d","title":"the rochdale estate lower falinge welfare ghetto image","story":"Lower Falinge residents say media’s negative portrayal of area has been damagingAnn Doherty moved into her three-bedroom flat on Rochdale’s Lower Falinge estate in 1970, when it was built. Then aged 23 with a three-year-old son, she had been forced to leave her two-up two-down house on the other side of the town centre when it was condemned as unsafe.Doherty is now 72 and she’s still there. “It was heaven coming here,” she says, sitting in her sunny front room. “It felt brilliant because we didn’t have a bath in the old house or an inside toilet. Everything here was perfectly decorated. It was so lovely.”There are housing estates like the one Doherty has called home for nearly half a century all over the country: the same pebble-dashed walls, paved paths and neat lawns. But somehow, over the years, Lower Falinge has come to represent something much more complicated.While locals insisted the figures were warped by the exclusion of parts of the estate with a higher number of owner-occupiers, and by the high level of hostel accommodation nearby, other media organisations jumped on the story. The following day the  published an article with the headline: “Rush-hour silence in a welfare ghetto”.From then on, as the area continued to top lists measuring levels of deprivation, the estate became a symbol of poverty, poor-quality housing and inequality. Photos started to crop up in all kinds of contexts, often in stories with no connection to Lower Falinge at all. In 2014, an article in the Independent with the headline: “England’s poorest will live nine years less than the richest, according to stark new ONS stats”, was illustrated with a picture of the estate. A 2015 New Statesman piece on myths about inequality was too. In 2016, the national media descended on Lower Falinge again, when David Cameron announced that “sink estates” could be demolished to make way for new homes. Although he did not mention it by name, journalists and photographers looking for an example of a “sink estate” outside of London once again arrived in droves, further establishing its status as a stock image of poverty.“Millions of ‘just managing’ families are on the edge of poverty – report warns”, reads a 2017 headline in the Express, accompanied by an image taken on an overcast day. The same image appears alongside the Sky News headline from the same year “‘Divisive’ white working-class label is ‘all talk’”. A list of landlord Tory MPs who voted against making properties “fit for human habitation” in the International Business Times and a piece in Prospect magazine about the benefits cap were similarly illustrated. Many  stories have featured images of Lower Falinge, too, including a recent story about the lack of funding for social housing in the north of England. But for many residents, these depictions do not fit with the image they have of where they live. “Every estate has its problems, no matter where you go, but they always seem to pick on us,” says Doherty. “We’re just normal people, wanting to get on with each other.”Andy Littlewood was chair of the Lower Falinge tenants and residents association when the media frenzy hit in 2016. “We’ve had to put in a lot of work to undo the harm that the press has done to us,” he says.The effect of the estate’s reputation on residents is wide-ranging, he says. Many will not tell potential employers where they live for fear it will put them off. “They just say they live in Rochdale because they’ve been turned down from jobs that they thought they had a good chance of getting when they’ve written Lower Falinge as their address.” Littlewood says the impact on younger people growing up on the estate is particularly potent. “The kids are fed up of being told they’re nothing,” he says. “If you tell a vulnerable person enough times that they’re scum, that they live on a sink estate and that they’re thick, eventually it’ll mess with their heads and they’ll start to believe it.”Littlewood does not dispute that many people on the estate are out of work – he is unable to work because of epilepsy – but is studying part-time for a degree in maths and computing from the Open University. The amount of employment and support allowance paid out per person on the estate is three times the average for the borough of Rochdale as a whole. And although Littlewood admits “it’s not perfect”, he says he loves Lower Falinge.Andrew Johnson, who lives in neighbouring College Bank – a group of tower blocks that can often be seen in the background of pictures of Lower Falinge – agrees. “It’s really handy,” he says. “I’m literally a two-minute walk from the town centre with supermarkets on my doorstep. It isn’t chaos, hopelessness and despair.”Marie Kelly, 37, is one of a small group of residents who spend their spare time tending to the estate’s community garden. On an implausibly hot day, she proudly gives a tour of the flower beds, which have produced, among other things, strawberries, purple sprouting broccoli, lettuce, carrots, beans, onions and potatoes. Kelly sees working on the garden as a kind of therapy. “I suffer with some mental health issues and it gives me something to focus on,” she says. For Clare Tostevin, the director of growth at Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH) – a tenant and employee co-owned mutual housing society that runs the estate – there is a wider problem with the way tenants of social housing are presented.“We need to think about how we change that narrative, because areas of social housing are full of people getting on with their lives just like all of us,” she says. “There’s this idea that if you’re in social housing you’re desperate, you’re needy, it’s your last resort, and that’s just not the case.”Although Tostevin is highly critical of the language used in Cameron’s sink estate announcement, the initiative provided RBH with £560,000 of funding to draw up regeneration plans for the estate. The proposals include the refurbishment of 10 blocks on Lower Falinge and the replacement of 15. Four in seven of the neighbouring College Bank tower blocks are in line for demolition, with new townhouses planned to replace them. Many residents are hostile to the move – upset they will lose their homes – a fact Tostevin says demonstrates that the estate is loved by those who live there.A new set of photographs have been taken now, this time on a sunny day, and they tell a different story. And even if the change is a wrench, it is welcomed by some. Doherty’s block is one of those earmarked for demolition. Although she will miss her home hugely, she is looking forward to moving into a more accessible ground-floor flat. “The estate has changed a lot over the years,” she says. “When we were young we would never throw rubbish on the floor or do anything like that, but there are still loads of lovely people here. “I’m not ashamed to say I come from here. I’ve never been ashamed to say I come from Lower Falinge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c86df3119d3741a0bdba5817a9e9b59cc207f7df/0_7_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e75382a2e68f61243ecf2b789eb3016b","title":"lewis hamilton ride wave chase records british grand prix","story":"If the four-times world champion wins for the sixth time at Silverstone on Sunday he would set new marks for total and consecutive victories in his home raceHe may now be considered one of the elder statesmen of Formula One but for Lewis Hamilton some moments retain their magic even 12 years into a remarkably successful career.The British Grand Prix is one of them and the driver who wears his heart on his sleeve returns to Silverstone once more revelling in being able to perform in front of his home crowd.They share his passion, his emotion and his commitment, as do his Mercedes team, who value these traits for all that it can mean he is a handful to manage. They believe Hamilton has another five years at the top of F1 in him and want him to see them out at Mercedes.Since he made his debut at the track in 2007 Hamilton has made his love of Silverstone clear and this year the four-times world champion has the chance to secure his place in the annals of a grand prix that has been on the F1 calendar since the championship began in 1950. He won for the first time at Silverstone in 2008, a magnificent performance in the wet for McLaren and has taken the flag for the past four years with Mercedes. A fifth consecutive victory would beat Jim Clark’s run of four and his sixth win would surpass Clark and Alain Prost’s record of five.He was 22 when he first took to the windswept former airfield and promptly made his mark with pole position. Since that exceptional rookie season, he has never looked back but the British Grand Prix will always be special.“It’s been a really incredible journey since 2007,” he said. “Just to be riding this positive wave every time you come to this grand prix. I’m really grateful to be in the position to fight for a win at Silverstone for the sixth time. Not many drivers get to do that. So I’m very privileged in that respect.”It has been some journey. He has 65 wins, second only to Michael Schumacher, but it has not always been smooth. Hamilton is demanding on himself, and others. Even at the previous race in Austria his frustration with the team over a poor strategy call was obvious to all. But Mercedes would have it no other way.The team principal, Toto Wolff, was clear this was the price you pay for such a rare talent. “You need a lion in the car that is giving it everything. The best ones are also sensitive,” he said. “Exceptional iniduals you just have to accept they have strong opinions, views and a strong drive. That determination to win and that ambition in a situation is not an easy character trait to deal with. But it is just what we want in the team. The super nice, polite guy is not what we want. We want the guy that scores the tries and wins the trophies, so I embrace high maintenance.”The team are in the process of re-signing their contract with the 33-year-old, for what is expected to be a two-year deal. Hamilton has made it clear he wants to pursue other interests when he retires, music and fashion among them, but Wolff believes he still has more to come in F1.“I think he has another five very good years in him,” said Wolff, who wants them to be with Mercedes. “If in two years’ time we still feel the same about each other, have trust, I think it would be clear that we continue.” Hamilton is in a tight fight for the title with Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who leads the championship by one point. The pair have three wins apiece, their cars are evenly matched and the advantage has swapped between them with an ebb and flow that has made predicting the outcome impossible. The lead has changed hands five times in nine races.The season will likely be decided by tiny margins and the relationship between team and driver is going to be vital. Wolff describes Hamilton as a “creative” talent and explains his role is to ensure he nurtures the best from his driver. He also stresses that one of Hamilton’s key strengths is that he is brutally honest with himself. A trait he has displayed since he was racing for Frédéric Vasseur’s ART team in GP2 in 2006.“Frédéric Vasseur told me that when Lewis was in GP2 he was the only young driver that when he got out of the car said: ‘You don’t need to look at the data as my driving was not good’. He still does the same today,” Wolff said.Mercedes have won the last four drivers’ and constructors’ championships but Wolff describes the fight with Ferrari as “the biggest challenge we have had so far”. Hamilton is at the sharp end of that task and it is one that will likely go to the wire but at this particular moment at Silverstone he is just enjoying sharing his passion with the fans he loves.“As the years go on, you appreciate the support more and more,” he said. “2007 was already pretty cool and then 2008, I really will never forget that day. I hope I can wave the flag for a little bit longer.”His weekend opened with the positive start he would have wanted. Hamilton topped the time sheets in first practice in front of his teammate Valtteri Bottas, with Vettel in third, half a second back.In the afternoon session, Vettel was on top with Hamilton second just 0.187sec behind and Bottas third. Mercedes had expected to be strong and the thinner tread on the tyres being used this weekend certainly suits their cars.Hamilton dominated and won at the last two races at which they were used in Spain and France. On this form, a sixth pole at his home grand prix on Sunday looks well within his grasp."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2057ebaf6b28e4c535dfc7158fe1ffc2fac17a5/190_313_2522_1513/master/2522.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e445b72e2e5845c8472eecb0f786239","title":"meet the makers behind some of londons top market stalls","story":"From pork loins to concrete planters – traders at the capital’s fourth Urban Village Fete in Greenwich share their passions and productsThe Greenwich peninsula is undergoing a transformation from concrete jungle to a buzzing design and creative space. To celebrate this, each year the peninsula springs to life with music, colour and dancing, as creators from all over London come together for the Urban Village Fete. Curated by Wayne Hemingway, co-founder of Hemingway Design, the event delivers his vision of recreating the type of free festival that once attracted some of the brightest creative minds to Camden and Kensington markets.“Free festivals were the way we communicated,” he says. “There were loads of young designers who went on to become pretty famous. We want to recreate that in Greenwich: getting young creatives in front of tens of thousands of people at a price they can afford.”The fete is now in its fourth year and stretches through an area that is becoming a hub for design. Hemingway hopes that with 15,000 new homes, plus spaces designated for work and play, a sense of creativity and community will blossom on the peninsula, with creatives sharing the area with families. “The event feels generous, and generosity should be a part of urban life,” he says.Hemingway’s company produces dozens of festivals around the UK each year – from Liverpool’s Fine Tuned event to the National Festival of Making in Blackburn. One challenge facing market traders and craftspeople across these events is that shoppers are carrying less cash than ever. Hemingway Design and payments platform Square partnered to equip cash-only traders with Square Readers so they could take cards, many of them for the first time. Here, we meet some of the dozens of makers and creators who brought the Greenwich fete to life. Emily Griffin lives and breathes east London’s creative scene. A Hackney local for 20 years, during the past three she’s built her homewares and accessories business Mahala from the ground up. But while she makes and designs most of what can be found inside her store, the brand is also a family affair. “My husband joined Mahala a year ago and designs the clothes, which we have made in Bow,” says Griffin. “His aunt has a small orchard, so she makes all the lovely oils for us.” Mahala’s clothes and accessories are made to endure, reflecting the family’s thrifty past. Griffin uses military canvas and saddlery to create her bags, and her designs are centred around slow fashion. “I want people to have them for a really long time. I always repair stuff – I’d rather repair than replace,” she says.Building relationships with her customers at events such as the Urban Village Fete is key. “It means we’re not relying on footfall on our street, which is really quiet. Plus, we get to meet people from all over London and farther afield,” she says. The concrete planters found at From the Land (formerly Conpot) are far from the rigid grey slabs the material usually brings to mind. Architect Alastair Mitchell and textile designer Kezia Regan began experimenting in their home with planters made from concrete, before expanding to homewares and surfaces. “Each one uses a different stone source from around the country – Shropshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire – so we’re trying to show that concrete can have all these regional dialects,” says Mitchell.As the business grows, he says the aim is to move away from third-party retailers and sell more through his online store and specialist ceramic fairs, and at events like the Urban Village Fete. To do this, and to make the most of footfall, he has started using cashless payment platform Square. “If you only take cash, most people go away and never come back,” he says. “Just the other day we had someone come to our house who wanted to buy a planter. We were able to take a card payment in our living room.”Sarah Harvey, UK lead for Square, says: “None of us want to have to walk away from a unique item on a market stall just because that trader won’t accept cards, and with our partnership we wanted to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to support independent and creative businesses.” Ayse Özden loves creating with paper. She is one of the founders of WeAct, a London-based stationery store and brand agency with its roots in Turkey. “Greeting cards are a very big thing in Europe, whereas in Istanbul they’re not,” she says. Her family made the move to bring their collections to London two years ago. Her stall at the Urban Village Fete was filled with quirky designs from dictionary clippings underlying colourful illustrations designed by her husband to comical faces splashed across greeting cards and notebook covers. “There’s been a really nice response to the face collection,” she says. “Lots of people are laughing and that was our aim – to help people have fun.” Before making bespoke, one-of-a-kind bags to sell exclusively at markets, Anna P was designing 250-piece collections twice a year for high-street stores. Now she works for herself, and has spent three years collecting vintage textiles that she uses to design and make leather and cloth bags by hand. The designer prefers to sell to people direct, and doesn’t have an online store. Because of the nomadic nature of her stall, she makes sure she has a cashless payment system whenever she’s selling at markets. “I use Square and it’s so quick to take payments – if you have a lot of people and they all want to buy at the same time, just tap it on there and it’s done,” she says.  The bright pops of colour coming from the Keeler \u0026amp Sidaway stall captured the Urban Village Fete’s sunny, holiday vibes. Joe Keeler began his print and stationery company two years ago, as a way of combining his loves of illustration, photography and travelling – the latter of which inspires his art, which often features Californian poolsides and graphic beaches.“I’m an avid photographer, so I’ll take loads of photos and come back and draw from them, or sketch scenes while I’m on location and then work it all together from there,” he says.With a studio based in Bermondsey, Keeler sells his prints through his online store, but makes an exception when it comes to the urban village fete. “This one is the best summery festival things to do in London,” he says. “There are lots of people here.” Visitors to Imogen Johnson-Gilbert’s stall could try on her first collection, made at a Fairtrade factory in Bangalore, a new milestone for her business. Previously, Johnson-Gilbert made all of the Gillian June clothes herself, but the business’s popularity has made that tricky. “We’ve grown to a point where I’ve stopped being able to make it all,” she says.  Isabelle Laight really loves hip-hop, and at the Urban Village Fete she found she was in good company. “You can see everyone being really surprised when they walk past. It’s one of those things you don’t see that often,” she says of her illustrated designs of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB greats on the sides of mugs, plates, and stationery. “Kanye is the most popular. I don’t want him to be, but he is,” says Laight. “My favourite at the moment is Tupac – I’m going through a bit of a phase.” Using Square for payments at the fete, Laight says: “It’s really easy, I just keep it in my pocket, and there’s been no need to troubleshoot because I haven’t had any problems.” Sheffield native Alastair Mason knows a thing or two about pork. “It’s always been a family tradition that we have our pork brined or dipped by the butcher,” he says of his favourite snack. Mason started the Salty Loins food truck in 2015 through sheer frustration: he was unable to get a “decent” pork sandwich in London. “After raving to my friends about not being able to find this kind of pork, I decided to take it upon myself to experiment and came up with my own brine recipe.”Since then, the trained graphic designer has been a staple at London markets such as Maltby Street and Borough, as well as on the Bermondsey “beer mile”. Mason’s menu has expanded to incorporate one of his hometown’s favourite dishes – chips and gravy – plus baby back salt ribs, which he cooks up in front of hungry punters. “It’s good theatre when you’ve got a street food stall, obviously. That and the smell is key to people coming in and trying something new,” he says.Cathryn Quail’s stall on the peninsula looked straight out of the pages of a trendy interiors magazine – but she wants plants to be a part of a sustainable lifestyle rather than feeding an expensive trend. She opened The Botanical Workshop last September to sell plants and teach people how to arrange and take care of them. “It should be something that is affordable, that brings you joy and helps with mindfulness,” she says. “When you buy plants and they stay alive, it’s way more sustainable.”To curb the frustration generated by his bureaucratic job, where he was stuck at a desk each day, Ross Mitchell started curing food. Over three years, his hobby grew to become a business, now called Smoke and Cure. This was his first gig at the Urban Village Fete. “It is always good to meet a new bunch of customers. We were sitting right next to the music stage and among other peer businesses, so we were in good company,” he says.Mitchell has also learned that catering for card payments is now a necessity. “A year ago I wasn’t too fussed about using them, but what I found is it absolutely opens up a whole new line of business,” he says. “With Square you’re allowed to take payment over the phone, which is becoming increasingly important for our particular business.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ae969f2f1e60a4dd5dd259e803f03428d873ac5/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e4adb5dae62fcb76f914d6bb20490d8","title":"mike pompeo north kroea visit pressure nuclear progress","story":"Secretary of state predicts ‘productive’ meeting on his third visit, joking: ‘If I come one more time, I will have to pay taxes here’Talks between senior US and North Korean officials in Pyongyang over disarmament and improving bilateral relations entered a second day on Saturday with a testy exchange between the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo and his counterpart, Kim Yong-chol.Pompeo and a US delegation are in North Korea in an effort to persuade the regime to take concrete steps that Donald Trump claimed he was promised by Kim Jong-un in Singapore on 12 June. He has said the North Korean leader said he would destroy a missile engine testing site and then organise the repatriation of remains of US soldiers killed in the Korean war. Pompeo is also asking for more substantial steps towards disarmament, reportedly including an inventory of the North Korean arsenal of warheads and missiles.Early on Saturday morning, Pompeo left the Pyongyang guesthouse where the US delegation is staying to make a call through secure communications to Trump at his New Jersey golf club. The national security advisor, John Bolton, and the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, also took part in the call. Pompeo briefed them on his initial round of talks on Friday with Kim Yong-chol, a former spy chief and vice chair of the ruling party. As well as a working session on Friday, the two men had dinner, which the state department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, described as “relationship building”. Nauert said that at times they were “cracking jokes” and “exchanging pleasantries.”She said that progress had been made in Friday’s discussions, adding that the talks had covered the process of denuclearisation and the repatriation of American remains. She added: “we expect them to live up to their commitments.” The two also established working groups to deal with what Nauert described as the “nitty gritty stuff” of outstanding issues between the two countries.She said Pompeo had been “very firm” in seeking three basic goals: complete denuclearization of North Korea, security assurances, and the repatriation of remains.When Pompeo returned to the guesthouse after phoning on Saturday, Kim asked Pompeo how he had slept, adding: “we did have very serious discussion on very important matters yesterday. So thinking about those discussions you might have not slept well last night.”“Director Kim I slept just fine,” Pompeo replied. He went on to point the importance of their task of implementing what Trump and Kim agreed in Singapore and set off on the “the path toward complete denuclearisation”.“Of course it is important,” Kim said, but added: “There are things that I have to clarify.”Pompeo replied: “There are things that I have to clarify as well.”The secretary of state is under time pressure to produce results by August, when the US and South Korea were due to hold joint military exercises. Those exercises were cancelled on Trump’s orders in Singapore as an up-front concession. Adding to the pressure, the president has repeatedly claimed that the testing site has already been destroyed, and that the soldiers’ remains have been sent back, neither of which has happened.Trump has also made extravagant claims about what was agreed in Singapore. At a rally in Montana on Thursday, he claimed: “We signed a wonderful paper saying they’re going to denuclearise their whole thing. It’s going to all happen.”In a joint statement with Trump, Kim agreed to move towards “complete denuclearisation” but that has been a stock phrase in North Korean rhetoric since 1992 and signifies a vague and long-term process of multilateral disarmament on the Korean peninsula. Since the Singapore meeting, satellite images and intelligence leaks have suggested that North Korea is upgrading critical parts of its nuclear programme. “Our leaders made commitments at the Singapore summit on the complete denuclearisation of North Korea and outlined what a transformed US-DPRK relationship could look like,” Pompeo said on his way to Pyongyang.Even while Pompeo has been in Pyongyang, new satellite pictures were published by the website 38 North, showing work had been completed on the cooling plant for a new nuclear reactor.  Unnamed US intelligence officials also concluded that North Korea does not intend to completely give up its nuclear stockpile.In Pyongyang on Friday, Pompeo met Kim Yong-chol, North Korea’s former spy chief and vice-chair of the ruling party, in an extensive guest house in Pyongyang, close to a vast mausoleum where North Korea’s former leaders, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, are buried.Welcoming Pompeo and the US team to the first session of talks, Kim Yong-chol, said: “The more you come, more trust we can build between one another.”“Today’s meeting is a really meaningful meeting,” the 73-year-old general said.Pompeo replied: “Yes, I agree I look forward to it and I count on it being very productive.”Noting it was his third visit to Pyongyang, he joked: “If I come one more time, I will have to pay taxes here.”Earlier, Pompeo laughed but did not reply to a question about a South Korean report that he had brought a CD of Elton John’s Rocket Man, as a gift for Kim Jong-un. “Rocket Man” was the nickname Trump gave to Kim when tensions between the two countries reached a peak last year. The meeting lasted two hours and 45 minutes and Pompeo then had dinner with his senior aides. The next session is due to start at 9am. It is unclear whether Pompeo will meet Kim Jong-un on this trip. There were reports before Pompeo began his visit, that he might relax the US demand for complete, verifiable, irreversible disarmament (CVID), and settle for mutual confidence-building measures that defused tensions without dismantling the North Korean arsenal.His spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, denied those reports on Thursday, saying: “Nothing could be further from the truth. Our policy toward North Korea has not changed. “We are committed to a denuclearised North Korea and Secretary Pompeo looks forward to continuing his consultations with North Korean leaders to follow up on the commitments made at the Singapore summit,” Nauert added. However, she did explain why Pompeo and other US officials had stopped using the CVID formulation in their remarks. Pompeo will also use his trip to consult and reassure Washington’s allies in the region, with meetings planned with Japanese and South Korean officials in Tokyo on Sunday. Japan has voiced support for the leaders’ Singapore declaration, but reacted cautiously to Trump’s decision to cancel joint military exercises."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/735b6baab21ebebb46514e92cb299d2f6e4348d0/0_37_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88944b2729ea80508fafac144ce4cb7d","title":"easy does it the slow travel guide to the peloponnese greece","story":"The majestic peninsula is home to local tavernas, picturesque villages, ancient sites and stunning stretches of coast. Best of all, it’s delightfully unhurried and free of overhyped hotspotsThe Peloponnese, southern Greece’s much-mythologised peninsula, has something of a reputation for philoxenia – the tradition of giving a warm welcome and showing generous hospitality to visitors. It’s also a region that embodies the very ideal of slow travel: local food and drink, plenty of walking, zero stress, tapping ancient rhythms and community spirit.Of course, this comes from the people. But it may also have to do with vital statistics. The peninsula is about the size of Wales, yet receives only a small percentage of tourists in comparison to the big beasts of Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Halkidiki and others. This means there’s no need to jostle among crowds.A topography of indented coasts, river valleys, steep mountain ranges and small coastal peninsulas encourages rural integrity over road-building. In hundreds of small villages, local ties are strong, there are festivals aplenty, and life revolves around farming and fishing, family and friends – and, naturally, local tavernas.Even the staples are sybaritic, from the famous Kalamata olives and green-gold oil to purple-hued tsakoniki aubergines to barrel-aged feta cheese. Wine grapes have been grown across the sun-baked slopes for centuries.For all its old-world charm, the Peloponnese is also a land of almost unlimited scope for exploration. It’s home to some of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, including Olympia and Ancient Messini, as well as many others lesser-known but no less enthralling. Much of Greece’s mythology originated here, including the main players of the Trojan wars.If you want relaxation, this unique part of Greece delivers in spades. Get the inside track on the must-visit villages, beaches and beauty spots, for the ultimate go-slow break in the Peloponnese ...Mani, the second finger at the southern tip of the Peloponnese and, by extension, mainland Greece itself, is one of the most beautiful regions in the country, with a mountainous spine running down to what were – until relatively recently – some very remote spots. The sun rises late on the coast because of the high Taygetos mountain range. Mornings tend to be lazy affairs where locals and visitors mingle to enjoy leisurely coffees and late breakfasts.It is also home to the pretty town of Kardamili. This laid-back little place is wonderful for walkers planning to hike the Viros gorge ditto for birdwatchers, artists and writers – little wonder that Patrick Leigh Fermor chose this village to be his home. The small beach resort of Stoupa is just a few miles to the south.Eat and drinkAll the local eateries are traditional family-run tavernas – as authentic a Greek culinary experience as you’ll find anywhere.  Kiki’s Taverna, up a side street from the town square, does dishes of the day rather than a set menu – favourites include sea bream and goat’s meat – ensuring produce is fresh and seasonal. It’s really traditional and popular with locals. If you want a stunning view with your meal, try Dioskouri Taverna, which overlooks the little harbour of Kardamili, for a fresh fish and sunset combination. It also sells local sea salt, olive soap and honey.StayThe Liakoto and Anniska hotels are on the sea front with the Taygetos range behind – Kardamili is blessed by both sea and mountain scenery. Anniska has a more traditional look and feel, with a stunning terrace where breakfast is served and drinks flow all day. Liakoto has sea-view rooms with private balconies overlooking the magnificent Messinian Bay. Both hotels have a very high number of repeat guests.This away-from-it-all haven is at the start of a string of fine, sandy beaches, culminating in the fantastic lagoon-like curve of Voidokilia in the heart of the nature reserve here – with wetlands excellent for birding. Close by is the historic town of Pylos, where the naval battle of Navarino was fought in 1827, during the Greek war of independence.Eat and drinkThere is an extensive choice of tavernas and cafes, which are really only busy at weekends and in peak season, when the locals from Pylos come for a swim and a fish lunch. Elia does superb salads, aromatic grilled sardines, and octopus with capers.StayZoe Resort’s 20 attractive studios and apartments have a large swimming pool and gardens leading down to the beach. Or you could opt to stay in the older – but no less charming – 24-room Zoe hotel.This historic town is known for the imposing walls of its Venetian fortress, which stretch out towards the sea. It’s very sleepy spot, with a wide sandy beach shelving very gently into shallow waters.Eat and drinkThe Klimataria restaurant is very well regarded, and eating out in the garden courtyard is a reason to visit in itself. Chicken in mustard sauce is delicious, as are the grilled veggies.StayThe Ulysses hotel, a small and friendly lodging with just nine rooms, is great for the beach. Breakfast is excellent and the hotel makes its own fresh lemonade – perfect for kicking off the morning. The Markopouloses, who own the Ulysses, are a mine of information and treat their guests as one of the family.The stunning, rugged hamlet of Gerolimenas, at the head of a fjord-like inlet, was once a busy trading post now it’s a nostalgic post-boom village, and comprises a mere handful of stone houses, a couple of tavernas and a beach.Eat and drinkThe fish – guaranteed fresh – is excellent here. Head for the harbour and you won’t go wrong.StayIf you want remote coupled with contemporary boutique-style comfort, a stay at the Kyrimai hotel should suit. Converted from a 19th-century warehouse, with sea to three sides, the hotel has a standout restaurant, and you can plunge directly from its jetty into the clearest of seas. Recommended for couples more than families, this is definitely one for romantic getaways.Find last-minute summer holiday deals at sunviloffers.

The crowd gathered around a big screen as downtown Rio buzzed with anticipation. And then came the own goal from Fernandinho, and Kevin De Bruyne’s follow-up – and the crowd fell into a horrible silence. Was this going to go horribly wrong again? Brazil always wants to win the World Cup. But today’s Brazil – politically polarized, ground down by recession, with its most popular leader in recent decades in jail, and an extreme rightwinger leading polls for October’s presidential election – yearned for victory despite – or because of its many problems.And yet after Friday’s 2-1 defeat, there was less of the wailing, gnashing of teeth and black humour that followed Brazil’s shock 7-1 defeat to Germany in 2014’s semi-final. Just a sense that people were taking stock.“Brazil eliminated from the cup with an own goal is very representative of the current national crisis,” Maurício Santoro, a professor of international relations at Rio de Janeiro State University, posted on his Facebook.“It is a really bad feeling. Brazil did not play as well as they could,” said Marcos Cordolino, 50, a civil servant watching the match on Benjamin Constant Street in Rio. “Our stars failed to shine,” he said.Brazil has won the World Cup five times, but its relationship with the tournament has grown cooler in recent years.The country hosted the 2014 tournament just a year after huge street demonstrations targeting graft and spending on stadiums. The economy had stopped growing, and the cracks were appearing in the success story of a country once heralded for combining economic growth and social progress.After that, everything seemed to go wrong: a multi-billion dollar graft scandal a Zika epidemic rising violent crime and an army takeover of crumbling security services in Rio de Janeiro the impeachment of leftist president Dilma Rousseff, and her replacement by her even less popular vice-president, the rightwinger Michel Temer.This time interest built up even more slowly than four years ago, with some Brazilians even supporting archrivals Argentina. But the team gave some reason for hope under coach Adenor Bacchi, known as “Tite”, who appeared to provide the managerial expertise his country’s notoriously corrupt and widely-despised political leaders lack. “We always expect to win the cup,” said Tadeu Prieto, 32, an IT technician. Even so, the crowd spilling down the steps in front of the big screen on Benjamin Constant street was about half the size of four years ago, when games were also shown here.Brazil’s deepening political ides were on show too. Engineer Camila Leonçio, 33, was wearing a blue Brazil shirt because the iconic yellow team shirts were adopted by rightwing demonstrators calling for Rousseff’s exit, and the country’s flag was waved by those calling for military intervention during May’s national truck strike. Regina Horge, 32, a kitchen assistant, had – like many leftists – gone one step further and wore a red Brazil shirt with a lapel flag. “People are not excited. The 7-1 was wrong and the social issue is very bad,” she said.At half time, with Brazil two-nil down, the crowd held onto expectations. “I am very hopeful,” said Joelma Saldanha, 38, a lab technician wearing a T-shirt whose slogan, loosely translated, read: “It’s just a game, your ass.” She explained: “It’s not just a game. It’s Brazil, playing for a better world.”And yet, things kept going wrong. During national anthems before kick-off, the big screen failed, forcing people to crowd around a small television set balanced on a nearby speaker - an emblematic moment for a broken country trying to work out how to fix itself. It did not start working again until the second half, just as Brazil started playing properly.After the final whistle, people milled around the streets. Yet there was no sense of the desperation some Brazilians remember from past failures, like 1982 – when Brazil’s most creative team was eliminated by Italy. Julia Mayer, 32, sat on a stool scrolling through her cellphone messages. “Now Brazil has to worry about other things like health and education. The struggle continues,” she said.On a nearby street music was already booming from a house party and four women discussed the game as they walked by. “For Brazil to have won this cup would have been an embarrassment. The last cup destroyed our country,” said Estella Resende, 42, a kitchen assistant. And then – like Brazil – the women moved on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6440da187891e216a154339d79718ae52df620ff/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1cd910c1f15f8a6a6520e4a4c4d5e11","title":"el licenciado sinaloa damaso lopez extradited","story":"Former lieutenant of Joaquín ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán faces charges of conspiring to distribute cocaine and commit money launderingMexican drug boss Dámaso López – who unleashed a bloody wave of violence when he tried and failed to take over the Sinaloa cartel – has been extradited from the border city of Ciudad Juárez to the US. Known by his alias “El Licenciado”, which is a title for college graduates, Lopez was a former lieutenant of Sinaloa kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán and helped him escape from a Mexican prison in 2001. But after Guzmán’s arrest in 2016, he started a bloody battle with the capo’s sons for control of the cartel, entering into an alliance with the upstart Jalisco New Generation cartel and triggering a wave of violence in the Pacific coast states of Sinaloa and Baja California.López faces US charges of conspiring to distribute cocaine and commit money laundering and could face life imprisonment if convicted.López was arrested at an apartment building in Mexico City in 2017.By then, his wing of the drug cartel appeared to collapse, and his son, Dámaso López Serrano, turned himself in at the US-Mexico border, becoming the highest-ranking member of a Mexican cartel to surrender to US authorities.The son pleaded guilty to drug smuggling charges, saying he orchestrated the shipments of thousands of pounds of methamphetamine, cocaine and heroin to the United States.The Sinaloa cartel is often described as a horizontal confederation of crime leaders in which Guzmán was seen as the ultimate authority to referee internal disputes.With Guzmán in jail, control of the organisation has passed between Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García and Rafael Caro Quintero, two of the most traditional, old-school capos, as well as López and Guzmán’s sons, Iván Archivaldo Guzmán and Jesús Alfredo Guzmán Salazar.Guzmán was extradited to the United States in 2017 to face drug trafficking, money laundering and other charges. He has pleaded not guilty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c8eaf3467c81b8e655ed912b12a3b3f9411a9e/33_158_2447_1468/master/2447.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbbd9a3098275285d1e9a7e3b7169098","title":"german students reveal exam answers to key brexit questions","story":"Pupils who sat Brexit test say decision to leave EU ‘sounds naive’ and Northern Ireland should vote againHow can the Brexit negotiations move on from the deadlock over the Irish border? According to a group of German students who have sat the first school exam on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, the answer could be straightforward: give Northern Ireland a referendum on whether to stay in the UK or the EU.In April, students of English in the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg were asked as part of their school-leaving exams to write about the differences between the hopes connected to Britain’s EU referendum and the reality of Brexit so far.Now that the Abitur – the certificate of general qualification for university entrance, equivalent to the UK’s A-levels – papers have been marked, some students have revealed some of the creative solutions they came up with.“If I understand it correctly, the conflict with the border is there because Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU,” said Daniel Boppert, 19, a student at the Lessing gymnasium in Karlsruhe, who scored 14 out of 15 points in the written English test.“Now they need a special solution. Perhaps they should have another referendum, but only for those in Northern Ireland, to see if they want to stay in the EU or in the UK under the new conditions after Brexit.”The dispute over the Irish border has proved one of the main sticking points of the Brexit negotiations. Any UK ergence from EU regulations – a key boon for many Brexit advocates – risks creating a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and unravelling the peace process.Boppert said that although he had some sympathy with the Brexit vote, “I don’t really understand it. I can see how the sovereignty idea has some appeal, but surely you can’t get around the fact that the economy will take a hit in the coming years. I don’t know if perhaps Boris Johnson had a special appeal, but it all sounds very naive to me.”His classmate Ole Ermel, 18, said it would be dangerous to revoke the referendum result and hold another UK-wide vote. “It would be absurd to simply void such an important democratic decision. Where would that lead to?” said Ermel, who scored 15 out of 15. “But perhaps they could have a vote only in Northern Ireland?”The exam, sat by about 31,000 students, asked for comment on a drawing by an Indian cartoonist, Paresh Nath, contrasting “Project Fantasy” – represented by a man in a bowler hat soaring to the sky on a UFO – with the realities of economic uncertainty and “job confusion”.“What I got from the cartoon was that the British people had a lot of hopes for Brexit, such as an upturn in the economy, and that these hopes haven’t really been fulfilled,” said Rebecca Gartner, 18. “Instead there has only been uncertainty.”David Blinov, 18, said: “I put that Brexit was a backward step for Europe. We have had 60 years of peace in Europe, and the EU has played an important role in that. Now the danger is that the EU as a whole could collapse.“I can see how people voted to leave because they felt patriotic, but I find patriotism pretty moronic,” he added. “If you happen to have been born in another country then you would have felt patriotic about that country. It’s so random.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d28faa13ebe504e3747c6688c90e1dfef48547/0_120_4297_2578/master/4297.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f013bd89a14d776b3f3ea00fb8eeaac6","title":"japan appetite eel same fate bluefin tuna","story":"Diners eat eel for an energy boost in summer, but its popularity has depleted stocksOversized inflatable plastic eels dangle from the ceiling of a supermarket in Tokyo as late afternoon shoppers inspect the real thing – beautifully packaged and prominently displayed – on the shelves below.In specialist restaurants run by generations of the same families, diners eat sweetened broiled eel, which is thought to take the edge off the heat and humidity of a Japanese summer.These annual rites are performed in honour of a dish that has been part of the culinary landscape for centuries. But Japan’s appetite for Anguilla japonica – Japanese freshwater eel – has come at a price.Eel stocks are a fraction of what they were in the 1960s, and conservationists say continued overconsumption could condemn the animal to the same fate as the Pacific bluefin tuna.The environment ministry designated the Japanese eel as an endangered species in 2013. The following year, the International Union of Conservation of Nature added it to its red list of threatened species, blaming overconsumption and environmental damage to the rivers and coastal areas where they spawn and grow.The plight of the eel has come into sharper focus as Japan prepares to mark the Day of the Ox in the lunar calendar – two days that this year fall on 20 July and 1 August – traditionally considered the hottest days of the year.Overfishing of juvenile glass eels, which are transferred to farm ponds where they are fed until they reach maturity, has led to record price rises, forcing restaurants to post notices apologising to customers for charging them significantly more each year for a simple kabayaki.The market price for adult eels rose to a record ¥5,300 (£36) a kg in March, about one and a half times higher than last year, according to the Union of Eel Farmers Cooperatives of Japan.The decline in stocks has been accelerated by illegal fishing, according to Kenzo Kaifu, a professor at Chuo University in Tokyo and an expert on eel conservation.The Day of the Ox, Kaifu said, “might be the perfect opportunity to think a little more deeply about the eel problem we’re facing, and make it a topic of conversation”.On those and other sweltering days throughout the midsummer, people are drawn to skewered fillets of eel that are dipped in a soy-based sweet sauce, cooked slowly over charcoal and served on rice.The dish, which is rich in vitamins, is eaten to provide a much-needed energy boost at the height of summer some believe the smoke from an eel cooking on the grill gives an immediate pick-me-up.Last month, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan agreed to leave the upper limit on catches of juvenile eels unchanged, to the dismay of conservation groups. China, which has the biggest single annual quota of 36 tons, much of which it exports to Japan, routinely shuns multinational efforts to restrict catches.Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora are expected to discuss the increasingly precarious future of the freshwater eel at a meeting next May.Some retailers are already taking action. The supermarket chain Aeon said it would stop procuring Japanese eels whose origin and journey through the supply chain was not properly documented. Instead it will switch to short-fin eels, a cheaper variety commonly found in Indonesia, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Some eel farmers are fattening their stocks so a single fish produces enough meat for two dishes, despite concerns that the bigger bones, which are usually barely perceptible, will put off some diners.Despite advances in farming methods, it is still not possible to raise eels from birth to maturity. Fisheries have to catch juvenile eels in the wild before transferring them to farm ponds.Campaigners are calling on consumers to resist the urge to eat Japanese eels this summer and throughout the year.“Even though there is a severe shortage, Japan, Taiwan, Korea have together decided not to reduce the catch quota next season,” said Kazue Komatsubara, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace Japan.“The fishery agency said there was no scientific evidence to support a reduction in catches. But Japan could reduce its catch quota by itself to help the eel population recover. It has to take responsibility as the biggest market for the Japanese eel.“The only way to avoid supporting illegal fishing and to be a responsible consumer who supports sustainable fishing is to stop buying eels.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3556901.1530911911!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"chequers document may be bold enough to start serious negotiation with brussels","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May speaks to members of her cabinet at the prime minister’s rural country residence, Chequers, west of London. Photograph: Joel RouseAFPGetty ImagesOn the face of it, much of what Theresa May’s cabinet agreed at Chequers is unworkable and unlikely to be accepted by the European Union. But the three-page document released after the day-long meeting represents an important political victory for the prime minister, who has faced down her Brexiteer ministers.The night before the Chequers meeting, seven of those ministers – led by Boris Johnson – met in the foreign office amid rumbles of outrage about leaked details of May’s proposal. Those leaks proved to be accurate and the final text promises everything the Brexiteers feared: full regulatory alignment with the EU for goods and agriculture, and a customs arrangement which treats Britain and the EU as “a common customs territory”.EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Friday restated Europe’s rejection of the idea that Britain should be part of the single market for goods rather than services. And he made clear that, if there is to be a “common rulebook” for regulation as May proposes, it will be the EU’s rulebook.Brussels is also sceptical about the latest customs proposal and May’s claim that Westminster will be able to choose which EU regulations to adopt in future will strike a discordant note in Europe.This Chequers statement was never going to be the blueprint for a final deal, however, but it may be bold enough to start a serious negotiation with Brussels. The most crucial passage for Ireland is buried in the middle of the text, almost as an aside.“Taken together, we noted that such a relationship would see the UK and the EU meet their commitments to Northern Ireland and Ireland through the overall future relationship: preserving the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK honouring the letter and the spirit of the Belfast Agreement and ensuring that the operational legal text the UK will nonetheless agree on the ‘backstop’ solution as part of the Withdrawal Agreement would not need to be brought into effect. In this context, we also noted that this proposal should allow both parties to resolve the remaining Withdrawal Agreement issues, including the ‘backstop’,” it says.This suggests that Britain is ready to agree a backstop that would allow for a separate customs and regulatory regime for Northern Ireland if no other solution is found to ensure that the Border remains open – on the basis that it will never be required. Coupled with Barnier’s offer to ensure that any checks on goods coming to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will be purely “technical and operational” this makes an early resolution of the backstop issue more likely.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Alan Betson  Planning permissions viewed as a threat to the State’s security or national interests can now be revoked after the Dáil voted to give the Government sweeping new powers.Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy described it as a “draconian measure” and said the only thing she could think it related to was the planning permission granted in 2015 to the Russian embassy.The embassy was granted permission to more than quadruple the size of its premises, but came under scrutiny in the controversies over electronic surveillance and the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, England with the subsequent expulsion of an embassy diplomat from Ireland in an international retaliatory action.In response, Minister of State Damian English, who is steering the legislation through the Oireachtas, insisted “it is not for any particular reason or to target anything in particular”. He said “there is no one target” but a gap in the law that meant that if something of that nature were identified “there is no way of dealing with it”.He said he expected the powers “will not be abused”.The amendment is one of more than 70 from the Seanad to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill which establishes a new planning regulator, gives statutory backing to the new National Planning Framework and gives effect to the recommendations of the Planning tribunal.Independent TD Catherine Connolly said that in the wake of the tribunal, the key element and “entire function” of the Bill was to improve transparency in the planning process. “But right in the middle of it there is section 44, one of the longest, which does away with transparency. It does away with accountability and gives draconian powers to various Ministers,” said Ms Connolly. Under the provision the Government can, at the behest of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Defence, revoke or modify a granted planning permission where it is viewed as “likely to be harmful to the security or defence of the State or the State’s relations with another state” and in the public interest.Mr English said the power was likely to be invoked only “in very rare and extreme cases” but it should be available to the Government and Ministers to “take proportionate and justifiable action”, where the planning permission “is assessed to be a threat or unacceptable risk to the State”.Sinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin O Broin said he had “grave reservations” about the provision. The safeguards for the affected “person or entity” included referring the matter to the courts “but they will be held in camera so there will be no public scrutiny but crucially documentation relating to the decision of the Minister and Cabinet could be withheld from the parties to that court case”.He said it might be justifiable if it was only permissible where there was a threat or risk to the State, but it could “be used for all sorts of things” because the amendment was far broader than that and could “also relate to foreign policy issues, economic issues or other matters”.Mr English said the provisions were seen as “reasonable and appropriate” and incorporated necessary checks and balances for affected parties.The provision provoked almost an hour of debate in the Dáil before it was accepted by 45 votes to 21. Fianna Fáil voted with Fine Gael to support the provision. Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats and a number of Independents voted against."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3556856.1530917547!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may secures approval from cabinet to negotiate soft brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May hosts a meeting with her cabinet at Chequers to discuss Brexit. Photograph: Joel RouseMOD Crown Copyright Theresa May has persuaded her cabinet to back a soft Brexit, maintaining full regulatory alignment with Europe for goods and agricultural products and treating Britain and the EU as a single customs territory.A statement issued on Friday at the end of a day-long meeting at Chequers suggested that Britain is ready to reach an early agreement on the so-called backstop to guarantee that the Border remains open.Ms May said after the meeting that her cabinet had agreed a collective position for the future of Britain’s negotiations with the EU.“Our proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products. This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our parliament,” she said.“As a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland. We have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world.”Negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal agreement with the EU have been deadlocked on the issue of the Border backstop, with Brussels saying it must apply only to the North and London calling for a UK-wide solution to avoid creating barriers within the UK. The Chequers statement suggests that Britain’s new proposals would help to resolve the issue of the Border so that a backstop could be agreed with Brussels because it will never have to be used.“Such a relationship would see the UK and the EU meet their commitments to Northern Ireland and Ireland through the overall future relationship: preserving the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK honouring the letter and the spirit of the Belfast Agreement and ensuring that the operational legal text the UK will nonetheless agree on the ‘backstop’ solution as part of the withdrawal agreement would not need to be brought into effect.“In this context, we also noted that this proposal should allow both parties to resolve the remaining withdrawal agreement issues, including the ‘backstop’,” the statement says.The Government on Friday night welcomed the move by Ms May, and senior sources said the British government statement was “broadly in line” with what Dublin was expecting.In a statement issued late on Friday, the Government said that EU ministers would consider the UK proposals at a meeting in Brussels on July 20th.However, the Government statement emphasised the importance of the backstop.“While our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, a hard Border will be avoided,” it said.The Government called for the negotiations to be intensified. “Time is short,” it said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Sean GallupGettyBritish prime minister Theresa May has urged her cabinet to take “another step forward” towards a Brexit deal when they meet in Chequers on Friday, as hardline backbenchers warned against remaining too closely aligned with the European Union. \u0026nbspJacob Rees-Mogg said a leaked proposal for regulatory alignment to be discussed at Chequers would turn Britain into a vassal state, as Downing Street denied that the plan would make a trade deal with the United States impossible.The Spectator reported on Thursday that a document circulated to ministers proposes that\u0026nbsp“the UK should maintain a common rulebook for all goods including agri-food” and would make “an upfront choice to commit by treaty to ongoing harmonisation with EU rules on goods”. The document says the deal “would not allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal” as the UK would be unable to recognise the US’s “array of standards”.The prime minister’s official spokeswoman rejected as “categorically untrue” the suggestion Britain would be unable to negotiate a trade deal with the US, whose president, Donald Trump, visits the country next week.“The PM has always been clear that we will seek a comprehensive and ambitious trade deal with the US that reflects the strength of our trading and investment relationship, and as you know the president has also made it clear that he is keen to sit down and talk with the UK about that. And the PM and the president will obviously have a chance to discuss trade next week,” the spokeswoman said. “What I can be very clear on is that it is categorically untrue to suggest that we will not be able to strike a trade deal with the US.”Brexit secretary David Davis declined on Thursday to deny reports that he had written to Ms May warning that her new customs proposal would be unacceptable to Brussels. The “facilitated customs arrangement” would see Britain leave the EU’s common external tariff but all goods entering the UK would be tracked and charged the EU tariff if they were destined for Europe. Speaking ahead of the Chequers meeting, the prime minister said the cabinet had a great opportunity and a duty to set an ambitious course for the country after Brexit.\u0026nbsp“We have already made good progress – on the text of the withdrawal agreement, by passing the EU Withdrawal Act and in agreeing an implementation period which gives people and business certainty. Now is the time for another step forward. We want a deal that allows us to deliver the benefits of Brexit – taking control of our borders, laws and money and by signing ambitious new trade deals with countries like the US, Australia and New Zealand, ” she said."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/13/TELEMMGLPICT000157140466_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqckM73LBkofRqfnrUGvsfN8kokmBBfZYd8t7cNZkTT8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"novichok should do think exposed nerve agent","story":"digitalservices@telegraphMilitary personnel with chemical weapons training have been deployed to Salisbury to aid the investigation into the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliadigitalservices@telegraphCounter-terror police say a couple left in a critical condition in Wiltshire were exposed to the same nerve agent as former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia earlier this year.The couple, named locally as mother Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley, were discovered in Amesbury, around eight miles from where the Skripals were poisoned with Novichok in March.The incident comes four months after Mr Skripal, 67, and and his 33-year-old daughter were poisoned in a suspected Russian backed assassination attempt and will lead to fears that the public in Salisbury could still be at risk.Mr Skripal, a former double agent, and his daughter, who had been visiting him from Moscow, spent two months in hospital. They were discharged in May and are at a secure location.Novichok was identified as the compound used in the attack by experts at the science and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down. Novichok is not a single toxin but a family of  so called fourth generation nerve agents developed by the Russians in the 1970s and 1980s. In some forms, it is reported to be between five and eight times more toxic than earlier nerve agents, such as VX. It can be stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients which, when mixed, react to produce the weaponised nerve agent. This makes it easier to transport and handle – an advantage for an assassin.Michelle Carlin, senior lecturer in forensic and analytical chemistry at Northumbria University, said that it can be used in the form of an ultra-fine powder as well as as a liquid or vapour. It kills after being ingested or absorbed through the skin.Is it the same batch that affected the Skripals?Dr Carlin said it would be unusual if the couple had been affected by nerve agent from the same source as that used against the Skripals four months ago.She said the new case was surprising and, while it is difficult to speculate over where the poison came from, it would be unexpected if it were from same source.It is difficult to speculate whether this is from the original source used in the Skripal case however, if it was from the same source, it is unusual that it has taken four months for someone to be affected by it, Dr Carlin said.Novichok in Salisbury: How could this happen four months after Skripal attack?What is the risk to the general public?Professor Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, said the Skripal episode meant officials had a well-established response in place.She said: You do not need to seek advice from a health professional unless you are experiencing symptoms.She also urged not to pick up any unknown or already dangerous objects such as needles and syringes.What should I do if I visited these locations?You should clean clothing and items you had with you while you were there.Clothing that is dry-clean only should be put in two plastic bags (ie. a double layer), tied at the top and stored safely – PHE is reviewing the best way of cleaning these items and will publish information in due course.Items such as phones and handbags should be cleaned with baby wipes. Jewellery, watches and glasses should be washed with warm water and detergent and then rinsed in clean cold water.Should I destroy items of clothing?Public Health England says this is not necessary but if you want to do this put them in two plastic bags, tie them at the top and dispose of  it in an outdoor bin in the normal way.What effect does Novichok have on the body?Novichok, like all nerve agents, disrupts the chemical signals between the nerves and the muscles which control vital organs, said Dr Carlin.This can lead to breathing difficulties, loss of control of bodily functions, increased salivation, convulsions, paralysis.”Outward symptoms may include white eyes, convulsions, drooling and – in the worse cases – coma, respiratory failure and death.Nerve agents can act within minutes but they can also take hours to take effect. Much depends on the exact toxin, the dose and the delivery method. What is the treatment for those exposed to Novichok?Patients exposed to nerve agents are normally given the drug atropine, which reduces muscle spasms and the production of saliva. It needs to be given as soon after exposure as possible – ideally within minutes.It is likely that atropine was used to treat the Skripals, said Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds.Doctors may also use a drug called pralidoxime, an antidote to organophosphate pesticides and chemicals.Treatments for exposure to nerve agentsWhat are the long-term effects of exposure?Little is known about this, although exposure is thought to lead to long-term harm. One of the Russian scientists who helped develop Novichok, Andrei Zheleznyakov, was accidentally exposed and, according to a book about the history of chemical weapons, War of Nerves by Jonathan Tucker, he suffered permanent ill health including hepatitis, epilepsy, severe depression and an inability to concentrate. He died five years after exposure.The Moscow weapons lab that made the deadly Novichok nerve agentIs there a wider risk from Novichok and other chemical and biological weapons in the UK?The greatest risk comes from the fact that the taboo on the use of chemical weapons, which has held for much of the last 100 years, appears to be breaking down.Politician\u0027s must bend every sinew to reestablish this red line, said Hamish De Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of the UK Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment.Protect yourself and your family by

create an air tunnel underwater against the cave roof, allowing the children to walk through it and duck through the narrow sections.His idea comes amid increasingly desperate efforts to free the youth football team through the onerous method of draining water from a 2.5-mile-long twisting and submerged labyrinth of tunnels separating them from the exit.  On Friday night, speculation rose ahead of a press conference with the interior minister that the evacuation of the boys might be imminent.However, the governor, Narongsak Osottanakorn, on Friday night denied the reports from Belgian media that the evacuation was imminent, saying there would be no immediate ing attempt. They cannot e at this time, he said.He added that the plan was to bring the trapped boys out if the rains worsen. If we think the big rain is coming then we will have to get them out, he said.We have plans and options but if the situation changes we have to adapt to it. This depends on the readiness of the kids to be able to e.A successful extraction would be a huge boost to rescuers who were mourning the tragic death of one of the ers. The death of Saman Kunan, 38, a volunteer and former Thai Navy Seal, came as a cruel jolt to the tireless efforts of ers, engineers and caving experts who have been working furiously to extract the children aged 11-16, and their coach, 25, since they were found sheltering in a muddy chamber on Monday.Petty Officer Kunan died on his way out of the cave complex after delivering air tanks to different locations along the treacherous submerged route that leads to the chamber some 2.5 miles from the main exit. “His job was to deliver oxygen.Thai Military wait for more water pumpsHe did not have enough on his way back,” confirmed Passakorn Boonyalak, Chiang Rai’s deputy governor.Kunan, who was a professionally trained er, appeared from his Facebook page to also be an avid runner and cyclist.The tragedy was a frightening reminder of how dangerous it would be to get the boys, who in a weakened state and some unable to swim, to e through winding, dark passages which take even fit, expert ers five hours, using four oxygen tanks, to battle through strong currents.“Inside the cave is tough,” said Thai Seal commander Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yookongkaew.But he added: “I can guarantee that we will not panic, we will not stop our mission, we will not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste.”Divers have questioned the high-risk strategy of extracting the boys through ing out, even though they are currently being trained to use scuba gear.Bin Bunluerit, famous for working with the Ruamkatanyu Foundation, one of Thailand’s largest rescue foundations said on Thursday that it was too dangerous.It’s “not working,” he said of efforts to drain the floodwater from the cave complex.“The water is still not going down. If you want it to go down by a metre, it’s going to take up to a month,” he told Khaosod news.But deteriorating conditions in the boys’ makeshift shelter, where oxygen levels have dropped to 15 per cent, from a usual level of 21 per cent, are raising anxiety levels, particularly with a dire weather forecast for the coming week that could result in them being trapped for months.A key task on Friday is to lay a pipe into their chamber to provide more air. But a search to find openings above the roof of the cave, in the hope of lifting the boys out, has been stepped up.A team of bird nest hunters and cliff climbing experts has been drafted in to sweep through thick foliage on the mountain over the cave to find possible new shafts inside.It is still unclear how the boys and their coach will escapeMeanwhile, an army of local volunteers has descended on the caves to support the rescuers.Panee Pakdee, 62, told The  she had been cooking 3,000 eggs a day for the teams since the start of the boys’ ordeal. “I wake up at 6am to take the first bus and then go into the kitchen as soon as I arrive to fry eggs,” she said.Ms Panee first learned about the children’s plight at her church, and could not sit still after seeing reports on the TV.“I came to give support and to pray to the Lord to open up the way for the kids,” she said.But amid the sadness of the day, FIFA’s president Gianni Infantino offered a glimmer of hope for the boys.“If, as we all hope, they are reunited with their families in the coming days and their health allows them to travel, FIFA would be delighted to invite them to attend the 2018 World Cup final in Moscow as our guests,” he wrote in a letter to the Football Association of Thailand.Please review our commenting policyMike Pompeo arrives in Pyongyang to press for commitment to denuclearisation\u0026#39Selfie babies\u0026#39: Egg clinic to match would-be mothers with donors who look like themOxford Law Society’s only presidential candidate forced out amid \u0026#39sexist\u0026#39 blog post rowColdstream Guards soldier who \u0026#39prowled\u0026#39 streets of Windsor before raping woman is jailed for 19 yearsBritain\u0026#39s Brexit plan: How the UK will seek to negotiate its exit from the EUSecurity minister: English success at World Cup should not mask the fact that Russia is engaged in \u0026#39murder and espionage\u0026#39  Cabinet agrees Brexit deal that keeps Britain tied to EU rules on goods indefinitelyMystery as golden eagle stolen 25 years ago from Britain\u0026#39s only US war cemetery returns on Independence DayNelson Mandela prison letters reveal pain of separation from his familySalisbury residents are swabbed as the search for the source of the nerve agent continuesThree Canadian YouTube travel bloggers killed after falling over a waterfall in British Columbia  Ireland and Belgium are the new frontiers in the fight against illegal migration, the National Crime Agency warnsWorld\u0026#39s smallest living dog, \u0026#39Miracle Milly\u0026#39, cloned 49 times in South Korea laboratoryToday editor says female hosts are \u0026#39better on fashion\u0026#39 while John Humphrys \u0026#39holds power to account\u0026#39Boots pharmacy mix up led to grandfather\u0026#39s death Research reveals high fees for booking flights over the phone – and Ryanair is the worst offenderFinancial adviser could face jail over £2m owed to ex-wifeWimbledon 2018: Rufus the Hawk has double the workload as pigeons hide in new £70m roofWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/06/TELEMMGLPICT000168597973_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqIkUhv7k5mil0w0oeVCztIhVrDwi3LvLa62XQyE1Z5U4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"salisbury residents swabbed search source nerve agent continues","story":"digitalservices@telegraphSearches for the source of the contamination are underway in Salsiburydigitalservices@telegraphPeople in Salisbury who may have come into contact with the couple poisoned by novichok are being swabbed to ensure they are not carrying traces of the deadly nerve agent, it has emerged.The development came as police locals they could not rule out more people being affected in the future.Anyone who met Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley between Friday evening and Saturday afternoon are being offered tests to check if they too are contaminated.Asked about the swabbing of members of the public, a spokesman for Public Health England said: “We are following up with anyone who we think may have been in direct contact with the affected iniduals as part of our contact tracing process.The spokesman added: The risk to the wider public remains low.”Firefighters are helping out with the search and decontamination processBut a public meeting held in the city earlier, Wiltshire Police, Chief Constable, Kier Pritchard, said he could not rule out that others might be affected in the future.He said: It\u0027s deeply concerning. It\u0027s worrying that we have two members of our community who are gravely ill and, of course, we need to respond to that...I hope we are not back in this position in four months\u0027 time.The warning came as emergency workers in chemical protection suits began a forensic examination of the homes of Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley in a desperate hunt for the source of the contamination.Charlie Rowley remains in a critical condition in hospitalIt is thought the couple could have been poisoned when they accidentally handled a syringe or container that had been used in the assassination attempt on former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia in the city in March.Chemical weapons experts believe a container may have been used by would-be assassins to transport the nerve agent for the initial attack and then simply discarded in a public place when they made their getaway.Soldiers in camouflage protection suits and heavy duty began a detailed search of John Baker House, the hostel where Ms Sturgess, 44, lived.Dawn Sturgess is fighting for her life in hospitalPreparations to mount a similar search were also underway at Mr Rowley’s home in Amesbury, eight miles north of Salisbury, where the couple collapsed and went into convulsions within hours of each other on Saturday.Fire engines and ambulances were driven into position to provide back up and boxes thought to contain protective clothing were seen being carried into the sealed-off house.Police have cordoned off five areas in SalisburyNeighbours of Mr Rowley, in Muggleton Road, spoke of their continued fear at living in such close proximity to a house that may have been contaminated by a deadly chemical nerve agent.Danny Burr, 42, said: “It was a bit of a shock when it all happened and the neighbourhood was completely taken over by police, fire engines, ambulance, and stuff like that.“We don’t really know what\u0027s going on, no-one has told us anything, police haven’t even spoken to us. It’s a long drawn-out process, you just don’t know what’s happening, you don’t know if you\u0027re going to get kicked out of your house, it’s quite strange, quite bizarre.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The whole or part of the backstop can be replaced by the agreement on the future relationship,” he said.“We must all de-dramatise this backstop. We will obviously need to clarify how and where these controls will be done but ultimately these are only technical controls on goods – no more, no less.”The timing of the speech appears to make it a direct appeal to the PM’s cabinet, who are likely to be following the negotiator’s words closely while they try and hash out a coherent policy at Ms May’s country retreat.The EU has effectively suggested Northern Ireland stay in the customs union and continue to follow single market regulations. This would prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland but would introduce customs and regulatory checks for goods on ferries between Northern Ireland and Great Britain – though no passport checks for people.We must all de-dramatise this backstop.This “backstop” would apply “unless and until” another solution was found to prevent a hard border: either a specific solution for Northern Ireland or an overarching trade deal between the UK and the EU that removed the need for checks.The UK has rejected the EU plan and says it wants to remove the need for a hard border with a trade deal or backstop that applies to the whole UK. Part of the opposition comes from the DUP, a Northern Irish unionist party on which Theresa May currently relies for a majority in the House of Commons.The EU has said there can be no Brexit deal without solving the Irish border question, and a no deal is expected to be an economic disaster for the UK.Speaking at the Institute of International and European Affairs think tank in Brussels Mr Barnier reeled off the benefits of single market membership, such as EU standards being emulated around the world, more leverage for trade deals, and seamless trade within the bloc.“In the Brexit negotiations there are still too many questions and too few answers,” he said, later adding: “We still have a long way to go and we do not have much time. The European Council in October is approaching rapidly. On the issue of Ireland and Northern Ireland we obviously need more clarity and most importantly certainty in the long run.”Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The UK would have to be in some form of customs union and single market to prevent border checks – which outside those institutions comprise both checks to make sure products are following regulations, and checks to make sure appropriate customs regulations have been followed.Soon after today’s Cabinet meeting the UK government is expected to publish its white paper laying out its policies – just three months before the deadline to end the negotiations in October.The UK reportedly wants to stay in the single market for goods only, but EU officials and member states worry that this give the UK an unfair advantage over member states and are expected to reject such a proposal if made.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our parliament.“As a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.”The Independent understands that the commitment to maintain a “common rule book” means the UK would effectively seek to stay in a single market for goods, for the foreseeable future at least.Michel Barnier urges Theresa May to reconsider Irish border planUK government has ‘no clue’ how to carry out Brexit, Airbus boss saysRail chaos and GP shortages will bring down the PM, not Brexit Cabinet ministers told to quit if they oppose May’s Brexit planGovernment ‘running out of time’ to guarantee post-Brexit protectionsBrexit documentary suggests everything would be fine if Boris were PMIt is essential to any effort to convince Europe that we should be able to trade with EU countries with ‘frictionless’ borders.Giving parliament the power to erge from these common rules in the future was crucial to securing the support of Brexiteers for the plan, but any move to do so would be taken in the knowledge that it would cost the UK access to the single market.However, the hope is that the UK could retain the freedom to erge on regulations for services, something which the EU already said would make any proposal untenable.Earlier in the day, the deal was discussed over a buffet lunch of BBQ chicken thighs, a “wheat-beets-squash” salad and feta, a Chequers estate new potato salad, estate-grown mixed leaves with summer tomato salad and pomegranate dressings.For desert it was Chequers scones with clotted cream and estate strawberry jam, Graham’s sticky tea loaf and a fruit platter.Ms May went on: “We have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world.“Next week we will be publishing a white paper which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.”Insiders confirmed that the customs model agreed is the FCA mooted by Number 10 on Wednesday, which would see all imported goods charged the UK tariff at the border, keeping Brexiteers happy.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

They said it had been widely discussed among EU ministers and rejected – including, crucially, by the EU’s two most powerful players, France and Germany.One Brussels source said: “We have been telling the UK for two years that we would not accept a single market a la carte.“What do they come with? – A single market a la carte.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He added: “We are still encouraging our customers to voluntarily use water efficiently, by avoiding the use of water hungry devices, particularly outside in the garden.However, if demand does not reduce in the next few days we’ll have no choice but to introduce enforced restrictions.Any usage ban is likely to be staggered, hitting households first before commercial outlets.Other water companies are expected to announce similar plans imminently.It comes after one of the hottest and driest Junes on record — with the current heatwave which started last Monday now the longest since 1976.Average rainfall for the UK last month was just 35.4mm, less than half the normal amount, according to the Met Office.The South East and central southern areas were the worst hit with just 3mm of rain falling throughout June - six per cent of its 50mm average.Parts of the country have dried up, including sections of the River Tyne (before and now, above).The Met Office said it will continue this weekend, with highs of 91F (33C).But Andy White, from industry body Consumer Council for Water, said: “We expect United Utilities to exhaust every opportunity to avoid restrictions.”Britains record-breaking 33C heatwave hasnt just left Brits sweltering, with the roads also feeling the heat as a bin lorry sank into melted tarmac .Stunned locals in Newbury, Berks, found the stuck truck blocking a street after its wheels became lodged in the liquid tarmac in 30C heat yesterday.Weather forecaster Emma Salter said: Theres no let up in sight in terms of the dry weather and high temperatures through the week.She added: Its pretty much dry across the board and no sign of rain.Temperatures will reach a still blazing 32C today with sunshine for most sending Brits flocking to beer gardens across the country.Pub industry insiders predict an extra 8million pints will be sold on Saturday — netting landlords £24million more in revenue than a typical day.Storms had been predicted for Friday earlier in the week but Ms Salter said these were now looking very unlikely and had been removed from the forecast.Scotland might see some rain in the coming days, she said, but the rest of the country could expect it to stay dry until the middle of July.She added: From Monday or Tuesday the really high temperatures will start to gradually come down, but it will still be in the high 20s so it will be less hot rather than cooler.On Thursday there were flash floods in Kent following a sudden downpour after a long stretch of scorching weather and uninterrupted sunshine left the ground unable to absorb the deluge.The thunderstorm in Tunbridge Wells led to train and bus delays.Video posted online showed fast-moving water gushing through streets in the town after around 20 minutes of rainfall between 4pm and 5pm on Thursday, the Met Office said.And in Herefordshire dramatic photos showed the River Teme all but disappeared after evaporating in the parched conditions.Environment Agency workers desperately rushed to rescue more than 500 salmon and trout trapped in isolated pockets of water before they vanished in the heat.There are fears that continuous dry weather expected over the coming days — expected to beat the record hot spell of 1976 — could cause similar problems with the Upper River Wye also currently at a low level.The government has asked for the public to conserve more water and take no longer than four minutes in the shower.A hosepipe ban has also been enforced in Northern Ireland amid record temperatures, with Belfast recording 29.5C this week.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A total, humiliating capitulation.”But Europhile business groups hailed the PMs plans as a genuine confidence boost.The pro-Brussels Confederation of British Industry said it was proof the Government was listening to warnings from big firms.Vote Leave chief and Environment Secretary Michael Gove played a key role in winning the peace for the PM by siding with her in order to isolate the hardline Brexiteers.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it.Mrs May will now publish a White Paper and address MPs on Monday - setting up a long summer of negotiations with Brussels on the offer.The PM said she was hopeful of the details being well received by EU leaders, adding: “Now we want to get on at pace, negotiate this with the EU and bring prosperity and security to people.”Despite bitter divisions within her top team, Mrs May was able to convince a majority of her 29 ministers around to the climbdown plan during four hours of debate in the her sweltering 16th county mansion in Buckinghamshire.Sources claimed that Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Home Secretary Sajid Javid were instrumental in backing the PM’s plan to tip the balance in favour of the PM and leaving the Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and David Davis isolated.Another source said the talks went on for “four hours” with lunch and dinner served in the grand house, insisting: “There was plenty of good humour and it was low on tension”.But another insider added there were “obviously fraught moments”.As news of the deal filtered across Whitehall insiders expressed their shock at “the scale of the climbdown”, expressing surprise that no Brexit minister had quit over the deal.SALADSWheat, beetroot, squash

details of the terms of the deal hours before critical ministers at the summit were given back their mobile phones.And MPs cautioned that the fact Brussels Brexit boss Michel Barnier was “welcoming this White Paper as just a start” meant they were already publicly expecting the UK to slide further towards the EU.Earlier in the day Mr Barnier had opened the EU’s door to compromises by repeatedly refusing to criticise the PM.He said: “I have real respect for Theresa May and I know that her duty, her daily work is not so easy.”But a document setting out Britain’s plan for a future relationship with Brussels set out plans for a “mobility framework” that would allow UK and EU citizens “to travel to each other’s territories and apply for study and work”.The document added this would be “similar to what the UK may offer other close trading partners in the future.”Home Secrertary Sajid Javid is only expected to set out Britain’s post Brexit immigration plans AFTER a provision deal with the EU is agreed this October.During a conciliatory speech at the Irish embassy in Brussels, the Frenchman also called on both sides to “de-dramatise” the Northern Irish border issue.And he hinted that the EU is waiting to kickstart the negotiations on renewed terms if Mrs May softens her red lines.But one MP said: “I need to see the detail but I’m extremely wary.“It sounds to me like we’re going to be rule taker rather than the a rule maker.“It’s feels we are danger of total capitulation to Brussels.”And Brexiteer critics were giving an unlikely boost from arch-remainer Sir Nick Clegg who said they were right to reject Mrs May’s third way custom fudge that would lead to “vast red tape” while “smugglers would boom” and “Parliament left humiliated” as a simple rubber stamper.Tempers had already reached boiling point in the run up to the summit after Downing Street publicly warned one in Government who quit could watch her soft-Brexit march continue from the sidelines.No10 insiders revealed emergency reshuffle plans were already in place incase of Ministerial walkouts from her crunch Brexit summit.The day was broken into three sections with the first seeing Brexit guru Olly Robbins brief ministers on the “Available Outcomes in Light of the EU’s Current Position”.But the testy exchanges were seen in the afternoon’s session titled The UK’s Proposed Approach”.Before the ministers had even sat down around the table Downing Street infuriated them by warning that they would have to get a taxi home as they would be stripped of their limos immediately if they walked out in protest.A senior Government source said: “Taxi cards for Aston’s taxis the local cab firm are in the foyer for those who decide they can’t face making the right decision for the country but it will still be a long walk as it is a mile long driveway.The official raged: “A select number of narcissistic, leadership dominated cabinet ministers need to support the PM in the best interests of the UK or their spots will be taken by a talented new generation of MPs who will sweep them away.”And The Sun revealed that the whips had summoned dozens of junior ministers for a series of meetings to sound them out over the PM’s plans as possible future cabinet replacements in the case of a mass walkout.Housing minister Dominic Raab, Crime minister Victoria Atkins and Local Government minister Kit Malthouse were touted as possible replacements.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Signalling that the UK might stay in a Customs Union was another enormous error.Downing Street has consistently left unchallenged the scare tactics of professional Remainers — big businesses seeking ongoing EU protection, Brussels-funded think tanks and member states wanting UK cash.The Irish land border, for instance, already copes with different currencies, duties and other tax rates.Outside the Customs Union there is no need for physical hard border posts that might inflame sectarian sensitivities — as confirmed by the head of HMRC, his Irish equivalent and a study published by the European Parliament.Instead of explaining these realities, and arguing Britain’s corner, Mrs May has allowed Irish border falsehoods to warp her entire Brexit strategy.Roberto Azevedo insisted trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules was “perfectly manageable”.She has similarly failed to counter claims it would be disastrous to leave the EU with no free trade agreement, using World Trade Organisation rules instead.Again, this is nonsense. Britain already conducts most of its trade outside the EU, largely under WTO rules.“It is not the end of the world if UK-EU trade is on the basis of WTO rules”, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo told me. “It’s ­perfectly manageable.”That’s a vital insight because, unless no deal is seen as a viable option, the UK’s negotiating hand is seriously undermined — with Britain then forced to accept whatever trade deal the EU offers as March 2019 nears.The Government should have been making determined and very visible preparations for no deal.The irony is that, behind the scenes, there has been considerable work.Last week the National Audit Office concluded that an HMRC upgrade that was happening anyway means ­Britain’s customs service should be ready to cope with no deal from January 2019.Instead of pursuing such rational strategies, Mrs May now wants the UK, in effect, to stay in the Single Market for goods, while facing greater restrictions on trade in services.This is totally lopsided — Britain is far better at exporting services (we run a £14billion annual surplus with the EU) than goods (which show a £96billion EU deficit).And proposals to solve the Irish border by tracking goods and collecting the EU’s tariff revenues have already been rejected by Brussels.Mrs May should just leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, with no deal if necessary.By presenting absurd ideas, our Mad Hatter Prime Minister appears to hope her people will conclude Brexit is too hard and should be abandoned.If so, she doesn’t understand the country she purports to govern.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not content with being ignored, OFOC staged a protest outside Theresa May\u0027s Chequers summit today. In an open letter to the PM, the group wrote: We can only infer from your Cabinet’s wholesale refusal to meet and discuss your Brexit deal with us that you and your colleagues know what we fear: your deal will deeply damage our future.

The panicking Prime Minister had feared mass resignations and was even drawing up an emergency reshuffle. But despite weeks of threats to quit, Brexiteer Tories appeared to bottle it at a 12-hour Chequers showdown - which had been dubbed The Body Bag Summit. Mrs May announced a big shift to a \u0027softer\u0027 Brexit after treating ministers to whisky-cured salmon and whisky barrel chips at her country retreat. But within minutes of the announcement tonight, The Times reported that Mrs May told senior allies she would sack Boris Johnson if he seeks to undermine the Brexit negotiating position agreed by her cabinet.  Brexiteers Boris, Michael Gove and David Davis had previously hinted they were ready to walk. They were even warned they\u0027d have to swap their ministerial cars for a local taxi for the 40-mile trip back to London if they quit. But tonight - while they were still at Chequers, without their phones - Mrs May announced her Cabinet had agreed a collective position for future UK negotiations with Brussels.   Speaking after the meeting, the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the Chequers plan would be assessed to see if it is workable and realistic. A round of UK-EU negotiations will take place in the week beginning July 16, he added.  The new plan explained - and why the EU could still reject it The vulnerable PM broke the deadlock by coming up with a peace offering for both the Remain and Leave camps. In a bid to solve the Northern Ireland issue, she now wants to keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. This will include sharing a common rulebook for all goods including agricultural and food products - which critics had feared would make it harder to get a US trade deal. The PM claimed this will help the UK avoid friction in trade - protecting jobs and businesses. But in a desperate bid to prevent Brexiteers resigning, she also said Parliament would keep the right to block future changes to the trading rules. The olive branch to the Brexiteers means Mrs May remains vulnerable - because there is no guarantee the EU will accept her new plan. In a sign of nerves across government, the Cabinet also agreed to step up backup plans for a No Deal Brexit.  More details of the plan The deal also proposes a common rulebook with the EU on state aid rules, which left-wing critics - including Jeremy Corbyn - say prevent the government intervening to help crisis-hit industry. On the other hand, Tory Brexiteers could be angry at how courts will intervene in disputes. UK courts, not the European Court of Justice, would rule on disputes in the UK - but would have to pay due regard to EU case law in areas with a common rulebook.  What happens next The Prime Minister now plans to publish a more detailed White Paper next week as she mounts a tour of EU capitals - to persuade leaders to accept it. Speaking tonight after a marathon day of talks at the 16th-century manor house, Mrs May said: Today in detailed discussions the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU. Our proposal will create a UK - EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products. This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament. She claimed this would meet our commitments in Northern Ireland. The PM added: Next week we will be publishing a white paper which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders. Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.

One aide to the Prime Minister warned ‘blood on the carpet is no bad thing’ as she faces the threat of a mass resignation. It\u0027s an apt phrase - because Chequers wouldn\u0027t be out of place in a murder mystery. Ministers have been told that their phones will be confiscated on arrival at the luxurious Buckinghamshire retreat to avoid leaks. And between wood-panelled walls and sumptous grounds, talks are expected to last late into the night.  The PM’s country retreat has played host to many important talks in the past, including last year when Mrs May met with senior aides and pollsters to discuss the pros and cons of calling the snap election that resulted in her losing her majority. But what is Chequers and why is it being used for these crucial talks? Here’s everything you need to know…  Chequers is a luxurious country house found just outside of Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire, about 41 miles from 10 Downing Street. One theory is it is named after the chequer trees that grow on the estate. It’s not the biggest of stately homes, with just 10 bedrooms (Buckingham Palace has 240) but it has vast swathes of land - around 1,500 acres are at the owner’s disposal. It also features a huge art collection, with 190 pieces dating from the early sixteenth century to a 1937 piece by none other than Winston Churchill.  It was built in its present form in 1565 by the High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, William Hawtrey, though historians say there has been a manor house on the site since the Roman era. The house has been connected to many important events and personalities in British history. One of its owners was a grandson of the puritanical Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell. Why does Theresa May get to stay there?  Chequers has been at the disposal of the Prime Minister of the day since it was gifted to the nation by its then-owners Lord and Lady Lee in 1917. The Chequers Act of 1917, which was given Royal Assent on 20 December 1917, established the house as the country residence of the Prime Minister. In the past, most PMs were landed aristocrats who already had country retreats, but for those with lesser means like Lloyd George it was necessary to have an estate to host foreign dignitaries and the like.  Interestingly, this was the first Act of Parliament to even acknowledge the existence of a Prime Minister, even though the title had been used unofficially for over a century. Since Lloyd George first stayed there in 1921, Chequers has been used by PMs for crunch summits and meetings like today’s - but also for family Chrsitmases and simply relaxing weekends amid the stresses of office. What famous events have taken place there?

Known as Panama disease, the fungal infection has already spread throughout Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Central America. But if the infection reaches South America the Cavendish banana – the species most commonly sold and consumed worldwide – could face extinction. Cavendish bananas are genetically identical to one another, which allows Panama disease to rapidly decimate entire harvest yields. Some five billion Cavendish bananas are eaten each year in the UK alone.  But salvation for banana crops could come in the form of a rare Madagascan tree, which grows an unpalatable, wild species of banana that is immune to Panama disease. Plant biologists are rushing to create a hybrid of the two species of banana in the hope of creating a infection-resistant strain. But there are only five Madagascan banana trees in existence. The disease does not affect the fruit itself, but rapidly kills Cavendish banana plants.

Joyce Ross had settled down to eat her dinner when she heard someone entering her ground floor flat through the front door.  Her suspicions were immediately aroused, so the brave OAP armed herself with the back scratcher and urged the scruffy stranger to get out, Chronicle Live reports .  But in an ordeal lasting around 20 minutes, the burglar barged past the 73-year-old and refused to leave her flat despite Joyce repeatedly asking him what he wanted and shouted at him to get out. The pensioner stood her ground and eventually sent him packing when she picked up the back scratcher she keeps to deal with annoying itches, and chased him with it.  Detectives are still hunting the man, who snatched Joyce’s handbag before he fled. And the courageous victim has told why she had to stand up to the invader. She said: “I stayed in control and I just wanted to get him out. I don’t think it has sunk in yet, but I do think I was quite brave now. “I stood up to him because he came into my house. He had no right to just walk into my home like that. He pushed his luck and I think I shocked him by standing up to him. The shock and the anger just kicked in.” Joyce, of Byker, Newcastle, was sitting on her sofa watching television when the man crept in at around 6.15pm on Monday.  She had earlier closed the blinds on her front window to stop the glare from the early-evening sun hitting her screen. When Joyce first heard her front door open she assumed it was a member of her family letting themselves in. But she went to investigate after calling out and getting no answer. And as she reached the doorway she was confronted by a tall stranger who was standing in her hall mumbling to himself. “I could tell that he was really out of it,” said Joyce. “He never spoke, he just mumbled to himself. “I said: ‘Get out, get out. Just tell us what you want but get out’. My defence was just shouting and I was waving my arms, but he seemed oblivious to it. He didn’t say a thing, then he moved forward.”  The man then pushed Joyce against the door frame as he walked into her lounge. “He was just standing there mumbling,” she continued. “He wasn’t saying anything or doing anything so I just didn’t know what he wanted. If he had asked for a packet of tabs I would have given them to him just to get him out.” Joyce picked up the blunt table knife that had been on the tray next to her tea, but the intruder knocked it out her hand. She reached for her phone and tried to dial 999, but again he took the handset off her.  Determined Joyce then spotted the back scratcher her granddaughter had bought home as a present from a holiday in Benidorm, which she always keeps near her sofa. “It wasn’t really to use as a weapon, it was just a threat,” she said. The man quickly grabbed something from the coffee table and ran out the front door and fled down the street. It wasn’t until Joyce returned to the living room that she realised her bag, containing two purses and a mobile phone, had gone. Joyce then called the police.  She was treated at her home by paramedics for a small cut to her head sustained in the struggle. And detectives are now appealing for help from the public to identify the man, while praising Joyce for her bravery. Det Sgt Tony Scott, of Northumbria Police, said: “The man responsible is most likely an opportunist thief so people would have seen him on Denmark Street before this incident. “He has entered the house through an unlocked door and been able to make off with Ms Ross’ purse but I am sure he wasn’t anticipating the reception he received. “Ms Ross showed great courage to stand up to the man and force him from her home. We are making sure she is safe and supported but I want to praise her for her actions.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bride refuses screen world cup","story":"NewsBride REFUSES to screen World Cup quarter-final match - so guests say they\u0027re not comingThe woman has also banned guests from checking their phones and says her big day is a \u0027football-free zone\u0027\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByElaine McCahill12:40, 6 JUL 2018Updated13:15, 6 JUL 2018NewsThe woman has also banned wedding guests from checking their phones (Image: EyeEm)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA bride-to-be has refused to screen England\u0027s World Cup quarter-final match against Sweden at her wedding - and some of her guests are not happy. The woman has also banned guests from checking their phones during the game and will have a sign at the venue to remind them that it\u0027s a football free zone. In response, some of the guests have threatened not to attend due to her attitude.  The woman reportedly posted on Facebook that she had had received multiple requests from guests wanting to know if the football will be shown.  It prompted Mumsnet user \u0027arghhhhhhh\u0027, who claims to know the woman, to post a comment on the website\u0027s \u0027Am I being Unreasonable\u0027 thread.  It said: Just been on fb and someone I know (though not well and I am nit invited to the wedding!) is getting married on Saturday. Obviously England are playing. She has it a status on saying she has had multiple requests from guests wanting to know if the football will be shown. Her status basically says she\u0027s angry at the messages she\u0027s had and under no circumstances will the football be shown. It\u0027s her wedding and the day is about that and that only. She\u0027s asked that no one checks their phones during the match and is even going to have a sign made for when people enter the venue as a reminder it\u0027s a football free zone. Now she\u0027s had a fair few comments - a couple even say they wouldn\u0027t attend if they were invited due to her attitude What\u0027s everyone\u0027s opinions?  The Mumsnet user said that she\u0027d happily screen the game. The atmosphere would be amazing. I\u0027d be jumping around with everyone else in my dress, she said. Also a great way to break up the day. The day goes so fast for the bride and groom but the day guests....it can be such a long and tiring day. What a great way to break up the day! Also, we are doing well, we haven\u0027t been in this situation where we may actually have a good chance of WINNING!!!! for years and probably never will again. The whole country is routing for them. Even people who don\u0027t like football are into it. I just don\u0027t think it\u0027s fair to expect people not to watch it, or not even check their phones! But she added that she understood the bride-to-be\u0027s frustrations and, as she\u0027d got married herself recently, she knew the stress of planning.  Other Mumsnet users agreed the match should be shown. FootballsComingHome said: I would show it, everyone\u0027s going to be checking phones otherwise, my dad was at a wedding in 66 and they showed the match at the reception until it went to extra time, then the bride put a stop to it so they all went to the pub instead. ReservoirDogs added: What kind of numpty gets married when the World Cup is on without checking when fixtures are (the fixtures have been out for ages even if you don\u0027t know which slot England would fit in to)? Even if you are not a fan yourself you know that the majority of people are and will want to see it. But others sympathised with the bride-to-be.

Kayla Hanna, 20, told the guards she needed the fizzy drink to maintain her blood sugar levels for her diabetes.  She even showed the employees her tattoos on her wrist that indicated her condition and her insulin pack, Belfast Live today reports.   But the overzealous workers took the Lucozade off Kayla at the Red Hot Chilli Peppers gig in Balmoral, Belfast.   Then aged 18, it left the music student very anxious and upset during the show as she feared she\u0027d become seriously ill.  But now Kayla, of Belfast, has been awarded \u0026pound2,000 after a judge ruled Eventsec, which employed the staff, was in breach of the Disability Discrimination Act.  Kayla had the support of The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, which felt Eventsec should have been able to make simple adjustments to meet the woman\u0027s medical needs. Kayla, who has Type 1 diabetes, said: I carry Lucozade with me at all times as it gives me the glucose I need if my blood sugar levels go down.  When the security guard told me I couldn’t bring the bottle in I told her of my condition and showed her the tattoos on my wrist which indicate I have diabetes. She said that, \u0027anyone could have that\u0027 so I also showed her my insulin pack and the meter used to check my levels. She consulted with another guard and they insisted that they had a strict policy and they would not allow me to bring the drink inside. She added: I was very anxious and upset throughout the concert. I stood away from the area near the stage where my friends were because I was afraid something would happen to me and I would not have the Lucozade.  This had never happened me at other concerts I went to. I really hope that, now this issue has been brought to light, it won\u0027t happen again to me or other people who live with diabetes. Mary Kitson, senior legal officer of Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, said: These are the kind of circumstances in which the reasonable adjustment provisions in the Disability Discrimination Act can be most beneficial. They are in the Act to ensure that people with disabilities are not denied access to services by reason of general policies which can, in themselves, be otherwise justifiable and necessary. In this case, the company should have made arrangements to ensure that Kayla could have accessed Lucozade during the concert if needed, for example by directing her to its own medical centre at the venue and providing her with a bottle of Lucozade. That would have been a simple adjustment and would have met her medical needs. The court has ruled that this was a breach of the law and awarded Kayla \u0026pound2,000.” But Eventsec says it is disappointed with the court\u0027s decision.

A new report says they are the “lifeblood” of the economy and every \u0026pound1 invested in bus services would generate \u0026pound3.32 of economic benefits. It revealed that bus passengers make 1.4 billion shopping trips and spend around \u0026pound27billion on retail goods every year. Buses are the main mode of travel to city centres and are used even more than cars. People who travel in by bus account for 29% of spending in cities.  Every day, almost 2.5 million people all over Britain travel to work by bus, and a million more use the bus as a vital back up. Yet since the Tories came to power in 2010 bus services have been savaged. Steve Chambers, of the Campaign for Better Transport and Greener Journeys, said: ”Our latest report confirms that the slow death of the supported bus continues, with local authority bus budgets suffering yet another cut this year. “The resulting cuts to services mean many people no longer have access to public transport, with rural areas hit especially hard.” He said evening and weekend services were often first to go leaving people cut off from work, education, shops and evening entertainment. The Campaign for Better Transport recommends targeted investment in buses to play a key role in the Mirror’s High Street Fightback campaign. But the Tories have cut funding for buses by \u0026pound182million, nearly half. At the same time fares have gone up by 13% above inflation and 3,347 routes have been axed or reduced.

The ship is the largest civilian shipbuilding project in the UK for 30 years. The last time a vessel of similar scale was launched into the River Mersey from the Cammell Laird slipway was in 1981 when the yard built the RFA Bayleaf for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. A workforce of 900 have been working on the RRS Sir David Attenborough for the past two years.

Rescuers were met with conditions so vile they were forced to wear respiratory equipment when entering the room in Cardiff, Wales. The animals were living amid piled-up filth in the bedroom, which was full of cobwebs, straw, debris and rusty furniture. It took RSPCA staff a day to clear the room. A small number of the guinea pigs died, with the others remaining in the charity\u0027s care.  Barbara Herbert, from Cardiff, has now admitted causing 29 guinea pigs to unnecessarily suffer at Cardiff Magistrates’ Court. A warrant had been out for her arrest since February in relation to the case. She admitted the Animal Welfare Act offence when she appeared at the court on Monday. Herbert was handed a two-year conditional discharge, deprived of the 29 animals and banned from keeping all animals for a decade. She was also fined \u0026pound300 in costs, and told to pay a \u0026pound20 victim surcharge.  The RSPCA said the incompetent care of the guinea pigs caused unnecessary suffering, with conditions at the property “squalid and entirely inappropriate” for the care of the animals. It is hoped the guinea pigs now in the charity\u0027s care will soon be available for rehoming.

But as nice as it is to have stolen the Australian summer, us Brits just aren\u0027t used to coping with sudden rises in temperature. Still, all it really takes is a bit of preparation. Here are our tips for keeping comfortable and safe in this glorious weather. Now get out there and enjoy! Hydrate early, hydrate often    Your body is two-thirds water and you need to keep it topped up. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll get headaches and may also be more tired than usual. Hydration is, as most things are, even more important for little ones. According to the British Nutrition Foundation children are less heat tolerant than adults and have a higher percentage of water in their bodies. They\u0027re also tricky little monkeys who rarely remember to drink unless reminded. The key then, is going to be making it fun to grab a drink. If you have an outdoor power socket in your garden then connect up the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) and fill it with drinks. That way your kids can get their own chilled drink - they\u0027ll love this. You can just as easily put the coolbox inside if you don\u0027t have an outdoor power outlet. Alternatively, if you If you are planning to be out and about, you can also charge the cooler from your car\u0027s 12v power outlet. Make staying hydrated even more fun for the kids with a set of plastic Rainbow Tumblers, \u0026pound3 (half price).  Be skin-savvy Being outside in the sunshine is enjoyable, but its UV rays can do lasting damage to your skin. Applying a high SPF sun cream is vital - but it\u0027s also best to avoid exposing your skin to direct sun for prolonged periods, especially between midday and 3pm, when the sun is strongest. This is especially important for kids. So with a cloudless, beautiful summer sky you\u0027re going to need to create some shade. If you\u0027re at the beach, then a dedicated shelter will help. Halfords\u0027 Beach Shelter offers a 30+ UV protection. If you\u0027re spending most of the day out in the garden and the kids are in and out of the paddling pool, you may need more protection. The Halfords 300 Gazebo costs just \u0026pound69 ( was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21) and has a UV 50+ rating.  When choosing a gazebo or shelter for the sunny weather it\u0027s worth understanding those UV protection numbers. With a 50+ rating the gazebo should stop around 97 to 98 per cent of the UV radiation from the sun. This, combined with sun cream will help keep you all much safer. With any gazebo you might also want to consider some weights to go along with it. Just because it\u0027s sunny, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t also be a bit blowy out! Baby, it\u0027s hot outside The hot weather can feel uncomfortable for adults, but it\u0027s particularly important to keep babies in the shade - as they are less able to sweat to cool down and their skin is very sensitive. So it\u0027s worth investing in a stroller or pram with a decent sun visor if you are taking your little one out and about in the sun.  The Joie Mirus Scenic Stroller, \u0026pound120, is an affordable modern stroller which comes with a SPF 50+ sun canopy. (It can also be paired with either the Joie Gemm or Joie Juva Infant Car Seat, to create a travel system, with no adapter needed.)  For playing in the garden or trips to the beach, grab the Halfords Infant Playshade, \u0026pound25. It pops up and down in less than 10 seconds and is made from specially tested material that provides a 50+ UV protection factor. Stay cool in the car  It\u0027s fair to say we love most things about summer, but getting into a hot car on a sweltering day isn\u0027t one of them. Did you know your air conditioning loses charge every year, making it less efficient and making your car warmer? Halfords now offers a FREE Air Con Check, to check your refrigerant levels and see if they need to be topped up for optimal performance. If they do need topping up, you can purchase air con essentials from store to recharge at home or, you can book in for an air con recharge service and Halfords can take care of it for you. You can also keep out the worst of the heat by investing in a windscreen shield to reflect the sun\u0027s glare. The Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield is just \u0026pound7.99 - and when winter eventually does roll around, you can also use it to protect against the build up of snow and frost.

Margaret \u0027Mags\u0027 Murphy from Dublin, Ireland had grown concerned about lesions on her forehead - which doctors initially claimed was psoriasis. But further inspection showed that this was skin cancer, and that she would need treatment. The mum explained that she had lesions on her forehead that had been there for years but wouldn\u0027t go away.  She told Dublin Live : Seven years before I was diagnosed, one dermatologist told me it was psoriasis. But then the lesions started to blister, I could feel them tingle all the time.  Mags then went to her doctor in Dublin, who referred her to St James\u0027 Hospital but was told she wouldn\u0027t hear back from them for 18 months to two years.  The Dubliner wasn\u0027t in a rush about getting her lesions checked because they were hidden by her hair, so she waited the two years before going back to her doctor in 2016. Mags continued: She sent in an urgent referral and I heard back in a couple of weeks. After she finally got an appointment made with the hospital, Mags was diagnosed with pre-cancerous cells. The 47-year-old was then given a treatment called efudex, which is a type of chemotherapy you can do from home. She wasn\u0027t scared by what happened after living 13 years in Greece, adding that she wasn\u0027t surprised. Mags said: I liked the sun and my mother had been through the same treatment.  I knew it could be treated. I was able to have the cancerous cells frozen off but because of my history, they said there could be more that haven\u0027t shown up yet so they treated my whole face. Mags explained that even though the lesions on her face looked the worst, it was actually her chin that was worst affected despite having no visible signs.

So, as I am lofted from the deep I spread my arms out like Christ the Redeemer, hang in the air momentarily before teetering alarmingly forward and belly-flopping with an enormous smack. This is a first attempt at synchronised swimming for men, and it’s hardcore. Male synchro has been given the big screen treatment in a new British comedy staring Adeel Akhtar, Thomas Turgoose, Jim Carter, Rob Brydon, Daniel Mays and Rupert Graves.  Much in the spirit of The Full Monty, it follows the antics of a group of middle-aged men who escape their humdrum lives by forming a synchro troupe. There are plenty of laughs, but the movie busts the myth that synchro is a sport for girls in sparkly swimsuits with fixed grins. To find out just how demanding it is, I join Stephen Adshead, Ronan Daly and Chris Jepson, three of our top male synchro competitors, for a splash course. My guides, who all appear in the movie and helped train the actors, are members of the UK’s only male synchro team, run by the Out To Swim club. They take me through the basics before we plunge into Tooting Bec Lido in South London.  Once in the water, Chris explains that every synchro newbie needs to master the art of staying afloat gracefully. This is harder than it looks. The hand movements required are called sculls and the leg movement is called an eggbeater. In competitive synchro, touching the bottom is banned, so a strong scull and eggbeater combo is vital. The hand movements take some practice, but the eggbeater is ridiculously hard and works by rotating one leg clockwise and the other anti-clockwise. Chris explains that a strong eggbeater allows a swimmer to rise out of the water. To illustrate, he kicks his legs and rises majestically from the blue like Poseidon without his trident. I try, but splutter and bob around in a circle like a disorientated guppy.  I’m in good company, though. Rob Brydon confessed that he too struggled with the eggbeater. He said: “I never mastered it. It’s fiendishly difficult.” Competitive synchro involves all the technical ability of gymnastics and ballet, while holding your breath under water, often upside down. As Ronan explains: “Generally people think it is not difficult or strenuous and is just about making pretty patterns. But the reality is, synchro is technically and physically demanding. You have to think and co-ordinate so many things at once.” The Swimming With Men cast joined my guides on a two-week boot camp before filming. They spent four hours a day in the pool, a process so demanding, each cast member lost around 7lb.  Later Brydon, 53, who plays lead role Eric, said: “If you’d told me from the outset what we would do, I would have said no. Being held underwater with someone’s feet around your neck and then your feet around someone else was pretty scary.” Back in the lido, I master a half-decent scull, which lets me try a few shapes. First, I try a back layout, then slowly pull my knees in to create a foetal position-like “tub”. Remarkably, in a few minutes we have a basic routine. We form a cross, pull into a tub, spin round individually, then extend our legs to come back into a cross. Judging by the faces of onlookers, it looks impressive from the sidelines. I fling myself into the next move the ballet leg. From a back layout, I must bend one knee and then raise that leg straight in the air. Each time I try, I sink. In the end, I am helped to stay afloat but the effort of straightening a leg in water makes my hamstring scream in protest. Ronan then suggests we try an inverted tub so I can experience the feeling of being upside down.  Chris demonstrates and hangs underwater in an upturned kneeling position. When I try, my body refuses to invert, so my guides help and flip me over. I hang upside down, disorientated, wondering which way is up and which is down. I then try another classic move, the clam. This involves pivoting at the waist and sinking gracefully under the water. I flap around on the surface, and am later told buoyancy can be a blessing or a curse, depending on whether you need to be above or below the waterline. In the movie, Jim Carter, 69, was so buoyant he had to have weights inserted in his shorts for underwater scenes.  The Out To Swim team was established in 2009 and the club was the first to offer synchro sessions aimed at men. The idea came about after some members watched the Spanish men’s synchro team rehearse for a tournament. Stephen explains: “They did a routine to Stairway to Heaven and there were no fake smiles or flashy costumes. It was different, and it was masculine. A few of us watched it and said, ‘We can do that’. So we came back and started the club.” They are hoping the movie will encourage more people to try the sport and that it will one day be an Olympic event for men as well as women.

Even though they\u0027re still months away from meeting their baby, the changes to their day-to-day life start immediately. There\u0027s a whole host of foods they can no longer eat, they can\u0027t drink and they will sometimes have to give up the hobbies they love. But there\u0027s one thing Pippa Middleton, who is expecting her first child with husband James Matthews, is refusing to give up despite that growing baby bump.   Writing in her column for Waitrose Weekend , the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s little sister, 34, explains why she is still playing tennis.  She said: I\u0027ve been a tennis fan since childhood, as player and spectator, and have been keen to continue playing safely throughout pregnancy. Take Serena Williams – she famously proved that women can play a high level of tennis from two months (when she won the 2017 Australian Open) up to eight months. Few of us can relate to this elite excellence, but if you\u0027re a healthy, well-trained player with an uncomplicated pregnancy there\u0027s no reason why you can\u0027t continue a good level of tennis.  It is believed Pippa is due in October. And it\u0027s not just playing which Pippa enjoys, and she\u0027s a regular at Wimbledon. She was in the crowds for day four of this year\u0027s competition with her brother James.

Headteacher Richard Potter scrapped breaktime matches after spotting children diving, arguing with each other, and taking the game \u0027too seriously\u0027. The youngsters had been copying the theatrical antics of players including Brazil star Neymar. Mr Potter, who insists he is not anti-football, says the ban will be lifted once children have written a new code of conduct.  He said: “These are four to 11-year-olds who are trying to emulate the older players - this was causing a lot of arguments. “I am not anti-football at all. This is a learning opportunity to build on their sportsmanship.” One parent at the school said: The World Cup should be an event that encourages more young people to get playing football, not less. “The fact our headteacher has chosen to ban kids from playing football, I feel, is quite shocking.  “There must be another method he can use to discourage children from aggressive behaviour. Parents at Home Farm School, Colchester, Essex, were informed about the change in an e-mail sent out on Wednesday. Headteacher Potter says he he wants to encourage students playing fairly with morals and sportsmanship. During the week ban children will write their own football rules with the help of teachers. Child psychologist Emma Kenny has criticised the move.  She said: Banning kids from football is like tying their arms up. Children are resilient and enjoy having competition as well as - they are just mimicking the professionals. It is part of the world and it is in our DNA. It is a great thing. They need that rough and tumble - it is something that is healthy.

Today is expected to top the previous hottest day record of 32C - and temperatures are going to stay high this weekend as England take on Sweden in the World Cup. Tourists and workers in London suffered through boiling conditions as they travelled home tonight as they faced temperatures of up to 35C on packed tube carriages. A signal failure at White City in west London brought chaos to the central line - with one station announcer saying he wasn\u0027t sure if the train would be waiting at the station for five minutes, five hours, or five years.  The central line consistently breaks records with temperatures peaking at 35.5C last summer - this exceeds the EU limit of 30C at which it is legal to transport cows, sheep and pigs. Trains from Paddington were also delayed due to an electricity failure and trains from Liverpool Street disrupted thanks to a points failure - causing thousands of people to wait in stations in the unberable hear. As the heatwave has raged on for nearly two weeks passengers travelling through Essex said people have fainted on trains as they travel home in 28C to 30C heat.  Some have hit out at rail firms by comparing the conditions on packed trains to a sauna with no air conditioning and barely any room to move. As the temperatures remain above average for the 12th day in the row Wimbledon fans were seen struggling as they watched on day five of the championships. Fans were seen fanning themselves and trying to cover their skin to avoid getting burnt as they tried to focus on the game. And this morning \u0027official pigeon scarer\u0027 Rufus the Hawk had to begin his daily shift at 5am on Centre Court to avoid the heat. Yesterday a West Berkshire Council bin lorry got stuck in Newbury yesterday after the road melted beneath it.  Thames Valley Police said the street had to be closed overnight to enable the damage to be assessed causing travel chaos through the town centre. Drivers have also been warned about driving in extreme temperatures over fears driving in the intense heat is almost like driving with a blood-alcohol reading. SEAT have published new information on driving in extreme temperatures, warning that people who make mistakes with their air conditioning during the intense heatwave risk lowering their driving ability.    A koi carp called \u0027Big White Fish\u0027 has even been rushed to hospital this week after getting burnt in the ongoing hot weather. Owner Pat Smythe, 70, from Burton-on-Trent noticed a big patch of red scales on his back and rushed him to the vet. Pet owners have been urged to take measures to stop their animals getting sunburn - with dogs , rabbits, cats, cows and even goldfish at risk - as the country is in the midst of its longest heatwave since 1976. Derby vet Paul Revell said: Believe it or not, fish can get sunburnt if they spend too long at the surface of a pond or lake.  There could be some relief from the heat for a brief period this weekend as some scattered showers will develop over Britain but most areas will remain dry and warm. An amber level heatwave alert has been issued for western parts of England with temperatures soaring over the next few days. London and the South East will bear the brunt of the sweltering conditions and high pressure will dominate the weather with prolonged periods of sunshine and more scorching air from the continent blocking any periods of cooler, unsettled Atlantic conditions. This has created an area of clear air above the UK, where cloud is suppressed and winds have been low to allow maximum heat to come through from the sun.  Hot conditions are expected to continue into next week. It may be sporadically cloudy and slightly fresher in the northwest at times with a little more rain or drizzle . However, for those wanting a respite from the heat, there is some hope on the horizon. More unsettled weather may start to develop later this month with occasional spells of more changeable conditions edging across the UK, particularly in the north and northwest.

A study of 2,000 adults identified this as the stage in their lives when they feel they can no longer don the clothes they used to - and instead have to ‘dress their age’. At this point, two thirds become less experimental with what they wear and simply stick to ‘what they know’. Almost half are too embarrassed to adorn ‘on-trend’ clothing and two in five struggle to know what suits them.   Commissioned by savings site VoucherCodes, the research also found 28 per cent of Brits think they dress younger than their actual age.  Anita Naik, lifestyle editor at VoucherCodes, said: “For many of us, what we wear is very much part of our identity and how we want to be perceived by others. “You’d assume that by the time you reach your late 30’s you’ve got your style down to a tee, but how we want to be perceived can change as we get older.  “The results suggest we become a little more subtle with our style as we get older – making us less likely to commit fashion faux pas.” The research found it’s a myth that those in their 30s and 40s stop trying to keep up with the latest fashion. In fact the average 35 to 44 year old spends \u0026pound321.57 on clothing a year – more than any other age group. But sadly around one fifth of items bought stay in the wardrobe - never to be worn. Overall men and women will spend a total of \u0026pound14,210 and \u0026pound20,740 on clothing respectively during their lifetime.  Men will end-up wasting a total of \u0026pound2,292 on pieces which end up in the bin or the local charity shop - and similarly, women will spend \u0026pound3,343 on fashion they later regret buying.  Carried out through OnePoll , the research also found the typical woman will adopt five different styles or looks and the average man will adopt four - throughout their adult years.  It also emerged four in 10 Brits have items of clothing they think they are now too old to wear - although 15 per cent also own pieces they think they are too young for. Around one third of Brits are self-proclaimed ‘followers of fashion’.

And in a sense they are – although that loved one is their former home, now a heap of rubble piled next to the devastated al-Nuri mosque in Mosul’s once-beautiful old town. They weep when they see it and they are not alone. Down the road, another man cries beside his wrecked house. The Yosifs’ explanation for coming is simple: “Because there is nothing better than home.”  We meet them in Iraq’s second-biggest city a year on from its liberation from Is\u0026shy\u0026shylamic State’s three-year occupation. This was the brutal jihadis’ last bastion – the place where their leader proclaimed his caliphate in the mosque. IS clung on bitterly as Iraqi and Kurdish forces and coalition air strikes blasted Mosul to powdery oblivion. An estimated 40,000 lives were lost 70% of the city was destroyed.  In the old town, skeletal remains of homes sag above our heads, their once-hidden innards twisted and exposed like those of the corpses that still rot within. Endless piles of stone are churned with rem\u0026shy\u0026shynants of family life – a rug, a basket, a child’s shoe perhaps lost mid-flight. As the battle raged for three months, the Yosifs hid with 53 others in an ancient cave. There was no light they ate only wheat with water snatched perilously from the mosque’s well. There was no space to lie down, no toilet.  Mum Hiam, 43, was pregnant. Her beautiful daughters Ahlaa, nine, and Masra, eight, were terrified of the dark. She recalls: “We lost weight, our skin was scaly and itchy. It smelt terrible. The bombs fell and finally we could not breathe for dust. IS wanted the cave but we refused. They threatened to burn us. But we had no hope anyway.” Finally forced out into the bombs and bullets days before liberation, they wept with relief when they saw Iraqi soldiers. In a refugee camp weeks later, Hiam gave birth to daughter Ellen. She weighed just 1kg.  Her face terribly aged, she says: “She was fighting for life.” Incredibly, Ellen won that battle. The family now rent a half-built house in the east of the city. Their only surviving possession, discovered in the rubble, is a wardrobe. Hiam smiles: “There is no money to rebuild yet we have faith we will return. We have hope now.” It is because of this fierce determination that the old town is starting to breathe again.

Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate. The roads office has a fantastic team but they are fighting a losing battle.\"With regards to the funding formula, Mr MacWilliam said he was continuing to press the matter but he faced strong opposition from the much larger number of Highland councillors who represent rural wards.However, residents in Milton Crescent are just happy that work there is finally going ahead.Edward Dyce (76) relies on his vehicle to get around and said: \"I have had a lot of problems with my car because of the road surface. It\u0027 getting worse because of the amount of traffic.\"A lot of people use the road and the potholes have become a real problem.

I really enjoyed the day and it was great to share some of my experiences as a player and a coach with the two schools.”Hazlehead head teacher Barbara Jones said: “All the pupils had a discussion as part of the curriculum about who they would want to join them on the day, and then they selected someone that they were interested in, motivated and inspired by.“It’s a great experience for them to have someone who is at the pinnacle of his career, especially with the success of the team this year, come and talk to them. We need the positive role models, and he spoke to them about how you deal with things when they don’t work out the way you wanted. It was really helpful.”Councillor John Cooke, who was at the Hazlehead assembly, said: “I’d have enjoyed going to the assembly anyway, because I really like the ethos of the school around pushing kids to fulfil their potential, but it was a real bonus to meet Gregor.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency services respond to underground explosion in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPolice and fire services are responding to a major incident in Dundee’s Greenmarket area.Local people have reported hearing a loud explosion at around 8.30am and emergency services were quick to reach the scene.A cordon has been thrown up and onlookers asked to stay well back, according to one witness.Police said buildings in the area had been evacuated as a precaution.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/Dogs-die-in-hot-cars-398x564.jpg ","title":"more than 10 people every day have called the sspca worried about dogs in hot cars","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Scottish SPCA has seen a major increase in the number of calls for people concerned about dogs in hot cars.In just 16 days, between June 18 and July 4, there were 210 calls from members of the public.And over the past year the charity has seen an 80% increase in the number of calls on this issue.Scottish SPCA chief superintendent Mike Flynn said: \u0026#8220We\u0026#8217re very concerned at the number of reports we\u0026#8217re receiving about dogs being left inside cars during the hot weather.\u0026#8220Owners need to understand that it\u0026#8217s completely unacceptable to leave a dog in a vehicle in these searing temperatures, even for a short period of time with the windows down.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"no more overnight closures at strone point","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/07/18, 3:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe second of two nights of planned closure on the A83 trunk road will no longer be needed.The closures \u0026#8211 on Wednesday and Thursday July 4/5 \u0026#8211 were planned to allow resurfacing work at the Strone Point realignment project, near Inveraray.Trunk road management firm BEAR Scotland announced on Thursday afternoon that the works carried out during the Wednesday overnight closure had progressed well, and the surface course of the new carriageway has now been completed.A spokesperson added: \u0026#8216No further road closures will be required during the remainder of these improvement works with traffic management now reverting back to a two way temporary traffic light set up for the final aspects of the project.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert expects no sewage running down streets","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/07/18, 2:18 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe reason for raw sewage running down Tarbert’s streets is under investigation.On Thursday June 28,  sewage was seen bubbling up through drain covers and running along the kerbsides on Harbour  Street.The cause of the discharge is as yet unknown, but investigations are under way.A Scottish Water spokesman said: \u0026#8216Our sewer response team carried out an investigation after reports of a discharge at a surface water pipe at this location.‘This involved using CCTV cameras to try and ascertain what caused this discharge.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Isabelle Cairns, of Ayr, has hit out at the amount of rubbish being left on the beach. And the Financial Adviser feels that the council could do more. Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now? It’s a ghost town. “There is not a lot about, but the beach is an attraction that brings in people from all over the country. “Walking along the beach seeing this mess was nothing short of disgusting. “It gets to me as it’s such a beautiful beach. “What you also have to think about is that all kinds of rubbish is going to be washed out to sea when the tide comes in.  “It’s just going to get even worse going forward as the schools are now off. “More people will be going to the beach and it’s just going to become an absolute travesty. “People have no respect for the beach, but the council should have someone cleaning up when it’s like that.” A council spokesman said: “We monitor our beaches closely and work within the national guidance and with available resources to keep our beaches looking their best, so they can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike. “We clean and litter-pick the full stretch of Ayr Beach and ask people to dispose of their waste in our bins rather than abandoning rubbish on the sand. “The section from Cromwell Road to the Pier is not routinely mechanically cleaned as it’s classed as an amenity beach rather than a recreational beach, but the stretch is still managed on a regular basis.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lane closure inspection station hotel","story":"NewsLane closure as inspection at Station HotelGable end of the building to be investigated\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning17:58, 6 JUL 2018Updated18:03, 6 JUL 2018NewsFront entrance to Ayr railway station is blocked off (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne lane of the A70 will be shut off to allow for an inspecton of the gable wall of the Station Hotel just off Burns Statute Square. In order to carry out the inspection, one lane of the A70 which runs over the railway bridge towards Holmston Road and Station Road will be closed temporarily from tomorrow (7th July 2018). The section of the pavement which runs adjacent to the road will also be closed on a temporary basis. The inspection to assess the gable end will form part of the overall structural survey which the Council is undertaking to obtain a detailed report on the condition of the building. Trains are expected to run as normal, however the temporary pavement closure may affect passengers making their way to and from platform 4. Since the closure of the main entrance, some passengers have been using the pavement next to the A70 as an alternative route.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep.

Do not engage with callers of this type and please call police on 101 or 999 in an emergency to report.\n\"Please look out for neighbours who may be vulnerable and report any suspicious activity to us.\n\"Bogus callers will travel significant distances to commit this type of crime and tend to target the more vulnerable in our communities.\"\nHere are some tips on how to protect yourself from Bogus Callers:\n\u0026bull Be on guard if someone turns up unexpectedly.\n\u0026bull Keep front and back doors locked.\n\u0026bull Use the door viewer or nearby window when answering the door.\n\u0026bull Fit a door chain or bar \u0026ndash use it and keep it on when talking to callers at the door.\n\u0026bull If you\u0026rsquore not sure, don\u0026rsquot answer the door.\n\u0026bull Don\u0026rsquot feel embarrassed - genuine callers expect you to be careful.\n\u0026bull Only let callers in if they have an appointment and you have confirmed they are genuine.\n\u0026bull Always ask for identification badges of anyone you answer the door to, but don\u0026rsquot rely on them. Identity cards can be faked \u0026ndash phone the company to verify their identity.\n\u0026bull Some companies offer a password system. Ask your utility providers if this can be used and if you have a password with a company make sure the caller uses it.\n\u0026bull Never let people try to persuade you to let them into your home even if they are asking for help \u0026ndash they may not be genuine. If someone is persistent, ask them to call at another time and arrange for a friend or family member to be with you.\n\u0026bull Never agree to pay for goods or give money to strangers who arrive at your door.\n\u0026bull Don\u0026rsquot keep large amounts of money in your home.\n\u0026bull Remember, it\u0026rsquos your home. There\u0026rsquos no reason why anyone should ever enter your home against your wishes.\n\u0026bull If you\u0026rsquore not sure, don\u0026rsquot answer the door.\nFor more information, visit the Police Scotland website or contact your local community officer on 101.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"all-the-key-details-about-theresa-mays-brexit-plan","story":"Here are some of the key details contained in the Government\u0026rsquos summary of the Brexit plan Theresa May\u0026rsquos Cabinet agreed at Chequers.\nAt the core of the proposal is the establishment of a \u0026ldquofree trade area for goods to \u0026ldquoavoid friction at the border, protect jobs and livelihoods, and ensure both sides meet their commitments to\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland and Ireland.\nDetails of the plan include:\n\u0026ndash The UK and EU agreeing a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook for all goods including agri-foods, with British ministers committing in a treaty to ongoing harmonisation with Brussels\u0026rsquo rules necessary to provide for frictionless trade at ports and the border with Ireland.\nThere was a heavy security presence for the Cabinet meeting (Steve Parsons/PA)\n\u0026ndash The UK Parliament would have the ability to choose not to incorporate future rules, but accepts there would be \u0026ldquoconsequences for trade.\n\u0026ndash There would be \u0026ldquoregulatory flexibility for services, with the UK recognising that would mean neither side enjoying \u0026ldquocurrent levels of access to each other\u0026rsquos markets.\n\u0026ndash A common rulebook on state aid would be agreed, preventing either side from subsidising their own industries, with co-operation between competition watchdogs on either side of the English Channel.\n\u0026ndash The UK will commit to maintaining high environmental, climate change, social, employment and consumer protection standards.\n\u0026ndash\u0026nbsp A joint institutional framework will be established to oversee UK-EU agreements, with the UK agreeing to pay \u0026ldquodue regard to EU case law in areas where the common rulebook applies.\n\u0026ndash A \u0026ldquofacilitated customs agreement would remove the need for customs checks by treating the UK and EU \u0026ldquoas if a combined customs territory.\n\u0026ndash The UK would apply the EU\u0026rsquos tariffs and trade policy for goods intended for the bloc but would be able to control its own tariffs and trade for the domestic market, with the plan being phased in as both sides complete the necessary preparations.\nMinisters claimed the plan would result in an \u0026ldquoambitious relationship that nonetheless respected the UK\u0026rsquos sovereignty and the EU\u0026rsquos autonomy.\nChannel Five Political Editor Andy Bell reports from a field near Chequers (Stefan Rousseau/PA)\nBenefits claimed for the plan include:\n\u0026ndash Frictionless access for goods, protecting supply chains the the just-in-time model used by major manufacturers such as carmakers.\n\u0026ndash Avoiding the need for a border between Northern Ireland and Ireland or within the UK.\n\u0026ndash Allowing the UK to have an independent trade policy, with the potential to join countries including Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada in Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership\u0026nbsp(CPTPP).\n\u0026ndash Ending free movement \u0026ldquogiving the UK back control over how many people enter the country.\n\u0026ndash Ending \u0026ldquovast annual payments to the EU budget, although \u0026ldquoappropriate contributions will still be made for joint programmes in specific areas.\nMinisters also acknowledged that \u0026ldquoit was responsible to continue preparations for a range of potential outcomes,

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

Campbeltown, appeared from custody before Sheriff Patrick Hughes, charged with behaving in a threatening or abusive manner, likely to cause a reasonable person to suffer fear or alarm, by shouting, throwing a shopping trolley and breaking a window at an address in Campbeltown on June 10.During his trial, two witnesses gave evidence.The first witness, whose house is on the opposite side of the street to where the offences were alleged to have taken place, said she heard a commotion on the date in question and looked out of her window to see what was happening.She said she saw Deavy outside the other house, shouting, but she could not see if there was anyone else present.She came away from the window but 15 minutes later, when she heard \u0026#8216a smash\u0026#8217, she returned to see if anyone was hurt and saw Deavy leaving the property\u0026#8217s garden, \u0026#8216still angry\u0026#8217, she said.She said he threw a trolley that was in the garden to the side.Deavy\u0026#8217s defence solicitor, Mr Buchanan, asked the witness if what she had heard had just been an argument between two people, and if the two were \u0026#8216giving as good as they got\u0026#8217.The witness said that although she heard two voices, she could not hear what they were saying.The second witness, whose window was smashed, said Deavy had been taken to her property in a state of intoxication.Although he was usually welcome, she asked him to leave because he was drunk.When he did not, she decided to leave the property and go for a walk around the block and when she returned, Deavy was gone.When he returned later, the witness pretended she was not in.She said Deavy was chapping the door but she had closed the curtains.At some point she heard a bang and thought that Deavy may have fallen into the wheelie bins outside, but when she went to check she saw that the shopping trolley was over on its side, near to where it had been before.She said: \u0026#8216I sat in silence so he would think I was still away out.\u0026#8217Later, the woman went shopping and when she returned home, she found her window smashed so she called the police.She said that she would not have phoned the police about the earlier events if the window had not been smashed.Mr Buchanan said there was \u0026#8216no evidence at all\u0026#8217 of swearing or violence, and that there was nothing to suggest his knocking on her door was untoward.He said it had been \u0026#8216a drunk man, knocking at the door of a property at which he was welcome.\u0026#8217Procurator fiscal depute Eoin McGinty said it \u0026#8216could not have been any clearer that he was not welcome\u0026#8217 and cited the witness walking around the block and closing her curtains to avoid Deavy.Finding the charge against Deavy not proven, Sheriff Hughes said he thought the accused probably broke the window but there was insufficient evidence to prove it beyond reasonable doubt.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltowns european drum major champion","story":"Last Saturday, Campbeltown drum major Liam Renton, 25, won his second European title: 2018 European Adult Drum

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.

As soon as the discharge was detected, the process was \u0026ldquoimmediately shut down but \u0026ldquounfortunately some dust had already escaped into the atmosphere, said Tarmac.  The dry weather and wind direction resulted in the dust being carried towards Dunbar.

Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"  When the final of this year\u0026rsquos Scottish Black Pudding Championship was held earlier this month at the Edinburgh New Town Cook School, it was Anderson\u0027s Quality Butchers who came out on top.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.

The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen.

Handfuls of tickets were available just days before the game and it is unclear if suggestions of a surge in online interest in bookings will result in larger crowd numbers than at previous games such as against Tunisia, when England fans\u0026rsquo attendance was said to be the lowest for 30 years.

In the tiny courtroom packed with current and former lawyers and associates of Lee, lawyer Tom Lallas asked for a 30-day extension of the temporary restraining order he had received against Lee\u0026rsquos former manager Keya Morgan.  Mr Lallas has said in legal documents and news releases in recent weeks that he was representing Lee.  Superior Court Judge Pro Tem Ruth Kleman refused to consider the motion, saying it appeared Mr Lallas was not employed by Lee.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom only concerned who has authority to represent Mr Lee, judge Kleman said.  Lee\u0026rsquos daughter and only child, JC Lee, sat in court and smiled at her lawyers when the judge refused to recognise Mr Lallas. Lawyers working with her had provided a signed declaration from Stan Lee denouncing Mr Lallas.  The hearing came on the anniversary of the death of Joan Lee, Stan Lee\u0026rsquos wife of nearly 70 years.  The latest Marvel film featuring Lee\u0026rsquos characters, Ant-Man And The Wasp, was released in the US on Friday and is expected to top the weekend box office.  The new restraining order against Morgan, a 42-year-old movie producer who had worked as Lee\u0026rsquos manager and personal adviser, demands that he keep away from Lee, Lee\u0026rsquos daughter and Lee\u0026rsquos brother.  The request for the order alleges that Morgan has attempted to interfere with Lee\u0026rsquos ability to contact caregivers, doctors and family members, has attempted to alienate Lee from his daughter, and is embezzling or misappropriating five million dollars-worth of Lee\u0026rsquos assets.  Lee\u0026rsquos new lawyers said they would also work with police and prosecutors in an elder-abuse investigation involving Morgan.  Morgan told The Associated Press that he was in New York working on a film. He declined to comment further on the advice of his lawyer but has previously denied abusing Lee in any way.  Morgan\u0026rsquos lawyer Alex Kessel did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the allegations in the new order.  Stan Lee\u0026rsquos declaration said he had fired Mr Lallas in February and had no desire to be further represented by him.  It also said Morgan had likely committed malpractice by disclosing to media and others his opinions about Lee\u0026rsquos health and personal life.  It said that he had no desire for Mr Lallas to file for a restraining order in his name.  \u0026ldquoMr Lallas has done enough damage already, the document says. \u0026ldquoHopefully, he will just stop.  The document includes Lee\u0026rsquos original request that Mr Lallas be fired, signed, \u0026ldquoExcelsior! Stan Lee.

We stayed there and we all met for meals, we all were in the common room in the evening, and we learned from each other.  \"Weekends usually started at lunchtime on the Saturday. We didn\u0027t think about \u0027contractual hours\u0027 - I don\u0027t remember ever signing a contract. We just did what needed to be done.\"  Speaking at his home in Morningside, Edinburgh, the retired physician said the NHS he joined in 1949 was a very different place to the NHS of 2018.  \"The spectrum of disease then was entirely different to what it is now,\" he said. \"When I was a student, tuberculosis was rife and for example if a child came in with a diagnosis of meningitis-tuberculosis, it was a death sentence.  \"Then at the beginning of being a house officer, streptomycin came in - and it was a miracle. They survived.\"  Read more NHS 70: The transformation of maternity care - and the return of home births?\u0026nbsp  Dr Boyd said the levels of poverty he encountered as a young medic in Edinburgh are also long gone. As a student, he spent a period assisting at home births in the Leith area with midwives.  \"That was an occasion where I was first confronted with real poverty. Some of the worst slums in Scotland were in Leith. Often there would be nowhere to put the baby except in an empty drawer, and sometimes there wasn\u0027t very much food.  \"I remember one occasion where the delivery was quite prolonged. The men vanished, of course - off to the pub or wherever - and it was either a neighbour or a female relative who was around. They\u0027d be offered a cup of tea and that was it.  \"Anyway, it was going on and on and the student midwife said \u0027I\u0027m getting really hungry\u0027. So we pooled our resources - the midwife and myself - and I went out and got fish suppers.  \"And we all - the poor mother-to-be, the attendants, myself - we all ate fish suppers. It was probably the best meal she had had in a long time.  \"I didn\u0027t come from a posh family, but I\u0027d never encountered poverty like that.  \"I shared with a very good friend of mine, another medical student, and when we came back from these places the drill was that we went straight back to our bedroom, put a newspaper down, stripped and started to look for the \u0027wildlife\u0027. There was everything: fleas, lice, bedbugs. That\u0027s something not seen nowadays.\"  Read more NHS 70: Has psychiatry gone from overcrowded asylums to a shortage of beds?\u0026nbsp  However, Dr Boyd laments the rise of a \"culture of blame\" in the NHS over the decades.  He said: \"There were difficulties then when I was younger, but there is a difference in attitude. Things went wrong in those days as well, of course, but they didn\u0027t have the climate of blame and fear of doing something wrong and being blamed and sued for it. That didn\u0027t exist.  \"Another disease you don\u0027t see now is polio myelitis. Now I can remember as a house physician admitting a young male psychiatrist from the local psychiatric hospital at Larbert, with acute polio myelitis. He progressed very rapidly to the extent that his respiratory muscles were affected.  \"Now in the 1930s Lord Nuffield - the \u0027Morris\u0027 of the Morris cars, and at that time a millionaire - he had gone round the hospitals in the UK presenting what was known as an \u0027iron lung\u0027. These were the old negative pressure respirators. It was like getting into a coffin - you were enclosed in there with a seal round the neck, and just your head exposed.  \"Well, Falkirk Royal had an iron lung. I had never had training in using it and I don\u0027t think any of the other staff had either. It was just there, ready for use, but it never had been used.  \"I remember that being a very traumatic experience, and the poor chap died afterwards. I had never seen a team of nurses cry before but we were all very distressed. That\u0027s one of the bad things I remember.  \"But nobody said \u0027why did this man die?\u0027. The attitude was from relatives \u0027thank you doctor for doing all you did\u0027. It was different.\"  Following his National Service in Nigeria, Dr Boyd worked at various hospitals including the Eastern General Hospital in Edinburgh, where he was based in the department of respiratory disease alongside Sir John Crofton, the famous pioneer of the \u0027Edinburgh Method\u0027 which helped eradicate tuberculosis.  \"He was a fantastic man,\" said Dr Boyd. \"He was not only a brilliant physician and researcher, but he was a very humane man.\"  Later, seeking a consultant post, Dr Boyd became the first ever consultant physician employed by the NHS in Caithness and Sutherland when he took up a post at Caithness Central Hospital in 1964.  He was tasked with setting up the region\u0027s first acute medical unit, which served a population of around 35,000-40,000 people. Besides Dr Boyd and his senior house officer, the staff consisted of one consultant surgeon, a consultant obstetrician, an anaesthetist and a GP.  Dr Boyd said: \"It was fine, but I found the isolation as a consultant hospital doctor something which worried me. I\u0027d always been in the situation where if there was problems you always had somebody to spark off - but there was nobody.  \"I began to think \u0027I\u0027m going to develop a God Almighty syndrome here\u0027, that everything I say is correct. I missed that contact, so I came back to Edinburgh in 1970.\"  The remainder of his career, until he retired from clinical work in 1988, was spent in the capital.  More recently, he has experienced the NHS as a patient - having coronary stents and a pacemaker fitted - but also through his granddaughter, who is a GP.  \"Her stories of pressure on beds - I don\u0027t remember that quite so much,\" said Dr Boyd. \"We were certainly busy and we worked long hours, but we enjoyed them. We didn\u0027t have the problem of the elderly so much though. Being 75 back then - you were really old. Being 91, as I am, that was unheard of.\""},{"url":null,"title":"tiny-sir-walter-scott-watercolour-is-thought-to-be-undiscovered-turner","story":"  The postcard-sized picture of the Scottish author depicts him and his family at their Abbotsford home, near Tweedbank in the Borders.  It was bought by the Abbotsford Trust after it was discovered in a London auction house by trust members who became intrigued by the possibility it was by the famous English Romantic artist.  If the painting is authenticated as a Turner, it will be worth millions.  One of the last of the artist\u0027s masterpieces which remained in private hands set a world auction record when it sold in 2014 for \u0026pound30.3 million.  Turner, who first explored the Borders, aged 22 in 1797, met the Ivanhoe-author several times.  It is thought the small painting, which is 5.5 inches by 3.5 inches, was created during a visit he made to Abbotsford in the summer of 1831.  It is currently on show at the Abbostford museum \u0026mdash situated in the writer\u0027s former home \u0026mdash in an exhibition entitled Turner and Scott: The Painter and the Poet.  The trust is now supporting ongoing research into the painting, with researchers and scientists analysing the work.  As written in the Scotsman, the painting has been subjected to pigment analysis and infrared imaging in an attempt to establish its provenance.  Kirsty Archer-Thompson, collections and interpretation manager for the trust and curator of the exhibition, said: \"This painting is, quite frankly, electric.  \"Everything about it, from the minutiae in the detail and the use of scraping out highlights, to the evolution of its composition from pencil sketch to painting - a whole world only visible through infrared scanning - suggests to me that it is not the work of a copyist.  \"All of this analysis, including work by painting analysis expert Libby Sheldon, demonstrates that it was executed by an astonishingly skilled hand.  \"Turner was a master of these highly intricate and delicate watercolour illustrations, two of which are already owned by the Abbotsford Trust.  \"Everything about this little painting feels authentic and consistent with the great man. I hope that we can prove the theory with the help and support of enthusiasts and experts in the art world.\"  Trust chairman James Holloway, a former director of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, said: \"It is wonderful for Abbotsford to be able to show such a fascinating painting.  \"It will intrigue and delight our visitors. To think that we are publicly displaying the watercolour for the very first time since it was painted by Turner is also tremendously exciting.\"  If found to be genuine, the painting may be an early version of another painting of Abbotsford used as the inspiration for an engraving published in Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, a commemorative biography published after the writer\u0027s death."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-government-urged-to-reconsider-rejection-of-glasgow-safe-injection-room","story":"  Council leader Susan Aitken and city convener for health and social care, Mhairi Hunter, responded to the Home Office following its refusal of the policy.  It only just preceded the announcement that Scotland has the highest drug-related death rates in Europe \u0026ndash around 30 per cent are in Glasgow.  A safer drugs consumption facility (SDCF) would help tackle the problem that killed more than 200 in the city last year, its proponents believe.  The letter to Victoria Atkins MP, Under Secretary of State for Crime, stated: \u0026ldquoWe note that other countries have successfully introduced DCRs within strict legislative frameworks similar to those that operate in the UK.  The UK Government had referred to addicts travelling from Sweden to Jutland, Denmark, to use a similar clinic.  But the councillors told how the chance of people travelling to Glasgow for the facility was unlikely due to the low income and homeless demographic that would use it.  No change to the current laws concerning supply of heroin is being sought by the council.  Special training and strict protocols will be in place for staff working in the centre.  Given the rise in drug deaths, all parties in the council are supportive of the plan.  In 2017, 934 drug-related deaths were recorded in Scotland, an eight per cent increase on 2016.  The figure is going up and up every year on average since 1997, when just 200 deaths were recorded.  The overwhelming majority are related to heroin, according to the National Records of Scotland.  Ms Hunter and Ms Aitken\u0026rsquos letter added: \u0026ldquoIn terms of day to day ethical dilemmas, clinicians employed in such a service will have considerable experience of working with drug users and will operate within their existing codes of professional practice.  \u0026ldquoWe have around 30 years of experience within Glasgow of running needle exchanges, opiate replacement therapy and outreach services to drug users, and therefore a significant body of existing knowledge, experience and transferrable skills.  At a recent council meeting, Ms Hunter said: \u0026ldquo[The letter] from the Home Office was actually a lot more positive than it might have first appeared... I think the first time we\u0026rsquove seen the Home Office acknowledge the benefits of the facility."},{"url":null,"title":"forensic-investigators-step-up-search-for-novichok-source","story":"  Ms Sturgess, 44, and her partner, Charlie Rowley, 45, remain in a critical condition after being taken ill on Saturday in Amesbury, Wiltshire.  There has been much speculation around how the couple came across the contaminated item, with police yet to locate the source of the chemical weapon.  One theory is that the pair found the substance in a container or vial or syringe which was used to transport the nerve agent in the attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, before being discarded.  Other reports say that they may have came across it through picking up a contaminated cigarette end.  Mr Rowley has been described as having foraged for goods to fix and sell, and is known to have collected discarded cigarettes.  A government scientist has told the BBC that the item was unlikely to have been left in the open before they touched it, before adding that the Novichok was so toxic it was able to pass through the skin and did not need to be ingested.  Police said they have not ruled out more people falling ill from coming into contact with the substance which was used on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in March.  It has been identified as the same nerve agent used in the Skripal attack, but it is not yet known if it is from the same batch.  Yesterday, forensic investigators in hazardous material suits and gas masks searched John Baker House, a hostel in Salisbury where mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess was living.  They were seen to collect a number of samples after they took one from the outside of the building shortly after 3pm.  At one point one investigator was seen to carry a large blue bin from the property.  Wiltshire residents have been told to expect investigators in hazardous material suits to descend on the scenes, while other sites the couple were known to have visited before being taken ill are behind cordons.  Mr Rowley\u0027s flat in Amesbury, where they were both taken ill, also has a heavy, operational presence.  Incident response vehicles and fire engines joined police at his Amesbury home.  Dan Kaszeta, a former chemical and biological weapons adviser to the White House and the Secret Service, told the New York Times that the object police are looking for may be a crucial piece of evidence,  \"Were the guys who did this given more than they needed?\"  \"The container may even have fingerprints on it, it\u0026rsquos a smoking gun, he said.  \"But killers sometimes leave a smoking gun at the scene of a crime.\"  It is the second nerve agent emergency in four months prompted a diplomatic row, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid accusing the Russian state of using Britain as a \"dumping ground for poison\".  The Russian Embassy hit back, accusing the Government of trying to \"muddy the waters\" and \"frighten its own citizens\"."},{"url":null,"title":"chequers-talks-cabinet-agrees-to-uk-european-union-free-trade-area-for-goods","story":"  Plans have been thrashed out by ministers and Theresa May after meeting for the day at Chequers.  The Prime Minister had summoned senior ministers to decide on the UK\u0027s future relationship with Brussels.  The entire Cabinet, including ministers who are not full members but attend meetings, arrived one by one by car at Chequers on Friday morning in time for discussions to start at 10am.  In a three-page document released this evening, the agreed plans state that the ministers had \"agreed to a more developed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcomprehensive proposal for\u0026nbspthe \u0026nbspeconomic partnership. \u0026nbsp  At \u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspcore of\u0026nbspthis\u0026nbspproposal is\u0026nbspthe establishment \u0026nbspby\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspUK\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspEU\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspfree\u0026nbsptrade\u0026nbsparea\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspgoods,\" it read.  Under the Government\u0027s plans the UK would be free to diverge from EU rules over services, a major part of the British economy, with ministers acknowledging this will reduce the levels of access available to European markets.  Brussels will be reluctant to consider any plan which would risk splitting the single market, and ministers appeared to acknowledge this by agreeing to step up preparations for a \"no deal\" Brexit.  Mrs May said she hoped the proposals would enable talks with the EU to move forward.  Going into Chequers the Prime Minister was under pressure as the Cabinet was split, with Brexit Secretary David Davis understood to have major reservations about both the plan and whether Brussels would even consider it seriously.  But it is understood that all members of the Cabinet have signed up to the proposals and none of them have decided to quit rather than back the plan.  The \"common rulebook\" for goods could reduce the UK\u0027s flexibility to strike trade deals with other countries, particularly the US which would want an agreement allowing its farm products, produced to different standards, into the British market.  It would also involve the UK paying \"due regard\" to European Court of Justice rulings relating to the rules Britain will share with Brussels, potentially softening the Prime Minister\u0027s red line on the jurisdiction of judges in Luxembourg.  But the Prime Minister said the Cabinet had agreed a \"collective position\" on the future of the negotiations with the EU.  \"Our proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products,\" she said.  \"This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.  \"As a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.  \"We have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world. \"  Elements of the plan, which will be formally presented in a White Paper next week, were revealed in a three-page summary.  They include:  - The UK committing to \"ongoing harmonisation\" with EU rules on goods to ensure frictionless trade at ports and the border with Ireland  - A \"joint institutional framework\" would provide for the consistent interpretation and application of UK-EU agreements, with British courts ruling on cases in Britain and EU courts in the EU but a joint committee and independent arbitration settling disputes  - A new \"facilitated customs arrangement\" would remove the need for checks and controls by treating the UK and EU as if they were a \"combined customs territory\"  - The UK would effectively impose EU tariffs at the border for goods intended for the bloc but would \"control its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world\"  - Free movement of people will end, but a \"mobility framework\" will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other\u0027s territories and apply to study or work  Mrs May said: \"Next week we will be publishing a White Paper which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.  \"Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.\"  Ahead of the formal announcement of the deal, Tory Brexiteers warned that Mrs May\u0027s position could be under threat if she watered down her red lines.  Leading Brexiteer David Jones, a former minister at Mr Davis\u0027s Department for Exiting the EU, said the proposed deal breached all three of Mrs May\u0027s red lines of leaving the single market, customs union and jurisdiction of the ECJ.  Describing the plan as \"not very good at all\", Mr Jones told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today that it would deliver \"something less than the full Brexit we have had repeated promises of by the PM and Cabinet members\".  Andrea Jenkyns, who quite as a ministerial aide in order to speak more freely about Brexit, said she would be willing to help trigger a leadership contest if the deal left the UK \"one foot in, one foot out\" of the EU.  \"I am not a hypocrite,\" the Morley and Outwood MP said in an interview recorded for the BBC\u0027s Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.  \"I am standing up for the 17.4 million people who wanted these red lines and who wanted to ensure we did not have a half in-half out Brexit.\"  And Stewart Jackson, a former MP now the senior aide to the Brexit Secretary, tweeted a link to a story about a poll warning that \"Tories will lose votes if they cross Brexit red lines\"."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-defies-odds-and-secures-cabinet-deal-on-brexit-strategy","story":"  Amid talk of mass resignations, the Prime Minister performed a political high-wire act to finally agree a deal to align Britain\u0026rsquos rules with the rest of Europe on goods, including agricultural produce a move set to confound her critics and infuriate hard Brexiteers, who claimed this would make the UK a \u0026ldquovassal state of the EU.  After almost 12 hours of thrashing out the pros and cons of her proposed customs plan during a Cabinet away-day in her country retreat at Chequers, Mrs May issued a dramatic statement.  She said: \u0026ldquoToday in detailed discussions, the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU.  \u0026ldquoOur proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area, which establishes a common rule-book for industrial goods and agricultural products. This maintains high standards in these areas but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.  \u0026ldquoAs a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.  She went on: \u0026ldquoWe have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world.  \u0026ldquoNext week we will be publishing a White Paper, which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.  \u0026ldquoNow we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve, added Mrs May, who is expected to make a Commons statement on Monday to set out in detail to MPs her proposed way forward on Brexit.  Despite talk of possible resignations by the likes of Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, and David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, none had materialised.  Earlier, Nicola Sturgeon suggested how the best outcome of the Chequers summit would have been the resignation of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquohard Brexiteers as this might have signalled a \u0026ldquoglimmer of hope that common sense starts to prevail.  The First Minister warned the worst outcome would be if Mrs May\u0026rsquos colleagues emerged \u0026ldquoarm in arm, saying they\u0027ve agreed, because that means there\u0027s another helping of fudge being served up.  She added if the outcome of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos marathon session was simply an agreement that satisfied the apparently irreconcilable wings of the Tory government, then the \u0026ldquodanger is\u0026hellipthat it will be dead on arrival in Brussels and we will be no further forward in reaching agreement\" with the EU27.  Over a dinner of whiskey and treacle-cured Scottish salmon, Mrs May and her senior colleagues put the finishing touches to their Cabinet deal, which some colleagues and pundits believed impossible. Talk among Brexiteers beforehand had claimed that the PM\u0026rsquos facilitated customs arrangement \u0026ndash a hybrid of the two previous options \u0026ndash was \u0026ldquonot full Brexit and that regulatory alignment with the EU on goods would prevent the UK from striking its own future trade deals.  However, perhaps in a key sign of the agreement to come, Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, broke off from a meeting of Brexiteers on Thursday night, organised by Mr Johnson at the Foreign Office, to have private talks with the PM, who sought to reassure him that under her compromise plan future trade deals would be possible. He emerged \u0026ldquocontent with her plan.  Key now will be how Brussels reacts. Earlier, Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, said that he was ready to adapt the EU27\u0027s stance in response to any changes to the UK\u0027s \"red lines\".  Meanwhile, it emerged at a meeting at London\u0026rsquos Carlton Club on Thursday night, David Cameron persuaded Mr Johnson not to resign, saying Mrs May\u0026rsquos third-way customs plan was the only one the Commons would accept.  While the PM was thrashing out her plan with colleagues at Chequers, her predecessor was watching thrashing of a sporting kind.  Mr Cameron was looking tanned and relaxed in a smart suit and sunglasses in the Royal Box at Wimbledon alongside his mother Mary and a previous Foreign Secretary, Lord Hague."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8035370.jpg?type=article-full","title":"bbcs-gracie-gives-tips-to-help-aspiring-journalists-at-future-news-conference","story":"  Carrie Gracie was among top media figures who took part in the Future News Worldwide event, which was held at the Scottish Parliament.

Mr Lallas has said in legal documents and news releases in recent weeks that he was representing Lee.  Superior Court Judge Pro Tem Ruth Kleman refused to consider the motion, saying it appeared Mr Lallas was not employed by Lee.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom only concerned who has authority to represent Mr Lee, judge Kleman said.  Lee\u0026rsquos daughter and only child, JC Lee, sat in court and smiled at her lawyers when the judge refused to recognise Mr Lallas. Lawyers working with her had provided a signed declaration from Stan Lee denouncing Mr Lallas.  The hearing came on the anniversary of the death of Joan Lee, Stan Lee\u0026rsquos wife of nearly 70 years.  The latest Marvel film featuring Lee\u0026rsquos characters, Ant-Man And The Wasp, was released in the US on Friday and is expected to top the weekend box office.  The new restraining order against Morgan, a 42-year-old movie producer who had worked as Lee\u0026rsquos manager and personal adviser, demands that he keep away from Lee, Lee\u0026rsquos daughter and Lee\u0026rsquos brother.  The request for the order alleges that Morgan has attempted to interfere with Lee\u0026rsquos ability to contact caregivers, doctors and family members, has attempted to alienate Lee from his daughter, and is embezzling or misappropriating five million dollars-worth of Lee\u0026rsquos assets.  Lee\u0026rsquos new lawyers said they would also work with police and prosecutors in an elder-abuse investigation involving Morgan.  Morgan told The Associated Press that he was in New York working on a film. He declined to comment further on the advice of his lawyer but has previously denied abusing Lee in any way.  Morgan\u0026rsquos lawyer Alex Kessel did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the allegations in the new order.  Stan Lee\u0026rsquos declaration said he had fired Mr Lallas in February and had no desire to be further represented by him.  It also said Morgan had likely committed malpractice by disclosing to media and others his opinions about Lee\u0026rsquos health and personal life.  It said that he had no desire for Mr Lallas to file for a restraining order in his name.  \u0026ldquoMr Lallas has done enough damage already, the document says. \u0026ldquoHopefully, he will just stop.  The document includes Lee\u0026rsquos original request that Mr Lallas be fired, signed, \u0026ldquoExcelsior! Stan Lee.  Mr Lallas said outside court that he stood by his assertion that he could act on Lee\u0026rsquos behalf, but he was glad at least that Lee\u0026rsquos other lawyers were moving to keep Morgan away from him."},{"url":null,"title":"dame-barbara-windsor-to-host-first-programme-since-revealing-alzheimers","story":"  The former EastEnders actress\u0026nbspand her husband, Scott Mitchell, revealed earlier this year that she was diagnosed in 2014.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Saturday 7 Jul 2018 4:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

This follows a wave of criticism towards bus services in the county, which saw members of the public brand Stagecoach \u0026#8220a disgrace.\u0026#8221The hearing was called to consider failings in relation to the provision of contracted school services and local bus services, many of which were caused by vehicle breakdowns. The traffic commissioner was concerned about the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and presentation.In particular she heard evidence from the Stagecoach Managing Director in Scotland, Mr Robert Andrew, who took the opportunity to apologise in public to OIC officials for the company’s failures. The inquiry also saw representatives from the council give evidence.After hearing this evidence, as well as making a visit to the bus operator’s Kirkwall depot, Miss Aitken also made an order to reduce the number of vehicles authorised on licence held by Highland Country Buses Ltd — the subsidiary of Stagecoach which serves the Highlands and Islands. Of the 210 vehicles which had been licensed, 30 will  now be unlicensed until Miss Aitken is satisfied with the compliance of the company to its licenses and contracts.In response to this, Stagecoach North Scotland managing director, David Liston, said: \u0026#8220We understand the importance of reliable and high-quality bus services to local communities in the Highlands and Islands.\u0026#8220Since these issues arose, we have taken steps to ensure that there are robust maintenance and operational processes in place across our business in the north of Scotland, and we are continuing to focus in particular on fleet reliability and presentation.\u0026#8220We understand the frustrations local people have at times expressed and we would like to reassure our customers that we are working hard to deliver better bus services. In her decision, the Traffic Commissioner has asked that we make a contribution totalling £20,500 to the schools in Orkney, and we are happy to do so.\u0026#8220We are currently arranging for this sum to be paid to Orkney Islands Council for onward payment to the schools.\u0026#8221The Traffic commissioner has clarified that this payment of  £20,500 is not compensatory in nature and does not affect any contractual obligations between the Council and Stagecoach. It is, rather, an ex gratia payment. The Traffic Commissioner decided on this course of action rather than ordering a payment to be made to Scottish Government.This sum is to be split between schools in the county:Orkney Islands Council has responded positively to this decision by the traffic commissioner.\u0026#8220We welcome the outcome of the public inquiry called by the Traffic Commissioner held in Kirkwall on June 5, particularly the decision to distribute the payment locally to our schools,\u0026#8221 a council spokeswoman said.\u0026#8220We’ll continue to work closely with the Traffic Commissioner and Stagecoach on service improvements.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to. Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos nieces and nephews from as far afield as the Canary Islands, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Sussex headed north for the event.Her birthday cake, baked by a relative, was shaped as an artist\u0026rsquos palette to represent one of her great passions in life.Mrs Foster was born in Surrey and spent her childhood with her three siblings in Kent, where her father had a grocery business.She started her working life in an office at a department store and then worked as a secretary mainly with legal firms, in England and Edinburgh.Mrs Foster said she and her husband Tony had been \"gradually moving up the country\" before settling in their cottage in Muir of Ord. Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

If dogs are being kept outdoors, they must have an area of shelter where they can escape the heat of the sun.”Among the advice for pet owners is to allow dogs access to paddling pools, and using damp blankets for them to lie on in the shade during hot weather. SSPCA Deputy Superintendent Peter Fleming went on to give general advice for pet owners, “In this hot weather we would advise the public to ensure their pets stay hydrated, cool and a fresh supply of water should always be available.“Sometimes just keeping a window open at home or putting on a fan to let the air circulate the room will help provide a cool temperature for them.“Please don’t forget about wild animals too, who will benefit from bowls of water left in the garden.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765408.1530888820!/image/image.jpg","title":"bay city roller to pay tribute to late bandmate at scotfest show","story":"        Bay City Roller Les McKeown plans to dedicate a song to his late bandmate as he plays in Scotland for the first time since his death.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4763516.1530642722!/image/image.jpg","title":"professor john elliott what scots and catalans can learn from history","story":"\t\tRelations between Catalonia and Madrid soured in the 1800s as the Romantic Movement took off and inspired a new kind of nationalism, writes John Elliott.\t\t\t\tAs the current generation of Scots and Catalans face up to unusually agonising decisions about the future they want for themselves and their children, it is perhaps salutary to take a step back and consider how and why this dilemma has arisen.            This is what I have tried to do in my book, Scots and Catalans. Union and Disunion, a comparative  history of two peoples without states of their own, whose attempts to define, reassess and perhaps transform their relationship to the larger polities to which they belong has been drawing headlines across the world.             The book begins with the Middle Ages and ends in December 2017 after the flight to Belgium of the Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, following the failure of a unilateral bid to break away from the Spanish state and establish Catalonia as an independent republic.Many years ago I wrote a study of the origins of the Catalan rebellion of 1640 against the royal government in Madrid – a rebellion that inspired the creation of a Catalan republic which lasted for a week. As I contemplated the unfolding of today’s Catalan separatist movement and the simultaneous rise of Scottish separatism, I thought it might be illuminating to attempt a sustained comparison of the historical experience of the two countries and of the ways in which a sense of national identity has manifested itself over the centuries.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Stop treating Catalonia as a proxy for ScotlandNaturally there are important differences between the two national histories, but differences can be as revealing as similarities in reaching historical conclusions. One obvious difference is that Scotland was for centuries an independent kingdom, whereas Catalonia was never a truly independent state. It was a principality that formed part of a federation, the Crown of Aragon, which was united with the Crown of Castile as a result of the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469. This dynastic union created the country that came to be known as ‘Spain’. Dynastic union between Scotland and England came more than a century later, when James VI of Scotland’s inheritance of the English throne in 1603 created ‘Great Britain’.  The immediate effect of these unions was similar, in the sense that, although both Scotland and Catalonia preserved their traditional forms of government, they were now linked to a far more powerful neighbour. This produced inevitable tensions, and at the start of the 18th century attempts were made to resolve them, although in very different ways. The 1707 Anglo-Scottish Union created a British parliamentary monarchy, in which the Scots surrendered their Edinburgh parliament in exchange for access to England’s expanding commercial and colonial empire.             In 1716, following the surrender of Barcelona two years earlier to the forces of Philip V, who was the monarch of the newly enthroned Bourbon dynasty, Catalonia, like the rest of the Crown of Aragon, was stripped of its traditional laws and liberties, and was merged into what became an authoritarian monarchical Spain.Scotland and Catalonia both benefited economically from the constitutional changes of the early 18th century, although the expansion of Britain’s overseas empire gave the Scots many more opportunities than those enjoyed by the Catalans. The British empire of the 18th and 19th centuries was a joint Anglo-Scottish creation, whereas the Catalans remained on the margins of Spain’s long-established American empire. Instead, they turned their energies to economic development, and became the pioneers of Spanish industrialisation, based on a rapidly growing textile industry. READ MORE: Brian Wilson: Catalonia is evidence of the benefits of a UnionScotland, too, was being transformed by the growth of its industries in the same period, but, unlike Catalonia, it never became the main power-house of the wider, national, economy. The long-term effect of these differences is still to be seen. In Spain, economic and political development were out of kilter in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While Madrid was the country’s political capital, its economic capital was Barcelona. In Britain, London was both.            In the 19th century, Catalonia’s relationship with the government in Madrid soured. This was partly the result of Spain’s chronic political instability in the decades following the Napoleonic invasion and the Peninsular War. But it can also be explained by a pan-European phenomenon, the emergence of a new-style nationalism inspired by the Romantic Movement. The researches of historians, literary scholars and folklorists into the origins of their societies generated a sense of the nation as an organic community with its own distinctive characteristics. Such explorations of the Catalan past helped produce another significant difference between Scotland and Catalonia. It was language that became the point of reference for national identity in Catalonia, in a way that Gaelic would never be for that of Scotland. The Catalans clung to their language when the repressive regime of General Franco sought to replace it with Castilian, the predominant language of Spain. After Franco’s death in 1975, a reaction was inevitable. The autonomous Catalan regime created by the 1978 Constitution of the newly democratic Spain was determined, through its control of the educational system, to ‘Catalanise’ Catalan society in the face of the encroachment of Castilian through the national media. The resulting linguistic question has played a large part in creating the current impasse between Catalonia and the Spanish government.It is one of the ironies of this stand-off that the 30 years between 1978 and the financial collapse of 2008 have been the most prosperous and successful in Catalonia’s colourful history. But the economic crisis gave radical Catalan nationalists a chance to depict Catalonia as the victim of a malign Spanish state, and the inflexibility of a Spanish government determined to treat the secessionist movement as a constitutional question that should properly be left to the courts handed the separatists a propaganda victory that they have exploited to the full. Referendums, whether authorised or unauthorised, as in the Catalan case, are at best blunt instruments for determining the will of the people. In forcing binary choices they can be deeply divisive, and Catalonia is now a bitterly divided society, in which intimidation is being exercised by secessionists who claim to speak for all its inhabitants. A highly creative people with a long and distinguished history, the Catalans deserve better than this.

Mike Russell, the Constitutional Relations Secretary in Nicola Sturgeon’s cabinet, said that people “require” such a ballot.

He told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme that this was the “issue that is going to haunt them”.Pressed on whether there should be a second European referendum, he stated: “I’ve been very sympathetic to that, the only caveat I’ve expressed, and it needs to be resolved, is what happens if that vote were to repeat what happened two years ago - Scotland to vote to stay and the rest of the UK to vote to leave.READ MORE: Scotland Office fights plan to strike down devolved Brexit legislation “We couldn’t do that twice.

They are not being helped by certainly the most incompetent UK government I have ever seen.“So there needs to be a clear choice. If the choice is Brexit Britain in this chaos and mess or independent membership of the EU, that would be a real choice.”The Liberal Democrats, who have been campaigning for a second Brexit vote, welcomed Mr Russell’s remarks.Scottish Lib Dem Europe spokesman Tavish Scott said: “It appears the SNP are finally starting to see the light. Mike Russell is right that the British people deserve to have the final say on whether Theresa May’s ropey Brexit deal is good enough.            “He does, however, need to give up on the constant caveats. This isn’t about political posturing.

The proposals, agreed after Theresa May summoned senior ministers to decide on plans for the future relationship with Brussels, will see the UK agree to remain in line with the EU on rules for all goods.            But under the Government’s plans the UK would be free to diverge from EU rules over services, a major part of the British economy, with ministers acknowledging this will reduce the levels of access available to European markets.            Brussels will be reluctant to consider any plan which would risk splitting the single market, and ministers appeared to acknowledge this by agreeing to step up preparations for a “no deal” Brexit.But Mrs May said she hoped the proposals would enable talks with the EU to move forward.Going into Chequers the Cabinet was split, with Brexit Secretary David Davis understood to have major reservations about both the plan and whether Brussels would even consider it seriously.But it is understood that all members of the Cabinet have signed up to the proposals and none of them have decided to quit rather than back the plan.The “common rulebook” for goods could reduce the UK’s flexibility to strike trade deals with other countries, particularly the US which would want an agreement allowing its farm products, produced to different standards, into the British market.            It would also involve the UK paying “due regard” to European Court of Justice rulings relating to the rules Britain will share with Brussels, potentially softening the Prime Minister’s red line on the jurisdiction of judges in Luxembourg.But the Prime Minister said the Cabinet had agreed a “collective position” on the future of the negotiations with the EU.“Our proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products,” she said.“This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.            “As a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.“We have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world. “Elements of the plan, which will be formally presented in a White Paper next week, were revealed in a three-page summary.They include:- The UK committing to “ongoing harmonisation” with EU rules on goods to ensure frictionless trade at ports and the border with Ireland            - A “joint institutional framework” would provide for the consistent interpretation and application of UK-EU agreements, with British courts ruling on cases in Britain and EU courts in the EU but a joint committee and independent arbitration settling disputes- A new “facilitated customs arrangement” would remove the need for checks and controls by treating the UK and EU as if they were a “combined customs territory”- The UK would effectively impose EU tariffs at the border for goods intended for the bloc but would “control its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world”- Free movement of people will end, but a “mobility framework” will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other’s territories and apply to study or workMrs May said: “Next week we will be publishing a White Paper which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.“Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.”Ahead of the formal announcement of the deal, Tory Brexiteers warned that Mrs May’s position could be under threat if she watered down her red lines.Leading Brexiteer David Jones, a former minister at Mr Davis’s Department for Exiting the EU, said the proposed deal breached all three of Mrs May’s red lines of leaving the single market, customs union and jurisdiction of the ECJ.Describing the plan as “not very good at all”, Mr Jones told BBC Radio 4’s Today that it would deliver “something less than the full Brexit we have had repeated promises of by the PM and Cabinet members”.Andrea Jenkyns, who quite as a ministerial aide in order to speak more freely about Brexit, said she would be willing to help trigger a leadership contest if the deal left the UK “one foot in, one foot out” of the EU.“I am not a hypocrite,” the Morley and Outwood MP said in an interview recorded for the BBC’s Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.“I am standing up for the 17.4 million people who wanted these red lines and who wanted to ensure we did not have a half in-half out Brexit.”And Stewart Jackson, a former MP now the senior aide to the Brexit Secretary, tweeted a link to a story about a poll warning that “Tories will lose votes if they cross Brexit red lines”.The entire Cabinet, including ministers who are not full members but attend meetings, arrived one by one by car at Chequers on Friday morning in time for discussions to start at 10am.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: “It is farcical that it has taken two years for the Cabinet to even attempt to agree a position on the basics of our future relationship with the EU.“On previous form, whatever has apparently been agreed will struggle to survive contact with Tory MPs and members.“This looks like a sticking plaster rather than the Government’s final position.“With just a matter of months of the negotiations left, Theresa May’s ability to deliver Brexit continues to be in doubt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tired old games jamie halcro johnston ","story":"Regrettably, Humza Yousaf has once again chosen to play politics and attack MSPs who have stood up for the interests of Orkney and Shetland at Holyrood while he and his SNP colleagues were trying for months to pretend that their long-standing commitment to fair funding did not exist.\nThere is little doubt that, without this issue being raised up the political agenda, the SNP would have dropped their pledge to the people of the islands like a stone. So it is a shame that Mr Yousaf continues to play the same tired old games, even after the commendable efforts of councillors and MSPs of all parties and none has secured at least some action towards correcting this patently unfair situation.\nThe transport minister is right in congratulating the island councils for their tenacity in pursuing this issue. It\u0026#8217s just a shame it was the actions – or inactions – of his SNP government which forced them to be so tenacious.\nAnd what is now abundantly clear is that, in spite of the SNP\u0026#8217s protests, the money was always available to address this issue. The SNP managed to magic up an extra £170 million yesterday which, apparently, they didn\u0026#8217t have when the budget was first presented. So the question many in the Northern Isles should be asking Mr Yousaf is why didn\u0026#8217t the SNP include fair funding in their draft budget in the first place?\nWhen SNP ministers were trying to dismiss fair funding, I was regularly questioning them in the Scottish Parliament on their commitment. I was meeting with representatives from the island councils – in Lerwick, in Kirkwall and in Edinburgh.\nI put forward the amendment which, accepted by the entire Scottish Parliament (including Mr Yousaf and the SNP), recognised the lifeline nature of our internal ferries. And I wrote to Mr Yousaf and to his boss, Nicola Sturgeon, on the issue.\nSo I suppose it is flattering that, of all the opposition MSPs who voted against the SNP Budget, Mr Yousaf has chosen to single me out in this way for his faux outrage. I would suggest it\u0026#8217s an indication of the effectiveness of my consistent and vocal opposition to the SNP\u0026#8217s attempt to sweep its own fair funding pledge under the carpet.\nAnd in relation to the vote itself, Mr Yousaf seems intent on misleading Shetlanders. The truth is that MSPs do not vote on individual parts of the budget, but rather on the budget as a whole.\nSo, even with the late U-turn on additional ferry funding, this budget remains, overall, a disappointing budget for people and businesses in Shetland. It will mean that many of my constituents – in fact, anyone earning over £26,000 per year – will pay more tax.\nIt will hit the incomes of local people and businesses, something numerous business organisations have warned will harm Scotland\u0026#8217s already sluggish economic growth. And it leaves our local councils across the region still having to make tough spending decisions. So it is for those local and regional MSPs who supported the SNP\u0026#8217s budget to defend their decision. I simply wasn\u0026#8217t prepared to back a budget which will leave too many local people out of pocket.\nAnd an inconvenient fact Mr Yousaf, too busy patting himself on the back for belatedly delivering something even the SNP in Orkney accept was always an SNP commitment, choses to ignore is that this is only a deal for this year and not a long term solution. So the real risk is that we will have to go through this process all over again for next year\u0026#8217s budget.\nI hope next year, the SNP will deliver a long term settlement on fair funding, not another one off. That a long-term solution will be found that will meet the needs of the local communities so reliant on these lifeline links. And that Mr Yousaf, Derek Mackay and the SNP will avoid the political theatrics that have dominated this year\u0026#8217s budget process.\n Edinburgh.\n If all politicians behaved in this manner it is likely that every budget in every parliament would fail, even though every single clause had enthusiastic and popular local backing no one was willing to support the package as a whole.\n Clearly these are not the section of his constituents Mr Halcro \u0026#8211 Johnston is interested in.\n The tartan Tories are living up to their name for sure and their blind supporters still try to defend them.\nMr Halcrow objects to political parties playing games?\n\nWhich party does Christopher \u0026#8216up-skirting\u0026#8217 Chope belong to again?\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch.

It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

I very much welcome this increase in school clothing grant as it helps to reduce inequalities for Highland families and is one of the measures being taken to proactively address poverty, and in particular child poverty.\"\nApplications are now being invited for the academic year starting in August 2018. To streamline the application process, the council has a single application form for school clothing grants and free school meals. They are available from the operations team on 01463 703645.\nHelp with completing the form is also available from the welfare support team: Freephone 0800 090 1004.\nPictured: Councillors MacKinnon

the eye of storm in Tornado Alley","story":"Nicole Webber\n\u0026nbsp\nA storm chaser from Newtonmore had to run for cover from some of the world\u0027s most extreme weather in Tornado Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nSaturday 7 Jul 2018 4:39
