The makeup artist had to strategically apply the bubbles’People think of the Bros brothers as very serious and into themselves, but I’ve known them from the start and they’ve always been up for a bit of a laugh. This picture of Luke was taken for Cosmopolitan towards the end of the 1990s. The magazine had done a famous portrait of Burt Reynolds on a bearskin rug in 1972 and I wanted this shoot with Luke to resurrect the idea of the male pin-up. It was something I’d already had experience of because I’d done a couple of calendars called the Blues Boys in the mid-80s – it was a company run by women who were sick of all the male-orientated pin-up calendars that were on the walls of garages.I initially shot Luke smoking a cigar, with just a towel hiding the crown jewels, and that shot was what ended up going in the magazine. But I wanted to try out something more jokey too, so I hired a roll-top bath and got Luke in it. We tried filling it with water but the plug didn’t work properly. The studio was on the top floor of a block in Islington and the water dripped through into the office below – they came up to complain only to find a naked pop star in a bath.I always like photos that make you smile. I used to carry a bag of props around with me just to make photos more interesting – I’ve shot Toyah wearing rabbit ears, Ian McCulloch with a bunch of carrots and Robert Smith up a tree.The band had broken up by the time of this picture and Luke was embarking on his acting career. He had no problem getting completely naked – although his missus was there, keeping an eye on him. The makeup artist had to strategically apply the bubbles. She didn’t mind. In fact, I think she quite enjoyed her day!I remember taking some Polaroids to show Luke and he said: “Oh my God, I look like I’ve got a body.” He actually had a good upper body but very skinny legs. That’s why I turned him sideways and hid them in the bath.I had a good relationship with both Matt and Luke. They were ordinary teenage kids when I first met them, although as they got bigger they became a bit more precious and their timekeeping definitely got worse. They’d turn up four hours late and we’d have to then work until 3am. I watched the recent Bros documentary, which shocked me. At the beginning, when Matt was in his Las Vegas apartment talking about crystals, I thought: “My God, what’s happened to him?” But by the end I recognised them as the same people – especially their need to always break off and discuss things intensely.I’d actually forgotten about taking this picture. I only printed it recently when I was looking for pop-star images for a new book. It makes me smile because he’s really going for it. I guess he had to – otherwise the whole thing might have looked a bit pathetic!Training: None. I taught myself to take pictures, develop film and print as a hobby while looking for work after university. Luckily, my hobby became my job.Influences: When I first started it was the work of the Hollywood portrait photographers, such as George Hurrell and Angus McBean, as I loved their lighting.

He discusses how her work changed his life‘I always used to joke that I ruined Linda’s career,” says Paul McCartney, sitting on a sofa in his office in Soho, London, with a selection of his late wife’s photographs spread on the table before him. “She became known as ‘Paul’s wife’, instead of the focus being on her photography. But, as time went on, people started to realise that she was the real thing. So, yeah, she eventually did get the correct reputation, but at first it was just blown out of the water by the headline-grabbing marriage.”He has a point. Before she met and married him, in March 1969, Linda Eastman was an award-winning photographer. Born in 1941 and raised in a suburb of New York, she had studied under Hazel Archer – who taught the artist Robert Rauschenberg, among others – and was the first woman to shoot a Rolling Stone cover, featuring Eric Clapton. Her speciality was capturing pop stars in unguarded moments: a tearful Aretha Franklin Jimi Hendrix mid-yawn Janis Joplin backstage, her bottle of Southern Comfort already drained. But marriage to a Beatle tended to overshadow your own work and reputation, as Yoko Ono discovered.It wasn’t until years later that her talent was reappraised: 1976’s unassumingly titled book Linda’s Pictures was the first in a series of collections of her work. If anything, her reputation has grown since her death in 1998 – The Linda McCartney Retrospective, at Kelvingrove Art Gallery in Glasgow, is just the latest global exhibition of her work. It was curated by McCartney, along with their daughters, Mary and Stella here, he picks six of his favourite photographs. “As you can probably tell,” he says, after an exhaustive account of one of the McCartneys’ family holidays in Orkney in the early 70s, “I like talking about this stuff.”“She was a great believer in the happy accident. Where other people might have said: ‘Well, this is blurred, we can’t use this one, we’ll go and look for the sharper photographs,’ she went with it. I love this picture – his guitar looks like an instrument from the future, a space-age thing. It just looks to me like his music sounds: exciting blues. A friend of ours, Brian Clarke, made a stained-glass window of this image, which is fabulous: I’ve got it in my studio.”“Linda put you at your ease. Some photographers, you’re very aware that you’re having a picture taken. But she had such a relaxed attitude that she’d get a picture of Jimi Hendrix, but he’d be yawning in it. He felt comfortable enough to yawn, she felt confident enough to take a picture of him yawning, knowing he wouldn’t mind.”“This is me and John, in Abbey Road. It wasn’t too long before the breakup of the Beatles this would be the end of our relationship and, at the end, when the breakup happened, it was kind of sour – very difficult to deal with. The rumour started going around that John and I didn’t get on well, we were arch-rivals, that it was very heavy and ugly. The strange thing is you sometimes get to believe something, if it’s said enough times. So I used to think: ‘Yeah, it’s a pity, you know, we didn’t get on that well.’“So this picture is a blessing for me. It’s like, this is how we were: this is why we related, or else we couldn’t have collaborated for all that time. It sums up what our relationship was like the minute we were actually working on a song, and most of the time we were together, really. I’m just writing something out – possibly it’s a medley or something it might be for Abbey Road – and it’s lovely, because John is very happily in on the process, and agreeing with me, and we’re laughing about something. Just seeing the joy between us here really helped me, because it reminds me that the idea we weren’t friends is rubbish. We were lifelong friends, our relationship was super-special.“That applied to all the Beatles, even when we were pissed off with each other from time to time. People used to remind me: that’s families, that happens. Mates disagree. As soon as we started working on music, we gelled, we just enjoyed the noise we made together, we enjoyed playing with each other. We’d worked together for over 10,000 hours over the years, and that old spirit automatically kicked in. Any disputes were got over very quickly.”“This was taken in London in 1978. I love it because it’s a historic piece, because the cars and everything date it, but it’s also a really good portrait of me.“Technically, I still don’t get this one, because there’s me in the rear-view mirror and I’m in focus, but the houses are in focus and the bus is in focus as well. So I don’t get how that worked. It’s not a montage, it’s a straight photo. And the other thing is that I’m driving, and I think Linda is taking the picture with one of our babies on her lap – if you look, there’s a very faint reflection in the windscreen. Talk about multi-tasking.“One of the things about Linda, when you talk about how people seem at ease in her photos, is that it was her lifestyle. We’d say: ‘Let’s go out of London,’ so I’d just drive, we’d get out of London and I’d say: ‘Where do you want to go?’ She’d say: ‘Just anywhere.’ After a while, you’d end up in areas you didn’t know, going: ‘Ooh, I’m getting a bit lost here,’ and she’d say: ‘Great.’ You were in places you’d never been, you were seeing things you hadn’t intended to see, all of which was rich stuff for her photography. I remember I wrote the song Two of Us about that – ‘Two of us riding nowhere  Spending someone’s hard-earned pay.’ That was one of those excursions, when we were first going out together, this great idea of getting lost. Until I met Linda, I panicked when I got lost, you know?”“One day, we were just on the beach, having a swim, but she’s seen this mother and child, and it’s an interesting moment, so she’s just grabbed her camera and snapped it. She wouldn’t have used a whole reel on it it could even be the only shot. Because she’d had to do things quickly, she’d just worked on the hoof, without an assistant. She didn’t use light meters often – she guessed – so she just went out with a pocket stuffed with film, camera around her neck and that would be it. There’s something fascinating about this moment she’s caught, the way the kid is looking into the camera eerily, the mum with this incredible bathing hat on. I could look at it for hours.”“This was at the airport in Los Angeles. I had to do something record-related – I think it was a convention that Capitol, our American record label, were having – and she happened to be in LA, so she could hang out with me. She’d turn up at the hotel and we’d say: ‘Oh, what are we going to do today? Shall we do something? Well, let’s just stay in,’ and we’d just do nothing, basically. We loved that freedom. It was an important thing in a relationship, that neither of us minded doing nothing much.The Linda McCartney Retrospective is at Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow, from 5 July to 12 January 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83eca1f9df2d045af6a2841ed1bdd39f48a6ba49/0_16_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b82e9717645d23b27d5ce7317f391d97","title":"earth photo 2019 shortlisted artists royal geographical society","story":"Contenders for prizes in the competition developed jointly by Forestry England and the Royal Geographical Society.

Meet the master calligrapher keeping the script aliveAnyone who has ever fired off a text in haste will sympathise with the first point on 11th-century Japanese writer Sei Shōnagon’s list of “infuriating things”: “Thinking of one or two changes in the wording after you’ve sent off a reply to someone’s message.”This list, her messages, and her Pillow Book in which they’re recorded – a sparklingly acerbic, blog-style frolic through the lives of Heian-era aristocrats – were written using kana, a Japanese script mainly used by women for nearly a millennium to write literature, arrange secret assignations and express themselves freely within the confines of court life.“Reading my grandmother’s letters was always difficult for me as a teenage girl,” recalls Akagawa. “Her handwriting looked like scribbling, and I used to ask her to write properly.” But years later, during Akagawa’s calligraphy training, she had a revelation while taking a journey along Himekaido, a historic trading route favoured by women travellers. Reading documents written in kana housed in castles and temples, Akagawa says: “I felt as if I were reading a history of my DNA.” Far from being scribbles, she realised, her grandmother had been writing to her using the same script.Akagawa uses the forgotten kana in a style of calligraphy called kana shodo, and also fuses traditional calligraphy with new techniques in a style she’s named kana art, where thousands of minutely painted kana form larger images and paper sculptures.“When people talk about Japanese calligraphy, they normally mean kanji shodo,” Akagawa explains, “a style imported from China, practiced by samurais and monks.” Kana shodo uses a script which was known by the 10th century as onnade, or “woman hand”, she continues, which became “the backbone of a female-dominated literary culture”.Sei Shōnagon’s contemporary Murasaki Shikibu wrote her masterpiece The Tale of Genji – often called the world’s first novel – using kana, which were often associated with private and emotional life. Men who wanted to reply to love letters sent by noblewomen used kana themselves to reply. And the tradition lasted for hundreds of years the 19th-century novelist Ichiyō Higuchi used kana script for her sympathetic portrait of the life of a geisha, Nigorie (Troubled Waters).Japan’s government standardised writing in 1900, establishing the system of kanji, hiragana and katakana characters used side-by-side in modern written Japanese. Only 50 of more than 550 kana characters were retained, creating the gojūon (“fifty sounds”) syllabaries used today. By the second world war, knowledge of the older kana had almost vanished. One of the last generation to use the script in daily life was Akagawa’s grandmother, born in 1921: “When I told her I was learning kana shodo, she was very pleased.”Women have developed writing systems for their own use all over the world, partly because they have been excluded from education systems designed for men. Perhaps the most extraordinary example is nüshu, a code-like script understood only by women from Jiangyong county in China’s Hunan province, used to record autobiographies, songs, letters and embroidered poems. While the last woman to learn nüshu traditionally, Yang Huanyi, died in 2004, efforts by Hunan women and Tsinghua University professor Zhao Liming have resulted in drives to preserve it.Whether writing Japanese classics, love letters or embroidered messages, women have circumvented official communication channels in creative ways throughout history. As Akagawa remarks, such handwritten texts frequently feel very personal: “I’m always surprised how such a simple action as handwriting can affect audiences’ emotions so deeply.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dacd3cfdfd0507c6c6d2c7b43c5c071e509b3df1/0_196_5158_3095/master/5158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a4b716f5612026488f1b2ade0c28005","title":"suzanne moore of the guardian wins orwell prize for journalism","story":"Articles on Brexit and #MeToo aftermath make columnist joint winner with Steve Bloomfield of Prospect columnist Suzanne Moore has won the Orwell prize for journalism for her “stubborn and brave commentary” on the aftermath of Brexit, #metoo and the politics of remembrance.Moore won the prize for articles on attitudes to Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky in the wake of the #MeToo movement why she was wrong to refuse to wear a poppy for remembrance and why she did not take part in the march for a People’s Vote.The prize is awarded for commentary or reporting which comes closest to the writer George Orwell’s ambition to “make political writing into an art”.The judges were Tim Marshall, a former diplomatic editor at Sky, Sam Taylor, editor of the Lady magazine, and Vaughan Smith, the founder of the Frontline Club.Moore was awarded the journalism prize jointly with the deputy editor of Prospect magazine, Steve Bloomfield, at a ceremony at Jeffery Hall in central London on Tuesday.The judges said: “The journalism that has won these two prizes represents the best of the Orwell tradition, incisive, relevant and human. It also represents the two sides of his journalism: there is Suzanne Moore’s stubborn and brave commentary, and Steve Bloomfield’s forensic research and reporting.”In their acceptance speeches both Moore and Bloomfield lamented the lack of ersity in the media.After the ceremony Moore said she planned to celebrate with the “biggest G and T you have ever seen”.Last year’s winner was the Observer’s Carole Cadwalladr for her investigation of the collapsed political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Cadwalladr gave a presentation at Tuesday night’s ceremony on the legacy of Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, which was published 70 years ago this month.The prize is awarded by the Orwell Foundation with the support of Orwell’s family.Moore was presented with a folio edition of Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, signed by Richard Blair, George Orwell’s son. She also picked up a cheque for £3,000.Two books about the Troubles in Northern Ireland were announced as winners of the Orwell prize for political writing and political fiction.Anna Burns’s experimental novel Milkman won the inaugural prize for political fiction, while the prize for political writing was awarded to Patrick Radden Keefe for his book Say Nothing.The Orwell prize for exposing Britain’s social evils went to Max Daly for his investigations for Vice linking missing children to county lines drug selling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55a79328abdef90c1539d12346f4f7ffb633a6be/0_127_3464_2078/master/3464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3686edaff9595b7f4b577c489783cc0","title":"top 10 books about the river thames","story":"From bucolic source to marshy lower reaches, London’s mighty river has inspired great writingThe Thames is 215 miles from source to sea, and for centuries writers of all kinds have been inspired by it, returning to its banks again and again to explore what it can tell us about memory, history and landscape. It’s one of the most written-about parts of Britain – there’s something irresistible about the river that makes it a perfect background to all kinds of storytelling.My introduction to this wealth of river writing began at the end: I grew up sailing on the Thames estuary – the muddy, sometimes smelly, coastal area downstream from London where the famous river finally joins the North Sea. My parents arrived here after sailing thousands of miles from South Africa in a boat they had built themselves. By the time I was born a few years later, the estuary had ceased to be just a point of entry for them. It was home.When I began work on my book about this area, The Way to the Sea, I discovered the estuary hasn’t always been a popular subject for those writing about the river – it inspired only a fraction of the thousands of titles about the Thames with something to say about the places I know. In my own writing, I’ve always tried to think about the Thames as one long, living piece of landscape, with no one part missed out, and for that reason I gravitate towards books that do the same. Here are 10 of the best:1. Thames: Sacred River by Peter AckroydThe nearest thing there is to a comprehensive modern biography of the river, packed with fascinating titbits about its literary, artistic and religious connections down the ages. It’s particularly good on the upper reaches of the Thames before it gets to London, where medieval monasteries used to stand at every bend and pilgrims would pass by on their way to the great shrine at Canterbury.2. Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K JeromeThis comic novel from 1889 is a classic for a reason. It captured the moment when commercial shipping traffic vanished on the upper Thames and it became a place for leisure, where Jerome, his two friends and their dog Montmorency could splash about and submerge the stresses of London life in the glories of the river. Such was this book’s runaway popularity that Jerome’s publisher once commented: “I cannot imagine what becomes of all the copies of that book I issue. I often think the public must eat them.”3. The True Heart by Sylvia Townsend WarnerA deceptively simple love story I could reread endlessly. It was first published in 1929, but is set in 1873 out on the Essex marshes, where the Thames merges with the sea. Sukey Bond is a lowly orphan, in service on a remote farm where she meets and falls in love with Eric Seaborn, a simple lad known as a “holy fool”. When they are forcibly parted, Sukey heads upriver to seek out Queen Victoria, who she feels is the one person who will understand their plight.4. The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth GrahameThis one needs no introduction – the charms of “messing about in boats” with Ratty and Mole are very well known indeed. But it wasn’t until I started researching my own book that I realised how much it has to say about the river and the 19th-century expansion of London that changed the surrounding countryside forever. I also love Grahame’s image of the Thames as “a babbling procession of the best stories in the world”. That’s how I like to think of it, too.5. The House by the Thames by Gillian TindallThis biography of a single house that sits just by the south side of the Millennium Bridge is fascinating for what it shows about the transition of inner London from dirty and crime-ridden to expensive, glassed-in corporate playground. I particularly like how famous people such as Christopher Wren and Catherine of Aragon are just background characters in this book – the real star is the house and all that it represents about the river and the city.6. Great Expectations by Charles DickensThe Hoo peninsula, a spur of land between the Thames and its final tributary the Medway, is not a place that has appeared much in classic fiction. But it’s in a graveyard near the Hoo’s highest point that young Pip meets the convict Magwitch, who has just escaped from a prison hulk and is fleeing his jailers through the Thames marshes. I first read this scene as a teenager and I still find it chilling. Pip is terrified, but little knows that this chance meeting will change the course of his life.7. Downstream: A History and Celebration of Swimming the River Thames by Caitlin DaviesThis book is a delightful compendium of watery facts and documents the changing physical relationship we have with the river. Swimming in the Thames has been a popular pastime for centuries, despite its often murky and polluted waters. Organised races have been going on that long, too – in 1791 the winner of an eight-guinea wager swim from Westminster Bridge to London Bridge “expired” after celebrating too hard on the gin, and in 1880 a dog named Now Then beat a man in a 10-mile swim upriver from the Isle of Sheppey.8. The Mirror of the Sea by Joseph ConradBefore he was a novelist, Conrad spent nearly two decades in the merchant navy, and after retiring he published this selection of autobiographical essays about his time on the high seas. I love it for his accounts of sailing in and out of the Thames in the late 19th century, and for his descriptions of riverside life in London, where smaller wharves were still in use alongside the big docks in east London. The ships in the centre of the city looked like “a flock of swans kept in the flooded backyard of grim tenement houses”, he wrote.9. News from Nowhere by William MorrisI’ve read this strange story so many times and I still can’t decide what it is: my best approximation is part science fiction, part utopian treatise, part romance of the river. Its protagonist, William Guest, falls asleep in the late 19th century and wakes in the future. He finds that a revolution has occurred and society has been refashioned along communist lines. He rows up the Thames with a group of comrades to see this new world, a journey that mirrors one the Morris family took between their two Thames-side residences, one in London at Hammersmith and one at Kelmscott in Gloucestershire.10. Wide Open by Nicola BarkerThis novel from 1998 is precious to me because it’s set on the Isle of Sheppey in the Thames estuary, and accurately represents it as the very peculiar place I knew as a child. Barker fills this marshy island with drifters and eccentrics, characters who find themselves out of place and dislocated from the “real life” upriver. Her writing is full of surprises, from nudists to wild boars to unexploded bombs, but the landscape of the river’s edge is a constant presence.• The Way to the Sea: The Forgotten Histories of the Thames Estuary by Caroline Crampton is published by Granta Books.

Increased stimulus can help the stock market to rise, as companies’ borrowing costs are cut. Investors have also become more positive about the chances of a resolution in the US-China trade dispute, after a prolonged period of concern over the standoff between Washington and Beijing. Although rate cuts from the US Fed could suggest a weakening economy, the prospect of stimulus from the US central bank has also lifted markets.After ballooning as companies rushed to import goods to avoid Brexit disruption, the UK’s trade deficit – the shortfall between imports and exports – narrowed to £2.7bn in April from £6.1bn in March. Although suggesting that import and export volumes may be returning to normal, economists said the latest figures could indicate that firms in both the UK and on the continent now have unusually high levels of inventory, meaning they do not need to trade as much as would normally be the case. Export demand has also suffered in recent months amid a broader slowdown in the global economy due to the US-China trade dispute.Surveys of business activity used as early warning signals for the British economy by the Bank of England and the Treasury suggested that UK economic growth remained weak last month. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply showed that service sector activity, which accounts for four-fifths of the economy, strengthened in May, despite manufacturing and construction slumping into contraction amid heightened levels of uncertainty over Brexit. The IHS MarkitCips services purchasing managers rose to a three-month high of 51 from 50.4 in April, following a rise in domestic orders. A figure above 50 indicates growth. Still, economists warned the pattern of growth remained close to stalling point.Falling corporation tax receipts damaged the health of the public finances in May, which in turn fueled a rise in government borrowing. Public sector net borrowing widened to £5.1bn, about £1bn more than May 2018 and £1bn more than forecast by City economists. It comes as tax and spending decisions are likely to be given to a new chancellor after the Conservative leadership race. Philip Hammond, widely expected to be replaced, has advised the next prime minister to be prudent as Brexit could damage the health of the public finances. However, most of the hopefuls vying to replace Theresa May promised tax cuts and spending increases.The Brexit uncertainty serving as a brake on the housing market appeared to ease last month, as a survey of chartered surveyors showed that prices picked up on relief that the UK hadn’t crashed out of the EU without a deal this spring. A gauge of house prices from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors – which shows the difference between members reporting price rises and falls – improved to -10 from -22 in April. Although the strongest reading since October, analysts warned that concern over Brexit was still holding back some buyers and sellers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4293a404318da2bb323cbe3797eb684f427d49d1/231_759_2843_1706/master/2843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49bf971202b8ea8baca7c2eeb8d8d808","title":"uk council ikea affordable housing worthing boklok","story":"Worthing council gives go-ahead for 162 flats by retailer’s joint venture with construction firm SkanskaHomebuyers in a town where properties typically cost almost 12 times local salaries may soon have a low-cost option from Ikea after a UK council agreed to work with an affordable housing developer co-owned by the retailer.Worthing council has signed up with BoKlok, a company jointly owned by the Swedish retailer and construction firm Skanska which specialises in factory-built housing that can be constructed at a low cost.The firm sets property prices so that buyers have money left to live on after they have paid their housing costs, and its website says “a single parent can afford to buy and live in a newly built two-bedroom BoKlok apartment”.It has built 11,000 homes across Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway, and is keen to break into the UK after a false start more than a decade ago.Previous plans for a development in Tyneside were scaled back when the financial crisis hit, but its latest effort is a collaboration with Worthing council, which believes it can achieve more affordable homes through the deal than if it sells the land to a conventional developer.Councillors in the coastal town have voted to work on a plan that would see 162 flats built on land that it owns.The latest data from the Office for National Statistics showed that in 2018 average house prices in Worthing were 11.7 times average salaries, compared with a figure of 7.8 times across England and Wales.In a report, the council said that access to homes was challenging for those on the average salary, which was £25,458 in 2015 – with only one-bedroom properties within reach, it noted.Under the plans the council will license the developer to use the land rather than selling it off, charging it an annual ground rent.The council, which has more than 1,300 households on its housing waiting list, said its analysis suggested the land could be used for 45 homes with just 13 of them available for affordable rent.The company said it has “scrutinised our costs and trimmed them to the bone,” but there are no compromises on quality.Flooring and wall tiles are included in the price, and homes are fitted with an Ikea kitchen. Worthing council’s plans show-homes that range from one-bedroom apartments measuring 50 sq metres (538sq ft) to three-bedroom apartments of 74 sq metres (800sq ft).Councillor Kevin Jenkins, Worthing borough council’s executive member for regeneration, said: “In this current market it’s extremely tough for local people who are in full-time work to get on the housing market.“This proposal could change that, giving these hard-working iniduals a genuine chance to buy their own home without having to move out of the town.”If the plans go ahead work on the site will begin in September 2020, with the first homes would be delivered and assembled the following January, and ready to move into in April 2021.Further homes may follow, with the council and BoKlok agreeing a programme to provide 500 homes in the borough.The project is one of a range of ways councils are working with developers to create more affordable homes for local people. Croydon council has set up a company called Brick by Brick which is building homes for social rent subsidised by homes sold on the open market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0db76b28aaba323d64eff74ed91f2a177ff7ca30/0_2748_3413_2048/master/3413.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9a82b90e112a0fb73ec1d75f1f38f774","title":"people think were from another planet meet karachis female cyclists","story":"Teams of women and girls are among numerous cycle groups increasingly to be seen on the streets of the frenetic Pakistan megacityEarly on Sunday morning in Karachi, a group of girls are riding loops around an empty stretch of road outside the colonial-era Custom House. At 6am they left the narrow alleys of the old neighbourhood of Lyari, branded a war zone by national and international media after a lengthy and brutal gang conflict. Two hours later they are still happily pedalling away, in ballet slippers and with headscarves tucked under helmets.“I used to cycle alone,” says Gullu Badar, 15. “It’s nice to cycle here because there’s no danger, no cars. It feels good that there are other girls cycling with me too.”“Don’t you want to take a break?” asks Zulekha Dawood, their instructor from the Lyari Girls Cafe collective. “No,” they shout, and continue chasing each other around.It is rare to see women cycling in Pakistan but scenes like this are increasingly being played out across Karachi on weekend mornings. Numerous cycling groups take over the empty streets, such as the Critical Mass movement. Cycling initiatives have made their way to campuses such as the NED University of Engineering and Technology. There are also sponsored and themed bike rides, including ones to raise awareness of polio, to mark the start of mango season and to honour Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the country’s founder.As cycling becomes more popular, many people are returning to bikes for the first time since childhood. For Aliya Memon, 30, who climbed on a bike last September after a 15-year gap, the memory of how to ride immediately came back. “I started cycling again because it is an emotional outlet,” she says. “You release endorphins when you cycle. You have a sense of achievement.”But it can be difficult in a frenetic city of 15 million. As Karachi has grown from a fishing village to Pakistan’s first capital and now its economic hub, traffic and commute times have increased. Transportation options are dismal.On the city’s dilapidated buses, women squeeze into a cramped reserved section with only a few seats. Sexual harassment is rife onboard and at bus stops, and the limited service forces passengers to walk long distances. For women, the only other options are to share a rickshaw or taxi – an often expensive proposition – or depend on male relatives to drive them to work and school.Cycling could be one way for women to gain personal and economic freedom but it will be a long and bumpy road ahead – quite literally, given Karachi’s potholed streets. For most, cycling is just a recreational weekend activity, not a way to commute. Karachi has no bike paths or cycle parking, and the motor traffic is chaotic. The few cyclists on the roads are mostly daily-wage earners using basic bikes. While some people ride bikes to complete quick errands, the fear of being robbed deters many from cycling to work with a laptop, for example.Deciding there was safety in numbers, they trained indoors for seven months, learning from four women who already knew how to ride a bike. When they had a large enough group, they ventured out on the road.Habiba Allahdad, 39, a resident of Lyari, was hesitant at first, thinking her weight would be an obstacle. Now she hopes she can one day use a bike to run errands: “I want to show people in the neighbourhood that the girls who have this desire in their heart can look at me and do this too.”While there is safety in numbers, many cycling groups rely on support cars and mechanics. Women don’t ride alone on main roads. “When you’re on a bike, you feel a certain sense of freedom,” says Sadaf Furqan, 42, on a Saturday morning after completing a 25km ride with the Cycologists group. But cycling unaccompanied, she says, isn’t an option. “I long for the day I can take my bike and go out on my own but I have to bank on other people to ride. If I go on a long ride, there have to be at least five men in the group.”Nearly every woman interviewed recounts catcalls, stares and harassment. “People think we’ve come from some other planet,” Dawood says.“No matter how progressive people become, if someone is trying something new they cannot tolerate it,” Memon adds. “The ego of our men is very fragile.”Conservatives in Pakistan have been riled by female cyclists. In Peshawar, religious-political parties objected to a cycling rally for women organised by Zamung Jwandun (Our Youth), a local NGO. Wafa Wazir, the group’s 23-year-old founder, had been inspired by accounts of women who wanted to drive rickshaws or ride bikes. As opposition grew, however, Wazir was forced to put the plan on hold, citing the safety of participants.That hasn’t deterred the girls of Lyari, nor any of the women who’ve found cycling offers a release from the stresses of life in Karachi.“They want to scare girls so they don’t go out to cycle, and neither do others,” says Allahdad. “Because if girls ride a bicycle then they can also ride a motorcycle. I think it’s also jealousy at seeing girls getting ahead.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f856c708cbec61791a2fa2753cb2efffa92f2708/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81a2e0b74680df03e5ef8175378659a0","title":"brexit green policies vat solar batteries","story":"As pro-European MEPs we grow weary of the government claiming credit for European achievements while blaming Brussels for its own inaction or mismanagement. The capping of credit card charges is a sterling example. We battled for this in the European parliament while our government tried to block the move in the European council. Once passed, and finding that customers rather liked the idea of lower bills, ministers claimed the credit, suggesting that “rip-off charges have no place in a modern Britain”.Conversely, finger wagging at Brussels to deflect from British government failure is a well-rehearsed strategy. The latest blame game is about household solar batteries, which HMRC claims must be subject to the higher rate of VAT because of EU state aid rules. So let’s firmly hit the off switch on the misinformation being peddled on this issue and get to the truth of the matter.In January last year the EU commission published new proposals on VAT. A key aim of the revised rules was to close the loopholes that lead to large-scale VAT fraud. This costs the EU €50bn (£44.7bn) a year – that’s money that funds our schools, hospitals and more.The proposed new rules also offer more flexibility for countries to set rates and to extend VAT exemptions – including a zero rate and some reduced rates – but the proposals are being blocked because there is still no unanimous agreement between EU countries. The UK has been one of the countries showing a reluctance to push for reforms that could provide the flexibility to reduce or zero-rate VAT for energy efficiency measures.As unhelpful as the ECJ ruling was, there are a number of ways that the British government could have engaged constructively with it.First, it could have explored its breadth and almost certainly found that energy-saving materials used in home insulation do not include batteries.Second, it could have changed domestic legislation to defend energy efficiency as social policy – which would allow the reduced rate as the ECJ ruled. It is undisputable that reducing energy costs for poor households is a social good. Doing so would reduce the annual scandal of cold-weather deaths.Third, it could have influenced the current debate over the revision to the VAT regime and supported the Greens in demanding that all products that support the sustainability transition will be zero rated for VAT. But what can we expect of a government with totally different priorities? It continues to subsidise fossil fuels, backs fracking, wants to expand airports and build more roads, blocks onshore wind power and removes incentives for solar, and has continuously frozen the fuel tax escalator while it is forcing councils to cut subsidies to bus services and presides over the most expensive railway system in Europe.Meanwhile, as a thoroughly pro-European party, we Greens want to see an EU-wide Green New Deal that will place a social agenda at the heart of the fight against the climate emergency. This offers the prospect of a triple win: new and better jobs, improved welfare and reduced carbon emissions.It is hard to see how a Conservative government, gung-ho as it is for the hardest, most damaging version of Brexit, would ever engage constructively in the current debate in Europe over the revision of VAT rules. Far better for its Brexit narrative that the finger remains firmly pointed in the direction of Brussels.Brexit is casting its damaging shadow over important political policies and priorities. VAT on solar batteries is just one example. The government decided first to ignore the EU rules it was signed up to, then pick a fight with Brussels, then over-interpret the result of a legal case and use it to undermine support for the EU among the green lobby. In this sense it is a perfect example of how our national politics under the Tories has become subjugated to Brexit posturing while urgent environmental and social priorities are ignored.• Molly Scott Cato is Green MEP for South West England"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ecb9651e868258f08ae7687023348f5e57bb42/152_47_642_385/master/642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73040dc24013472ec4162ac025604abe","title":"arifa review sadia saeed shermin hassan","story":"Despite a strong central performance, the story of a British Asian woman’s everyday frustrations floats by with a weird lack of urgencyHere’s a homegrown debut that appears hellbent on snuffing out its own flickers of promise. Writer-director Sadia Saeed’s protagonist Arifa (Shermin Hassan) is a frustrated 28-year-old British Asian woman who works in insurance and lives at home with her parents. Scenes float by with a weird lack of urgency that doesn’t appear to be a conscious choice, jokes are muffled, and some of the performers fail to convince. The film can’t work as comedy, because the material isn’t up to snuff. As a character study, it struggles to wring much of note out of a heroine who may simply be too ordinary.The odd thing is that Saeed seems aware of this shortcoming, working in scenes in which Arifa’s fumbling attempts at creative writing are offered a no-nonsense critique by her tutor. One of the latter’s observations – “This isn’t a story it’s a magazine article” – reverberates loudly through the slice-of-life snapshots that follow, yet even a student-rag profile would demand more connective tissue than Saeed’s script provides. A naggingly unpersuasive strand involving Dad’s illegal tobacco smuggling operation generates less tension than the matter of which unworthy suitor our girl can shake off first. That quandary, in turn, becomes secondary to minor disputes in newsagents and aerobics classes.By far the film’s strongest suit is Hassan’s bright and likable performance, revealing an inner spark that makes the character less of a pushover than she initially seems. It may serve this performer well should she get her hands on more fortified, lived-in writing. A sparse piano score, by Level 42’s Mike Lindup, adds a note or two of atmosphere, and cinematographer Giuseppe Pignone collates some attractive glimpses of Soho at Christmas and out-of-season Brighton. Yet too often what’s going on registers as humdrum in the extreme. At the risk of sounding like that creative writing tutor, it’s the kind of drama you might experience walking past an open door."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4278344848a750af8849697b1773664c59810d2/689_519_3961_2376/master/3961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d10595c750d2a9dd134e1170615dbc9","title":"dal makhani recipe the perfect felicity cloake","story":"There’s dal, and then there’s dal makhani . Here’s how to make this gently spiced, luxuriant and defiantly rich Indian dishWhile dal, a general word for dried lentils, pulses and beans, as well as the infinite variety of cooked dishes they’re made into, is an everyday staple across the Indian subcontinent, dal makhani is, according to chef Maunika Gowardhan, “in a league of its own”. It’s saved, in the main, for weddings and other celebrations – and not only because the longer you cook it, the better it gets. It’s also unapologetically rich makhani means “buttery” in Hindi.Niki Segnit sums the spirit of the dish up perfectly in Lateral Cooking, when she describes it as “the dal equivalent of Joël Robuchon’s famously opulent puree de pomme de terre, except you don’t even have to pretend to want anything else to go with it”. Meera Sodha reckons it’s “one of the world’s finest dishes”, and all you need is a little patience, and a lot of ghee.They do indeed lend the finished dish a better colour, but neither my testers nor I think they add much else, so I’m going to leave them out. However, if you do happen to have some dried kidney beans lying around in need of using up (dried beans and pulses are best used within six months of purchase, according to Dutta the older they are the longer they will take to soften), by all means use them in place of some of the urad dal.I do like Gowardhan’s suggestion of roughly mashing the cooked dal in the absence of 40-odd hours to tend the dish, this is a useful shortcut for thickening the gravy.While Dutta, Gill, Sodha and Gowardhan cook their pulses separately, Singh and Will Bowlby, head chef at London’s Kricket, simmer them with onions, chillies and spices. I find this makes them difficult to skim, and gives the onion a rather slimy consistency, but the subtle, smoky sweetness that Anjali Pathak’s black cardamom and cinnamon gives the beans in her book Secrets from My Indian Family Kitchen, does appeal. If you don’t happen to have them, though, don’t worry – they’re by no means essential.This isn’t a dish that demands hundreds of different spices – indeed, Sodha uses just chilli powder – but warming garam masala, as used by Gill, Gowardhan and Dutta, works well with the richness of the cream, along with cumin for earthiness and coriander for zestiness – both popular ingredients in the recipes I try.The secret ingredient in Gill’s dal, which proves the runaway winner among my testers, is methi, or fenugreek leaves, which she tells me is a typical Punjabi ingredient. They add a haunting, smoky, almost musty flavour that takes me right back to India. Do try to find them, if you can Asian supermarkets will carry them, and they’re commonly stocked in the speciality ingredients or world food aisles of large supermarkets.Dutta’s recipe is unique in containing no onion or garlic, which are off limits to devout Hindus (hence the asafoetida, which is often used to impart a compensatory, savoury note in their place). Everyone else adds large amounts of the latter, along with ginger, and Gowardhan, Singh, Sodha, Bowlby and Pathak also start their dals with golden, slow-cooked onions, which gives them an answering sweetness to the beans and spices. I would suggest chopping, rather than slicing them, however the tangle of the former spoils the smoothness of the gravy for me.Fresh chillies are also common: finely chop them if you enjoy heat slit them and remove from the dal before serving if you’d prefer a milder result.Only Dutta leaves these out altogether the rest of the recipes are ided fairly evenly between fresh fruit and puree – we all prefer the latter, and not just because decent fresh tomatoes are so hard to come by in the UK for most of the year. The rich, deep, cooked flavour of the puree just works better with the earthy lentils and cream.“The reason I say this dish is for special occasions,” Gowardhan writes, “is the copious quantities of butter and cream. No recipe should skimp on it, and nor will mine!” Wise words: for my greedy crowd, Dutta’s yoghurt just won’t cut it. Sodha, interestingly, uses whole milk, simmering it down to sticky sweetness, and copious amounts of butter, but perhaps unsurprisingly, the double whammy of double cream and butter or ghee favoured by Bowlby, Singh and Gill proves the most popular. You can reduce the latter, if you like, but it seems a shame – there are thousands of great recipes for everyday dals out there (indeed, Dutta’s book is stuffed full of them), but this isn’t one of them.Prep 15 min, plus soaking timeCook 50 minServes 4-6 as a main or side200g urad dal, whole and unhulled1 cinnamon stick (optional)2 black cardamom pods (optional)5 tbsp ghee or butter2 large onions, peeled and finely chopped20g piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 green chillies, slit (or finely chopped, if you’d like your dal hotter)1 tsp garam masala1 tsp ground cumin1 tsp ground coriander½ tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder75g tomato puree150ml double cream2 tbsp dried fenugreek leavesFresh coriander (optional)Soak the dal overnight, then rinse well and drain. Cover with three times as much cold water and bring to a boil. Skim, then add the cinnamon stick and cardamom pods, if using. Simmer until the beans are soft enough to crush easily against the side of the pan, topping up the water if necessary, because they should always be covered (this will probably take 45 minutes to an hour).Meanwhile, melt four tablespoons of ghee in a large frying pan over a medium heat, then gently sweat the onions until soft and golden.Stir in the ginger, garlic and green chillies, cook for another minute or so, then stir in all the dried spices apart from the fenugreek leaves, and cook, stirring, for a few minutes more.Turn down the heat and stir in first the tomato puree and then, gradually, the cream and fenugreek. Turn off the heat.When the dal is ready, drain it over a bowl, retaining the water, then roughly mash so some of the dal is squashed and some remains whole. Stir all the dal into the pan with the sauce, then, over a low heat, add just enough of the cooking water to bring it to your desired consistency – I like mine quite thick, rather than soupy.Season to taste and serve with a scattering of fresh coriander, if you like the stuff.• Dal makhani: a heart attack in healthfood’s clothing, or the most delicious thing you can do with lentils?

He needs to put the players through their paces, wash some kit, pack another couple of strips into his VW transporter van, finish his academic work and then remember to settle the bill for the spaghetti bolognese he has pre-ordered for a party of 40 the next day. “I’ve received 14 phonecalls just since we’ve been chatting,” says Edwards, shaking his head and smiling at the madness of it all.Edwards is the former Swansea City, Nottingham Forest and Bristol Rovers defender in charge of Cardiff Met, who will become the first British University men’s side to play in European competition when they take on Progrès Niederkorn in Luxembourg on Thursday. The students beat Bala Town in the Welsh Premier League play-offs last month to take their place in the preliminary round of the Europa League, creating a little bit of history in the process and putting a fresh slant on the phrase “intelligent footballers”.“The squad used to be top heavy with undergraduates,” says Edwards. “These days we’re top heavy with PhDs and postgraduate students and then a small amount of undergraduate students, so for a footballing university team we’re very experienced. Some players are approaching 300 games for the team. And we’ve got varying backgrounds. Two of our players came from the professional game, one has captained Hereford at Wembley, and then you’ve got some boys who have never been at an academy in their lives – we’ve got five farmers from the west.”Their success is quite a story and, in fairness, one that should be framed around Edwards being described as much more than an ex-footballer, mindful of the fact that since retiring from the professional game in July 2006, the 43-year-old has gone on to gain a first-class honours degree at undergraduate level, a distinction in his masters and a PhD.Edwards certainly did not expect to return to football after hanging up his boots and enrolling as a student at Cardiff Met. He had been spending his spare time watching rugby when he answered a call for help. “The chief executive of the student union, Mike Davies, said they were going to pull the football programme because it was pointless, and asked if I fancied taking over,” recalls Edwards. “I wasn’t really interested in the football team and didn’t even know what level they played at. So I looked and we were at the bottom, the armpit of Welsh football. But they said they’d pay my masters fees, so it was a case of ‘Where do I sign?’”A decade on and as well as having “Dr” before his name – something that caused confusion with one former Forest teammate who wondered whether the Welshman was now in a position to sort out knee problems – Edwards has a total of five promotions on his CV, just about every coaching qualification going and is totally immersed in the role.A principled man who “doesn’t do egos”, Edwards put a rule in place from day one that anyone playing for the university has to be either a student or alumni. On top of that, he expects his team to deliver – and not just on the pitch. “If I find out they’re not in classes, they’re in trouble, they know that. But then the dressing room looks after that. No one would dare come in and say they had a 45 or a 50. Come in and say you got a 65 or a 70, yeah. That’s the work ethic the boys have. They’re embarrassed to get a poor mark.”It is tempting to wonder what their opponents in Luxembourg make of it all. Edwards is hoping that there may be a little bit of complacency. “I think they’ll be at the level of our champions, TNS. We played them on Friday, deliberately so for the mindset to be right. We know it’s going to be a hard test for us. But they may well underestimate students.”Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsWhatever the outcome over the two legs, Cardiff Met are guaranteed £193,000 in prize money for reaching this stage and although none of that will end up in the pockets of the staff or students involved, Edwards has been turning a few ideas over in his mind. “I think we need to sit down and look at how we can reward the players’ loyalty,” he says. “What that looks like, I don’t know. Maybe we get a holiday next year as a group.”Perhaps a trip to Las Vegas? “Maybe not Vegas,” says Edwards, looking a little taken aback at that suggestion. “Maybe the Mumbles.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49b399d55d21d278cfa559d61abf3a35d453b89d/0_127_3280_1968/master/3280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5960c11b42ceb1438ef78479c3a4d646","title":"manchester united sign aaron wan bissaka crystal palace transfer window footballl","story":"Manchester United are set to sign Aaron Wan-Bissaka for £45m from Crystal Palace, with the manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, adding a second signing who fits his desired profile of a young player with potential.The 21-year-old right-back is expected to join imminently in a deal that with add-ons may push the final price to around £50m. Solskjær has already added Daniel James, also 21, to his squad, the winger being bought from Swansea City for £15m earlier this month.Wan-Bissaka, like James, is pacy and has a rawness the manager hopes to mould as he bids to drive United forward next season. The right-back is yet to make 50 Premier League appearances and was in Aidy Boothroyd’s England Under-21 squad that failed to win a game at the European Championship currently underway in Italy.Solskjær is still thought to be targeting several positions including a centre-back – Harry Maguire is in the frame – a full-back, a midfielder and a striker. Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku both wish to depart and it may be the manager has to generate funds from the sales of the playmaker and forward – or others – before being able to add more than a third new signing this summer.Last season United finished in sixth place in the Premier League, 32 points behind the champions, Manchester City."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c257ce3e5f7bc853aa56f6ef779fd1b6bab3bbb/0_115_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1f3022004cee337cc2e613c38d7811e","title":"tottenham sign jack clarke leeds spurs medical ryan sessegnon","story":"Jack Clarke is on the verge of becoming Tottenham’s first signing of the summer in a deal from Leeds that could be worth £11.5m if all the add-ons are met. Spurs are ready to pay an initial fee of around £10m and the 18-year-old winger will undergo his medical on Wednesday.Clarke has just completed his breakthrough season, quickening the pulse on his first Championship start against Derby in January before his form tailed off after he collapsed in the dugout while watching the second half at Middlesbrough in February.Mauricio Pochettino is convinced that Clarke has what it takes to step up in the Premier League under his guidance, having seen enough over 22 Championship appearances – only four of which were from the start.Pochettino is looking to reinvigorate his squad by signing hungry, young players with the potential to improve and the move for Clarke is independent of the push for another teenage winger – Ryan Sessegnon of Fulham, who is rated in the £25m bracket.Spurs have an interest in Sessegnon’s twin brother, Steven, a right-back who is also at Fulham, and the 19-year-old Norwich player Max Aarons is another target in that position. Much will depend on whether Pochettino sells his first-choice right-back, Kieran Trippier, who is of interest to Napoli among others.Spurs have made a club-record bid of £55m for the Lyon midfielder Tanguy Ndombele and they are confident of getting the deal over the line, which would be a major coup. With funds tight owing to the cost of the stadium project, they could balance the books by selling Christian Eriksen. The playmaker has said that he wants a new challenge at another club."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13706f7eed544b9288b03cce1ff7ddac94a449a8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96fbba4c18b226e6d9d2dd7d158257fd","title":"womens world cup 2019 power rankings usa germany england quarter finals","story":"The United States are the only team from outside Europe in the quarter-finals, in which England will play with the jury still outSpain have lifted the air of infallibility around the world champions but the USA are the title holders for a reason. Spain gave them a very tough test, providing a blueprint for others hoping to breach a defence that hadn’t conceded since April. America had a huge helping of luck: watch the incident for Megan Rapinoe’s second penalty over and over and from every angle and it is still hard to tell whether there was contact, or enough contact, with Rose Lavelle to warrant the spot-kick.The hosts were unlucky to have Valérie Gauvin’s first ‘goal’ ruled out by VAR in their last-16 meeting with Brazil, given that the goalkeeper Barbara did not have the ball under control when Gauvin nodded it beyond her. The forward scored from a great Kadidiatou Diani cross, though. Thaisa’s equaliser showed France remain vulnerable, and Griedge Mbock’s goalline clearance was as magical as Amandine Henry’s winner. Now France face the USA. The winner has to be favourite to lift the trophy.Germany are cruising, and doing so without the talismanic Lyon midfielder Dzsenifer Marozsan, who has a broken toe. They have scored nine and conceded none on their way to a quarter-final with Sweden. The depth of their squad is scary. They had their fair share of VAR help against Nigeria – the review upholding Alexandra Popp’s header despite an offside Svenja Huth potentially obstructing the view of the keeper Chiamaka Nnadozie. Favourites for the final in the non-USAFrance side of the draw.It was hard to draw conclusions from England’s 3-0 defeat of Cameroon. In the second half Phil Neville’s defence looked particularly chaotic but given the crazy circumstances it is hard to analyse. A bottled penalty call and two possible red-card incidents could have seen the score become more emphatic but a marginal offside also saved England from a goal that would have blown the game open. Not really tested yet, and Norway will be tough.If you have not fallen a little bit in love with the Italians you have not being paying enough attention. Valentina Giacinti and Aurora Galli’s goals against China showed Italy are much more than their rock-solid defence. A 20-year absence from the World Cup has been ended in style. Now they get to test their defence against some of the best forwards in the world when they face the Netherlands in Valenciennes, which will be a sea of orange. Italy, having topped their group above Australia and Brazil, have demonstrated anything is possible.The brilliantly organised Norwegians deserved to progress at the expense of Australia. With Caroline Graham Hansen back after an injury scare, they dominated. Hansen had 11 of Norway’s 27 shots, the most by a player in any game thus far, and Sam Kerr was kept quiet by the Chelsea duo Maren Mjelde and Maria Thorisdottir. Only Elise Kellond-Knight’s clever goal direct from a cornertook the game to extra time and penalties. Norway will have a field day if England’s defence play as they did against Cameroon.The European champions took on Asian champions Japan in possibly the most exciting tie of the last 16. A moment of inidual magic from Lieke Martens was followed by a superb team goal from Japan. The 2011 winners should have finished off their European rivals as Mana Iwabuchi ran riot but they couldn’t quite make the breakthrough and a cruel handball decision gave the the Netherlands a fortunate 90th-minute penalty. The Dutch look great going forward but remain incredibly fragile at the back.Former Chelsea goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl was the star against Canada, pulling off a stunning save to deny Manchester City’s Janine Beckie a late leveller. Sweden had struggled to break down the Canada defence but Stina Blackstenius clipped the ball over Stephanie Labbé to ensure passage. Sweden have not really been tested beyond their 2-0 loss to the USA in Group F. Next up, though, are Germany in a rerun of the 2003 final.A cruel exit as the influential Lyon player Saki Kumagai’s limp arm got in the way of Vivianne Miedema’s strike to give the Netherlands a penalty, and victory, in the 90th minute. Japan blooded youth in preparation for a home Olympics next year but having found some rhythm they will be frustrated to not have gone through. Very unlucky.Like Japan, they exit with their heads high. The extremely soft late penalty that gave the USA their win was a harsh blow for a resilient side who kept the Americans from scoring from open play. They exposed a weakness in the USA’s backline: press them hard and they will make mistakes. With La Liga Iberdrola pumping significant investment into the league this team will get better.It is hard not to put Brazil top for Marta’s impassioned call to arms alone. Playing the hosts was always going to be tough for a side who lost nine consecutive games in the run-up, so to come from behind to force extra-time was impressive. Now though, as Marta said, they need a new generation, with this likely to be her, Cristiane’s and Formiga’s last World Cup.The Matildas continued a poor run against European opposition. A slightly more assured defence helped limit Norway to a single goal but they lacked fluency and service to Sam Kerr was limited. Penalty misses from Kerr and Emily Gielnik stood in stark contrast to Norway’s confident conversions. Never quite met expectations.The big question was why didn’t Christine Sinclair take Canada’s penalty, which could have levelled the score against Sweden, with 20 minutes to play? Having had one saved by Lindahl in a pre-tournament friendly she asked Beckie to oblige. Lindahl saved and Sinclair, Canada’s record goalscorer, will likely always wonder what if. They struggled to score, not having enough support for Sinclair, and their defence could carry them only so far.Unlucky to fall behind against Germany to another controversial VAR decision, having had Wendie Renard’s missed penalty for France against them retaken after their keeper stepped marginally off the line. With Barcelona forward Asisat Oshoala injured and Ngozi Ebere and Rita Chikwelu suspended they had an uphill task from the off. Escaping a group with the financial muscle behind France, Norway and South Korea was impressive.Failed to reach the quarter-finals for the first time and went out having scored one goal. Key striker Wang Shuang, who plays for PSG, failed to find the net. The European teams have caught up and overtaken China and, with participation in the country low, there are no clear signs of a reversal.Let’s be clear: Cameroon did not let football down, but they did let themselves down. The elbow to Nikita Parris’s face, the late challenge on Steph Houghton and the tantrums at correct VAR decisions were embarrassing from a team who really impressed in their group.

And while some of it is painted in broad strokes, other parts of the city are virtually true to life. Standing in Parliament Square, with Westminster Abbey to your right and a gaggle of protesters to your left, it’s hard to believe the game was mostly made in Canada.There are differences. The underground, used as a fast travel network in-game, is askew: Trafalgar Square station reappears despite being renamed in 1979, and the Tube map has been given a neon-on-black redesign that, one hopes, the real TfL would never OK. Other changes are in service of the dystopian future the game depicts – a world in which the tech trends of today have combined to destabilise the old order, and cast millions into a precarious existence.This London is post-Brexit, post-Scottish independence – and post-democracy. The pound has been routed, the citizenry has switched to cryptocurrencies and the government has been bankrupted by the resulting fall in tax revenues. A wave of inward migration has sparked another political crisis, leading to more people than ever before being rounded up, placed in multiplying deportation centres and removed from the country.Into this steps DedSec, the amorphous, Anonymous-style anarchic hacker collective of the Watch Dogs series. In earlier games, the player has been cast as a member of DedSec, but in Legion they are DedSec: there is no main character, but a network of citizens from all over the city. Those citizens can be essentially any human in the game, from the bouncer outside the pub, the granny in the park, or the local bobby patrolling a residential neighbourhood – and you can play as any one of them.Every single cut-scene, line of dialogue and animation has been written, recorded and captured multiple times. The very same story mission won’t just sound different if you play it with an east London gangster to a City lawyer – the characters will move differently, say different lines and fight in different ways.A Britain torn apart by technological unemployment and a migration crisis, ruled by authoritarian populists and opposed by a grassroots collective – it all sounds rather political, doesn’t it? This has been tricky territory for publisher Ubisoft in the past. The company has a recent history of releasing games that flirt with contemporary political discourse while refusing to admit that it’s doing so.Take Tom Clancy’s The Division 2, sold with imagery of a crumbling White House and a downed Air Force One . Yet the game’s creative director Terry Spier said last year that it was “not a political statement”, and the game was simply “here to explore a new city”. Then there’s Far Cry 5, set in a distinctly Trumpian Montana that has been taken over by extremist, cultist militia. Despite ample opportunities to use its setting to say something worthwhile, the game bottled it, and the politically charged imagery and themes became nothing more than set-dressing.So it is refreshing to hear Clint Hocking, Watch Dogs Legion’s creative director, discuss the origins of the iconography in the latest game. “We’d spent a year working on London before the Brexit vote happened, so we inherited Brexit along with the rest of the world,” he says.“But that’s not to say it isn’t an important part of our world fiction, and our backstory. In our game, Brexit definitely happened but we’re not trying to say it is the cause of the problems in our world … the things that caused Brexit are the causes of the problems in our dystopia.”The contemporary political trend that feels most reflected in the vision of Watch Dogs is not membership of the European Union – it’s the surveillance state. The real London already has more CCTV cameras than almost any other city in the world, and in 2002 Transport for London created posters proclaiming the capital “Secure beneath the watchful eyes” of cops and cameras. So the in-game propaganda of Watch Dogs encouraging citizens to “report suspicious activity” with the hashtag #Securelondon feels, if anything, rather tame.Hocking emphasises that the team was sensitive to British mores. Designers used a mailing list to submit questions for their British colleagues on the project to answer about London life. And one major difference between the UK and the American settings of the previous games is guns. While players can be armed, attributed in-game to the prevalence of 3D printers, if you don’t take out your guns, the enemy won’t take out theirs. “We didn’t want to give the politan police guns, and in fact, some of the police characters might be sympathetic to your cause,” says Hocking. “The motivation of DedSec is to bring people together.“Division is the root of the problems of the world of Watch Dogs, and they’re trying to get the people of London to put aside their differences and fight the real threats.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d9ef179b82dfc0c35c82c9015b65f408c9d9a83/362_0_3146_1889/master/3146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4c3712dc9f648d5e39f61b65c4a8ed2","title":"lift ban ivory trade southern african leaders summit","story":"Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia, Angola and Namibia call for embargo suspension to allow sale of hugely valuable stockpilesSouthern African leaders have renewed calls for a lifting of the ban on the ivory trade as debate over the “unfair” embargo escalates.At a wildlife economic summit in Zimbabwe, leaders of the five countries that make up the Kavango-Zambezi conservation area – Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia, Angola and Namibia – raised the issue ahead of the August conference of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in Geneva, Switzerland.The Zimbabwean president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, told the UN-African Union summit that his country is sitting on a $600m (£470m) cache of ivory that includes rhino horns. The leaders want a suspension of the ban to allow them to shift enormously valuable stockpiles.There were calls for an end to the international “one size fits all” legislation that, Mnangagwa said, prevents the countries from using proceeds of sales of the animal products to help their conservation efforts.Cites’ rules, which countries and states adhere to voluntarily, prohibit trade in endangered flora and fauna, with varying degrees of protection given to more than 35,000 species.“We are gravely concerned, however, by the one-size-fits-all approach. Banning of trade is creeping into the Cites decision-making processes. We call upon the institution to resist the temptation to be a policing institution but instead to be a developmental organisation to promote conservation communities and sustainable utilisation of all wildlife resources.”He said the sale of ivory would help Zimbabwe maintain good conservation for the next two decades. Botswana’s President Mokgweetsi Masisi, who last month sparked controversy when he lifted the ban on elephant hunting, underscored the need to protect communities who, he said, face unprecedented attacks from wildlife.Mnangagwa said Cites should commend the region for overseeing the growth in elephant population and incentivise conservation by allowing free trade.“Because of our good governance, our animals are now many. But when we say can we use them so that the people who protect them can get good houses, by selling some of the things that ought to be sold so that it benefits the communities … some of them believe that animals have more rights.“… But people whose houses were destroyed by animals want compensation. If we could sell some of this ivory, it would go towards maintaining conservation.”The Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) said farmers living near conservation areas had lost more than 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of crops to straying elephants.A growing human population, meanwhile, has led to people encroaching on game parks and forests.Zimbabwe is developing a policy to limit conflict between humans and wildlife as it moves to ease friction over resources. It also wants to see the Cites ruling relaxed so it can sell more animals. Between 2012 and 2018, Zimbabwe sold 98 elephants, mainly to China.Cites’ secretary general, Ivonne Higuero, said ivory trade would be among the topical issues for discussion at the conference in August.She also said, however, that African countries were ided on the sale of ivory, with a coalition led by Kenya pushing for Cites to maintain the embargo.This counter proposal, according to Higuero, seeks to place southern African elephants in Appendix I of Cites, which identifies species that are the most endangered among its listed animals and plants.“As secretary general and hearing these proposals, I must say it is time that there was an open discussion about these issues … Countries want to have this on the table.”Max Graham, CEO of Space for Giants, which has launched a report showing the potential for growth in Africa’s nature-based tourism, said the continent could utilise tourism as an alternative to wildlife trade.“There are many alternatives that can earn Africa’s governments and its people rewards from their wildlife, while also protecting that wildlife. We would point to the huge opportunity tourism offers: it’s growing faster in sub-Saharan Africa than anywhere else, and visitor numbers could double by 2030,” Graham said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34241d7a958a24bc0a52be6a3ba502580b55aae8/0_341_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29099b8b43e65da8f49d78a88564c97f","title":"tell us about the one lifestyle change that worked for you","story":"As part of a series exploring how one change can make a profound personal impact, we want to hear from youWhat is the most impactful lifestyle change that you have made that has improved your health and wellbeing?

I’m shocked. She has no respect,” tweeted one user in Japanese.“I like Kim Kardashian, but please pick a name other than Kimono if it’s underwear,” wrote another.In Japanese the word “kimono” means “something to wear”, while Kardashian’s use of it appears to be a play on her first name. The clothing line’s website offered no explanation for the choice of name and Kardashian West has yet to respond to her online detractors.Not everyone was opposed to the name, with some arguing it could offer a chance to promote a traditional outfit that is declining in popularity in Japan. Once a standard of the Japanese wardrobe, the kimono is now often reserved for special occasions such as weddings and coming-of-age ceremonies and is mostly worn by women.While the elaborate traditional outfits might appear to have little in common with the snug items in Kardashian West’s clothing line, kimonos are often hugely expensive and are also known for being hard to wear. Women sometimes hire experts to help them to dress in kimonos because the outfit requires seemingly endless nipping, tucking and strapping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/692ec1ffe4d99d74a178ac1b54b5207b08579619/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=737c36e631065adf3c95df394f3ca3bf","title":"no scorpios no meat eaters rise of extreme flatsharing ads","story":"It’s a landlords’ market these days, which means Generation Rent has to abide by some frankly bizarre stipulationsThe two-bedroom flat in Turnpike Lane, north London, seemed run-of-the-mill. Laura Evelyn, an actor looking for a new place to stay, didn’t like the decor particularly – the fake leather sofa and glass dining table weren’t to her taste – but her would-be landlord was friendly enough. But as she was leaving the viewing, the owner handed her a sheet of paper. When Evelyn read it, she was flabbergasted.It contained a list of 31 rules that Evelyn, aged 35, would be expected to abide by if she moved in. Showers couldn’t last longer than 15 minutes. She was allowed two visitors a month, who must be approved two weeks in advance. After eating, she must wash up, and immediately return to her room. And if she left dishes in the sink, she’d be charged £15 a pop.Most people are used to abiding by rules – and good manners – when cohabiting with others. Have sex quietly, don’t hog the bathroom and never microwave mackerel, unless you are a monster. But, in effect, what Evelyn’s would-be landlord wanted wasn’t a flatmate he just wanted her to pay his mortgage and disappear.This is an egregious example of the worst inequalities of the housing crisis, but also not as unusual as you may think. Browse Spareroom or Gumtree, and you will see similarly extreme housemate adverts. There was the £650-a-month London flatshare where tenants were forbidden from Skyping their family in the evening. There are the rogue landlords who offer to waive rent, in exchange for sex. Then there are the lighthearted ones. Are you a postgraduate student looking for a double room to let in Brixton? Come this way – provided you aren’t an anthropologist. (Sociologists and social psychologists are welcome.)What these adverts reflect is that Britain is going back to being a nation of renters. Home ownership levels have plunged, with a quarter of UK households expected to rent privately by the end of 2021. In 2017, British tenants paid a record £50bn in rent. Young adults form “Generation Rent”, with homeownership a distant dream for those professionals on average incomes but without the large deposits needed to get on to the housing ladder.The night before I speak to a 28-year-old PR worker who lives in north-east London, she ate sweets for dinner in her bedroom. Why? Because she finds her live-in landlord’s rules so restrictive that she avoids communal areas such as the kitchen. She is expected to abide by a checklist taped to the back of the front door, which insists that hair straighteners are turned off, and lists the various doors, windows and skylights that must be locked prior to leaving. In the bathroom, her other housemate stuck a note to the mirror, requiring all spittle to be wiped away immediately. “The level of micromanaging … it’s madness,” she says. Her landlord even installed a smart plug on her hair straighteners, which she remotely controls via her phone. She wants to leave, but moving house is expensive and her £600-a-month budget is low, meaning that she is stuck for now. Her mental health has deteriorated. “You’re always stressed,” she says. “You think: ‘If I see her, is she going to complain about something?’”Expecting prospective tenants to live under a quasi-feudal regime reflects the power wielded by landlords in our property-centric society. “These restrictive ads amply underline the extent to which power, like wealth, is concentrated in the hands of landlords,” says Portia Msimang of the pressure group Renters Rights London. “Some people get overexcited by that power.” Some of these restrictions may even be illegal, she points out. “The renter would have a very strong defence against any attempt at eviction on the basis of breach of unfair terms.” But without root-and-branch reform of the UK’s housing provision, such behaviour seems likely to continue. And it’s not just landlords who have the power. Existing tenants of desirable houseshares can afford to be choosy about who they live with, screening candidates on everything from their dietary preferences to their political beliefs or their star signs. (Unlike gender or sexual orientation, these are not protected characteristics under the law, and so these stipulations aren’t illegal.)Which is bad news for Capricorns. In April, a New York City housing advert went viral after a prospective applicant was rejected for belonging to that star sign. Megan, a 24-year-old from Brighton, thinks that the no-Capricorn advert is ridiculous because, in her experience, Capricorns make perfectly good housemates. It’s Cancers you need to watch out for. “I had a housemate who was a Cancer, and it wasn’t good for either of us.” A Gemini, Megan’s preference would be to live with Leos, Taureans or Capricorns. She would ban Cancers from moving into her house should a room become available – and probably also Scorpios, if she’s being honest. “It’s like, how many more emotional Cancers or Scorpios will I live with, before I acknowledge it’s not meant to be?”There can be darker factors at work: a 2018  investigation found that people from ethnic minorities face discrimination when looking for houseshares. For every 10 positive replies to an inquiry about a room for rent sent by a prospective renter called “David”, inquiries from a “Muhammad” received only eight. Sometimes, racism is coded more overtly: the writer and director Yero Timi-Biu recently made headlines after she posted a text exchange with a landlord asking where her parents were from and it went viral. “Where demand for accommodation outstrips supply, landlords, agents and other renters can pick and choose,” says Msimang. “If they’re bigoted people, they pick and choose in line with their bigotry.”But houseshare ads can exclude certain groups of people for more understandable reasons. Clare is 33 and advertising a spare bedroom in her house in east London. Prospective housemates must not eat meat in the house, as Clare and her flatmates are vegetarians or vegans. “I find meat really unsettling,” she says. “Where people see food, I see something dead.” If someone moved in and then started eating meat, she’d probably ask them to leave, she says.LGBT-only houseshare adverts are also common. For many queer people, they are necessary to create a home in which they feel safe. Jender Anomie, a 27-year-old artist from Bexhill in East Sussex, would prefer to live with fellow queer people. “I’m sure this is the same of many marginalised groups,” Anomie says. “Living with heterosexual people can be really trying, and it seems unnecessary suffering if you have access to another, more welcoming type of living space.”At their heart, many housemate adverts are about looking for like-minded people. But you can overegg it. In 2014, Henry Blanchard, a young entrepreneur, posted an advert looking for flatmates to “come and join us in ‘Reinventing Living’”, and thereby inadvertently spoofed the toe-curling excesses of the Silicon Valley tech-bro culture. (“Do you believe in passion, integrity, positivity and working smarter, not harder? … Picture the scene – waking up at 6 every morning for a group run or yoga with the house.”)Looking back on the ad now, the 33-year-old cringes. “I was in this startup bubble … I think the house ad was a reflection of that. I wanted to bring my work into every part of my life.” Blanchard did manage to find “like-minded creators” willing to move into his #disruptive houseshare, but they never secured a suitable property. It’s probably for the best. “I had this idealised version of what I thought my life should look like.” What would he think if he saw that advert now? Blanchard laughs. “I would think: ‘I hope it works out for you.’”The best houseshare adverts use humour to make serious points. Travis Nemmer’s 2017 advert for a flatmate in Washington DC went viral after the 27-year-old attorney laid his political cards on the table. “I am a Republican, who will occasionally say nice things about our president. If that’s a dealbreaker, I assure you that you will have no trouble finding some kinda commune.” Nemmer says he didn’t want anyone to be “blindsided” by his political views, given that DC is a fiercely liberal city. The person who moved in was leftwing, so the advert worked. “I wouldn’t say people didn’t want to live with me because I’m a conservative. I don’t have any problems getting along with people regardless of politics. They probably don’t want to live with me because I’m messy.”Williams is, perhaps, also a victim of the housing crisis. He is disabled and struggles to find accessible rental properties – which meant that when he found the property, he agreed to be the lead tenant, responsible for its entire monthly rent. Luckily, he found someone to take the room “She got the humour,” he says. But he probably wouldn’t go down the same route again. “This one didn’t quite hit the nail on the head.”At the housing crisis continues to escalate, more of us will be forced to live with strangers well into adulthood. “I’m too old to be flatsharing,” says the PR worker. “I shouldn’t have to do it. I’m tired of doing it.” These adverts tell stories of exploitation and abuse: greedy landlords infringing their tenant’s fundamental rights in ways that are possibly illegal.But it’s not always bad. The authors are often just searching for common ground with the people who will share their homes – whether it’s with a fellow astrology-lover, a vegan or someone who also gets what it’s like to be marginalised. For Anomie, living in queer spaces gives her access to “unconditional love and understanding”. These adverts are about more than whether you are a Capricorn or vegan, a conservative or a growth hacker. They’re about people, just trying to get along."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0b7cd86e3e7bda5ed22c75821e7ef99c498270/0_207_5895_3537/master/5895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a14cd8904226a1e646f99813b958d695","title":"ebola is back can it be contained podcast","story":"The current outbreak of the deadly virus in the DRC has been called the most complex public health emergency in history.

But he added: “The idea that Jeremy doesn’t make his own decisions is laughable.”The spokesman said Corbyn was continuing to consult with trade unions and members of Labour’s national executive committee about the party’s Brexit policy.“It’s a consultation to try and find a position that the party can unite around.” He said that process would be completed “in the next few weeks”.He said there was already a consensus over avoiding a no-deal Brexit and over the shift towards advocating a public vote on any deal, as announced by Corbyn after last month’s European elections.But he added that there was still no agreement about what could be on the ballot paper in any referendum Labour might support, and whether the party would now commit to campaign for remain.He added that a referendum was “not the only part of our policy on Brexit. We want to see a general election. We want to see a public vote on any deal. Our alternative compromise plan is still on the table.”Beckett declined to say which advisers and Labour figures she was talking about.Shadow cabinet ministers had been expecting Labour’s position to move to full backing for a remain position in a second referendum at a meeting on Tuesday.But Corbyn is understood to have told shadow cabinet ministers there would be further consultation with unions and a decision on the next step in the coming weeks, to the frustration of several present including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell.Sources in the room said McDonnell had said he was “under the impression we were making the decision today” on how to advance Labour’s position. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, also questioned why a decision was not being taken and said it was “about showing leadership”.Speaking at a car industry conference on Tuesday, McDonnell was asked directly whether the Labour party was campaigning for a second referendum. “Well, I’m arguing the case,” he replied. “The discussion we are having in the Labour party now, and it is no secret, is what would our attitude be if there is a referendum?“I’ve said personally I’d vote for remain. I campaigned for remain because I can’t see anything better than what we have got at the moment. I can see the consequences in terms of jobs and living standards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d92a73be140f99ba20a89c1124721957443ad46/0_0_5585_3351/master/5585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29cea8e7e80c90fac7ef512c522167b2","title":"can my choices really make a difference to the environment","story":"Do our actions have a real impact on the future of the planet, or are our environmental efforts just a drop in the ocean?  Anna Turns considers how our lifestyle choices contribute to the bigger picture This summer, my family and I will take the ferry to France instead of flying off to warmer climes. We eat much less meat nowadays and we’re saving to buy an electric car. But in the midst of a worldwide climate crisis, can my choices really make a difference?The short answer is: of course. The view that the choices we make as consumers don’t affect our planet’s health is increasingly considered both untrue and irresponsible take the plastic bag charge or the rollout of smart meters, for example. Both rely on seemingly small adjustments to everyday life that, when enacted en masse, lead to something greater: the plastic bag charge has greatly reduced plastic waste, whereas smart meters help to make the energy grid more responsive. Both signal a seachange in how we’re engaging with the climate crisis.This is crucial, says Armistead, because “our actions make the most impact when recognised by those in power as a demand for further action – when our small actions help open up the political space for greater action.”Alice Bell, co-director of charity 10:10 Climate Action, agrees that we have to act socially to cut carbon emissions. “We all have a part to play in changing our culture,” she says. Take cutting down flying: we can amplify our efforts by talking about our decision, sharing images on social media of the train journey we have taken instead doing what we can to create a cultural shift. Consider Greta Thunberg. Last August, the Swedish schoolgirl began a school strike to demand action on climate change – in March this year, 1.6 million young people around the globe followed suit. “It was a social act,” says Bell. “She sat in a public place, she wrote a sign so people would engage and she spoke about what she was doing.”So while we can all be catalysts for change, we don’t exist in a vacuum we are part of a complex ecosystem – and so advocacy is key. “If we want to make the changes we need, at the speed we need to do it,” says Bell, “we have to be clever about how change happens.” For Bell, that means a simultaneous bottom-up, top-down approach: making inidual efforts while pressuring governments to make large-scale legislative change.Cardiff University’s Prof Lorraine Whitmarsh, who has spent the past five years working on the Low Carbon Lifestyles and Behavioural Spillover programme, agrees: “Policymakers don’t feel they have the mandate to take ambitious action unless there’s grassroots demand for it. Equally, a top-down approach makes it easier for everybody to do things substantially differently.”Studying 7,000 people across seven countries, Whitmarsh explored the idea that taking up one eco-behaviour, such as recycling, may lead to another, such as eating less meat. The report concluded that any spillover depends on motivation: if a person wants to make that first shift, they’re more likely to make further positive changes than if told to do so. Crucially, spillover only occurs when the similarities between behaviours are recognised as all contributing to a low-carbon lifestyle. Hence the importance of both advocacy and reinforcing positive social norms.While the report acknowledges that no lifestyle is identical, and not all changes are possible, it highlights five key “behaviours” that can be adopted when working towards a low-carbon lifestyle. Civic action and political engagement is key, but four other everyday areas are also emphasised: transport, at best living car-free and avoiding air travel diet, cutting down meat and dairy “investment decisions”, such as opting for energy-efficient appliances and household energy choices, including installing intelligent thermostats and smart meters.It takes, therefore, a myriad approach for change to reach a tipping point. Just as attitudes towards smoking changed, there’s been a shift in opinion towards electric vehicles (EVs). In the Norwegian capital, Oslo, a combination of government policy – from VAT exemption to fast-charging stations – and municipal initiatives such as free parking and access to bus lanes – means that every third new car sold is battery powered.We all want to make big changes to help our planet, but sometimes to make big changes, we have to start small.

Can the UK’s energy system be decarbonised by 2050? Here’s what we knowThis June, the UK government committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – making it the first major economy and G7 member to do so. But what does that mean? And how are they planning on getting there? The integration of renewable energy sources is key, for starters, and a lot needs to happen to the way we produce, supply and store energy. From the stats on our increasing reliance on the “right” energy sources, and a look at how we’re changing our lifestyles for the better, to what might stand in our way, these are our energy facts and figures as they stand.Electricity Transmission owns and runs the network of cables and transformers within the National Grid. It transmits electricity from power stations to homes, schools, hospitals, factories and other places. The network consists of 4,474 miles of overhead line, 969 miles of underground cable and 346 substations.Eleven further connections linking the UK to other European countries are also planned or under construction (including the 450-mile long North Sea Link to tap into Norway’s hydropower, and the 470-mile long Viking Link to harness energy from Denmark’s wind farms), which could meet a fifth of the UK’s electricity needs by 2025.Source: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)Coal consumption has fallen from 157m tonnes in 1970 to 11.8m tonnes in 2018, and the UK’s seven remaining coal power stations are set to close by 2025. In May this year the UK also went 18 days without burning coal to generate energy – the longest streak the country has managed since 1882.A third of the UK’s electricity generation came from renewables in the third quarter of 2018 – a new record. That percentage is likely to go even higher: the government hopes that offshore windfarms alone will provide a third of our electricity by 2030 – with the number of jobs in offshore wind potentially tripling to 27,000 in that period.What will be the world’s biggest offshore wind farm, Hornsea One – 75 miles off the Yorkshire coast – is also due to be completed in 2020. It will cover an area five times the size of the nearby city of Hull, and the 174 turbines – each taller than London’s Gherkin building – will be capable of powering 1m homes. In times of peak demand, the smarter energy network will also help to better integrate energy from offshore wind.Source: Committee on Climate Change  Energy Saving TrustAccording to independent government advisory body the Committee on Climate Change, which campaigned for the government’s net-zero commitment, the foundations are already in place to achieve that goal, including initiatives such as increased tree planting and reducing emissions on farms.Source: Committee on Climate ChangePart of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy grid more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed. By collecting data on our energy use through smart meters, our network can better understand, plan for and balance out peaks and troughs in demand, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources. Of course, smart meters can’t help Britain meet its carbon emissions targets on their own but, with the smarter, more energy efficient grid they help to create, they are a start.

Several women said they had considered terminations because of fears over the impact on family finances.Interviews with women experiencing domestic abuse suggested that the two-child limit was regarded as a financial barrier for women and children trying to escape an abusive relationship and created “stark choices between poverty and safety”.The limit, introduced in April 2017, restricts the child element in universal credit and tax credits worth £2,780 per child per year to the first two children. The government has championed the policy, which will cut the benefits bill by £1bn a year by 2021, as an incentive for people on benefits to work.However, official figures show most families affected are already in work, while the study found those affected felt strongly that the two-child limit unfairly punished hard-working low income families at a time – the birth of a child – when they most needed support.One mother told researchers: “The safety net doesn’t exist any more for my family … You feel really distressed that you have turned to the welfare state and that there is nothing available for you and now I must turn to charity. What am I paying taxes for?”Alison Garnham, the chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, which published the report along with the Church of England, called for the two-child limit to be abolished. “We wouldn’t turn away a sick child from our hospitals or stop them going to school and yet the two-child limit denies families the support they need from our social security system when they experience tough times, trapping kids in poverty,” she said.The limit will push an additional 300,000 children into poverty by 2024, while 1 million children already below the breadline will be pushed into deeper hardship, the report says. To date an estimated 160,000 families and 600,000 children have been affected, and this could rise to 1.8 million young people over the next five years.Ministers have defended the policy on the basis that it forces parents to take responsibility for their choices and teaches them that “children cost money”. However, the study says the policy has been barely publicised by government, and only half those affected were aware of it before they became pregnant.Many women interviewed said their third child had been unplanned. For them, the study noted, “the only way to exercise choice would have been to have a termination, which some of the women simply would not contemplate for moral or emotional reasons and which those in Northern Ireland would have been unable to access even if they had wanted to.”Relatively few claimants appeared to have used a “rape clause” covering a third or subsequent child conceived as a result of sexual assault.“The overriding picture emerging from both the survey and interview findings is that families affected by the two-child limit are facing severe and ongoing financial difficulty, which cannot be overcome through careful budgeting or just ‘tightening their belts’, but instead leads to real deprivation,” the report says.A government spokesperson said: “This policy helps to ensure fairness by asking parents receiving benefits to face the same financial choices as those in work. Safeguards are in place and we’ve made changes this year to make the policy fairer.”This year the government cancelled much-criticised plans to extend the two-child policy in universal credit to children born before the policy was introduced. It exempted kinship carers after the high court found last year that the policy as it affected this group was “perverse and unlawful”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf9ac7dd7fbef2e34255dfa9f2d12aa46ae728b/0_0_2439_1008/master/2439.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=35f666345d981f81878dd1dbede8fb51 1290w","title":"betfred refuse punter 189000 pounds after mistake betting slip horse racing","story":"• Gambler will take case to arbitration in claim for £212,000• Punter says was told bet would be settled on intended wagerA bookmaker has refused to pay £189,000 to a punter who made a mistake in writing out a six-horse accumulator and included Bailarico, who finished third, rather than Bialco, a winner. David Smith, a 60-year-old from Loughborough, still received £23,000 from his spectacularly successful choices on that day a fortnight ago but contends that Betfred should have paid him £212,000 and plans to take the matter to the arbitrator Ibas.Smith’s other five selections in the bet all won: Ardera Cross (40-1), Indian Temple (7-1), Shanroe (9-2), Pennsylvania Dutch (15-2) and Sir Busker (4-1). He argues that he clearly intended to include Bialco, as he wrote “2.15 P” next to Bailarico’s name. Bialco won the 2.15pm race at Perth, whereas Bailarico was third in the 3.40pm at Goodwood. Smith also wrote down the odds that were being offered about Bialco at the time.Smith says he returned to the shop during the afternoon’s racing, after two of his horses had won. Upon checking his slip, he realised his error and explained it to shop staff, at a time when Bialco had won but Bailarico had yet to race. He says he was assured that the bet would be settled on Bialco and that the decision in the shop, after the other horses had won, was to settle it at £212,000. But when the bet was referred to Betfred security for authorisation the settlement was changed to £23,000.A Betfred spokesman told the : “Unfortunately the customer had written Bailarico on his slip which was running in a race at Goodwood that day and finished third. Our rules state that we settle on the named selection.”Smith said: “I’m not happy about the way they handled my complaint. There was nobody to explain what really happened.” A regular in the Loughborough shop, he feels sure that his bet would have been corrected at the time of being placed if the manager, who knows him well, had been working and had checked his bet as normal.Smith is being assisted by Paul Fairhead, an online campaigner for punters, who points to another Betfred rule allowing the firm to split stakes between two horses if a bet is deemed ambiguous. Applied in Smith’s case, that would give him an additional payout of approximately £90,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af5f2139226eea28617c92dadff33b2d3637128f/329_511_4970_2982/master/4970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1783fd63a75978dd8466922d678410ab","title":"eastbourne tennis news johanna konta halep wozniacki","story":"Johanna Konta has failed to get through to the Eastbourne International quarter-finals after being knocked in straight sets by the world No 62, Ons Jabeur.The British No 1 was beaten 6-3, 6-2 and will now head to Wimbledon with only four grass court matches under her belt after also losing in the last 16 at Birmingham.Konta, the 14th seed, appeared to be playing well in Eastbourne but could not come up with any answers to Jabeur, who was in impressive form.

The longtime cricketer turned longtime commentator was on Good Morning Britain this week, when he was asked about his Brexit strategy, rather in the same way you might get Jeremy Hunt on the show and seek his opinion as to whether he can even bear the poignancy of not being able to watch Jimmy Anderson in World Cup conditions like these.Having immediately attempted to flirt with Susanna Reid with the same gossamer touch you’d expect of a man convicted of a brutal assault on a former partner, Boycott moved into other arenas of incompetence.Of most perplexing note was his carefree enthusiasm for the UK exiting the European Union without a deal. “We fought two world wars and we came out on top,” analysed Boycott. “Why? Because of the spirit and determination of the British people. That’s what the British people do … we’re a strong people. We’ll survive!”Yes! Have it! Such a relief to hear someone saying we should just get out there and smash it and not agonise at length over the consequences of how we play it lest anything ends up going wrong. What’s the worst that can happen, and so forth.On the other hand: who on earth is this devil‑may‑care adventurer, this fast-and-loose buccaneer, this cricketing personality type simply made to get the foam fingers wagging appreciatively at the Big Bash? Can it really be Geoff Boycott? I think it’s the sheer cavalier abandon that makes you wonder what might have been. Back in the day, it often felt to cricket watchers as though Boycott was in for an entire summer, every time he was in, inching defensively and absolutely without apology toward the low 20s by lunch.“It was more of an occupation than an innings,” the Times’s John Woodcock wrote witheringly of one such anti-spectacle, an innings on the first day of which Boycott went a full 45 minutes without scoring, among various other lowlights.But will you just look at how he Brexits! By the seat of his actual pants. Without pants, if necessary. If only Boycott’s future self could have written one of those letters to his 27-year-old self. “Come on Geoffrey, my lad,” this might have run. “I know that right now you think people have paid their money to see you and you’re keen to treat that investment with the utmost contempt, ideally by blocking your way to a joyless 50 by close of play, which will have the joint effect of letting the England selectors see exactly how you feel about their pointed call for ‘brighter cricket’. I know that right now you value being boring, technically faultless and incredibly reliable as virtues. I know you make no apologies for taking obsessive amounts of care. But listen: we won two world wars – and by the time you get to the age of 78, you’re going to be one of those weirdo subclinical nostalgics who somehow reckons they actually fought in them. Let’s have a bit of flair! Let’s have a bit of fuck-this-for-a-game-of-soldiers! Let’s have a sense of adventure and hang the consequences! I’m sure you can see the long-term folly of thinking everything through as much as you do …”Strange, even in the mad post-referendum world, to think the often haplessly self-centred Boycott is now regarded as a thought leader of sorts. This latest tirade is far from the first inkling of how post-Boycott Boycott would differ from Boycott-era Boycott. The writer Tim de Lisle once observed that Ian Botham and Boycott swapped roles in retirement. Despite having been the great showman, Botham’s commentary was plodding and dreary, while the previously dour Boycott insisted on whacking every point around the ground.Yet even accounting for this, I am not sure that the fabled disinhibition of old age is what lies behind Boycott’s political vision for the UK as delineated on GMB this week. In fact, it is rather easier to see his whole career as being of a coherent piece when you remember it is all underpinned by the same inability to think much – or indeed anywhere – beyond what suits himself.

Indeed, he has already made a quiet re-entry, Marchons Ensemble having run in his name when second in a Limerick maiden recently. The colt is entered in a race at The Curragh’s Derby meeting on Friday.This is news because few figures in the history of racing, in Britain or Ireland, have attracted so much sustained controversy as Bradley. Without wishing to go over it all again, let us simply remember that he was warned off for five years after it was found he had passed information for reward.There is some precedent for subsequent lenience to Bradley, since the British Horseracing Authority allowed him a one-day licence in 2010 to ride in the Legends race at Doncaster. However, the BHA told him five years later that it did not see him as “a suitable person” to hold a trainers licence and it also turned down an application for his wife to register as an owner.But Bradley’s name can once more appear in a racecard, even in Britain if Marchons Ensemble is ever sent over here. Interestingly, his silks are the white, yellow and blue ones carried to victory in the Ebor 20 years ago by Vicious Circle, three weeks after Bradley had bought the horse in his capacity as a bloodstock agent to a couple of friends.Horse Racing Ireland has discretion over whether to allow a person to register as an owner. I asked them to explain their decision in regard to Bradley but as yet I have not had a reply. If I get one, I’ll post it on here.Not everyone realises it but this is one of the best midweek days’ racing, outside of the major festivals, with major handicaps at either end of the country. It’s Carlisle Bell day in the north, Bibury Cup day down in Wiltshire and anyone who’s taken the afternoon off to follow the action has made an excellent decision.I thought I was napping an interesting outsider in the Bell but he doesn’t seem to have interested anyone else, as The Navigator (3.30) is generally 25-1 and even 33s in a place or two. He represents a shrewd yard, that of Dianne Sayer, but that will only take him so far in this race, for which the list of trainers represents a critical mass of shrewdness.The grey ran a really interesting race over this course and distance last month, his first outing since a novice hurdle in February. Slowly away and detached early, he ran on dourly to be beaten less than a length.In this much bigger field, he should hopefully get another strong pace to run at, though there is an increased risk of traffic problems on the way through. It’s pretty interesting that connections, having used a claimer for both his runs last month, now switch to Paul Mulrennan, who is four from six for Sayer this year, six from 15 overall and actually scored for her on a 6-1 shot over the same course and distance last week (Redarna, who goes again in the 3pm ‘consolation’ race).Rake’s Progress (4.00) at 9-1 is my shot at the Cumberland Plate, although I’m a bit nervous that the going description is now back to mostly good to firm. His best form is with some cut, but there ought to be at least some cushion in the ground after all the recent rain.From the in-form Heather Main yard, he slipped to an attractive mark before beating an Ian Williams horse that I fancied at Goodwood, battling on well. He’s only a couple of pounds higher and has a good draw if he’s capable of holding a decent early position.At Salisbury, King’s Slipper (3.50) is the one that catches my eye. He looked one to follow when achieving a career best at Kempton in April, his first run after being gelded, but he flopped in the Thirsk Hunt Cup early the next month.For whatever reason, Clive Cox’s yard had a pretty thin time of it in May but things are looking cheerier now (734 in the past fortnight) and I’ll take a chance on this one bouncing back, though he’s drifted out to 10-1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7861e4f61ba54109d792189a15dcf9a2a51c736/60_365_4241_2544/master/4241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55ac0e14272f02e4f3bbb47d7171191d","title":"new zealand v pakistan cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"43rd over: New Zealand 172-5 (Neesham 61, de Grandhomme 46) A cracking stroke from de Grandhomme, who picks Amir’s slower ball and pumps it over extra cover for four. New Zealand are right back in this game, which is very good news for England, and quite good news for New Zealand too.In other news, it seems Chris Gayle is for turning, at least off the field.42nd over: New Zealand 166-5 (Neesham 60, de Grandhomme 42) A rare poor delivery from Afridi is flicked past short fine leg for four by Neesham, who is playing a gem of an innings. Some good running brings another seven runs for New Zealand. They were 97 for five after 31 overs at drinks, since when they have scored 69 from 11 overs.41st over: New Zealand 155-5 (Neesham 52, de Grandhomme 39) New Zealand takes three singles from Shadab’s final over. He finishes with figures of 10-0-43-1 the one was Kane Williamson, which makes it a very good spell of bowling.“Point of order to Louise Wright,” says Phil Harrison. “If you can’t hum a Swans song, you certainly can’t describe anything performed by Sunn O))) as a ‘ditty’.”Crikey, it’s all kicking off at Noise Club.40th over: New Zealand 152-5 (Neesham 50, de Grandhomme 38) Back comes Shaheen Afridi, whose first ball is a magnificent slower ball that beats de Grandhomme and just misses the off stump. Neesham then works him for a single to reach a streetwise half-century from 77 balls. He made 26 from his first 58 balls and 24 from the last 19.“I’m keeping this one in the back pocket, you know, just in case...” says Adam Dawson. “As featured on the excellent CNDNME video comp ‘Carry on disarming’ - and unusually you can hum along to it. PS it’s Sunn O))) ... -)”The only metal band with a smiley in their name.39th over: New Zealand 150-5 (Neesham 49, de Grandhomme 37) Wahab has such a sharp bouncer, and de Grandhomme does well to snap his head out of the way. The next ball is a bit fuller, the oldest trick in the book, and de Grandhomme misses a leaden-footed swipe. He exacerbates Wahab’s agita by top-edging the next ball straight over Sarfaraz’s head for four. de Grandhomme has ridden his luck throughout this innings, but he is making useful runs. New Zealand have scored 53 from the last eight overs.38th over: New Zealand 144-5 (Neesham 48, de Grandhomme 32) A good over from Amir, full of variation, yields two runs and a play-and-miss from de Grandhomme.“Do you remember that Jimmy Anderson fella?” says Ian Copestake. “He exists, yeah?”I was thinking about him yesterday, when it looked like a David Willey day. I wouldn’t have picked Anderson. He was tucked up by allcomers at the last World Cup, so I can understand why England moved on, and there was nothing to suggest they needed him. If they were using a Duke’s ball it would be different.37th over: New Zealand 142-5 (Neesham 47, de Grandhomme 31) New Zealand are inching towards a competitive score: 200 good, 220 better, 240 best. Neesham clouts a pull for two off Wahab, who has been warned for running on the pitch.“The highest placed Englishman on that World Cup averages list is the estimable Mr Gower,” says Colum Farrelly. “He’s forty-sixth.”He’ll be 47th once Vincey hits his straps.36th over: New Zealand 139-5 (Neesham 45, de Grandhomme 30) Amir replaces Imad Wasim and bowls an eventful few deliveries to Neesham. A short ball is swatted for four the next ball threatens to bounce onto the stumps after a defensive stroke, so Neesham hits it away with the back of the bat and the last delivery of the over is a beautiful slower ball that Neesham mis-hits a couple of yards in front of the fielder at long-on.“You can’t hum a Swans song,” upbraids Louise Wright. “It’d be like whistling Sunn o))’s latest ditty. You can intone them and you can wail them, but you can’t hum anything that tortured.”35th over: New Zealand 132-5 (Neesham 39, de Grandhomme 29) de Grandhomme muscles a short ball from Shadab to cow corner for six. This is becoming a useful partnership, and they have slipped a couple of gears in the last few overs. Since the drinks break – and the introduction of Imad Wasim – they have scored 35 runs from four overs.“What is going on with these pitches!?” says Jeff Docherty. “Weather-affected, instructions from above... we’ve spent four years honing our batting \u0026amp bowling skills on flat fast wickets and now they’re all turgid 250-run jobbies. Why, how, what?”No idea. You’re welcome! Cricinfo’s George Dobell, whose word I’d always trust, says it’s because of the weather affecting preparation rather than the ICC trying to scupper our brave bilateral boys.34th over: New Zealand 121-5 (Neesham 38, de Grandhomme 19) Neesham drives Imad Wasim up and over extra cover for four. That should be the end of Imad, because he and Hafeez have bowled ten overs between them.33rd over: New Zealand 115-5 (Neesham 33, de Grandhomme 18) Neesham drives Shadab handsomely for six, the first boundary of his 59-ball innings, and then de Grandhomme edges a booming drive wide of slip for four. Shadab ends the over with a vicious leg-break that beats de Grandhomme.“The highest World Cup average,” begins Ekagra Agarwal. “Andrew Symonds in ‘03?”Nope, he is second on the list. The winner is...32nd over: New Zealand 103-5 (Neesham 26, de Grandhomme 13) Imad Wasim comes into the attack. That’s a slightly negative move from Sarfaraz, although he may just want to complete the fifth bowler’s allocation as soon as possible. Six from the over.“Of course this is predicated on England beating India so it’s dead in the water to start with,” begins Phil Harrison, “but I hadn’t quite registered how fragile NZ’s position is. Lose today. Quite possibly lose to Australia on Saturday. And provided England beat India (HAHAHA!), England v NZ is a shoot-out for fourth spot with Pakistan qualifying in third. This could all get very dramatic, couldn’t it?”Well, yes. Pakistan v Bangladesh could be a decider as well. 31st over: New Zealand 97-5 (Neesham 24, de Grandhomme 9) de Grandhomme leans into an optimistic drive off Shadab, slicing it just short of the fielder at short third man. Drinks.30th over: New Zealand 94-5 (Neesham 22, de Grandhomme 8) de Grandhomme just survives a run-out referral after a direct hit from the excellent Shadab. It was so close, with only the toe of his bat over the line when the stumps were broken.“Highest average at the World Cup,” says Yash. “Surely Lance Klusener!”Nope, he is fourth on the list. He averaged 140.50 in 1999 (with a strike rate of 122 as well).29th over: New Zealand 88-5 (Neesham 21, de Grandhomme 3) New Zealand are going nowhere. It’s an awkward pitch, quite subcontinental, and Shadab has now bowled six overs for just 14. There is, as we mentioned earlier, a chance that New Zealand could be dragged into the mire if they are hammered today. That would affect their net run-rate and leave them potentially vulnerable should they lose their last two games against Australia and England. I still think they will be fine, though, even if they lose all three games.“Hi Rob,” says Rabia Dada-Oughton. “Our house has been ided this morning with me (Pakistani) and husband (English) supporting different teams. However, that last wicket had my English husband singing Dil Dil Pakistan (a song anyone who has attended a Pakistan cricket match, will know!). Magic.”That’s such a coincidence, because I’ve just been humming the English cricket anthem.28th over: New Zealand 86-5 (Neesham 20, de Grandhomme 2) It’s hard to see New Zealand getting out of this hole now that Williamson has gone. Pakistan are all over them. Neesham survives an appeal for caught behind off Wahab, although that appeal came only from the keeper Sarfaraz. He decides not to risk Pakistan’s review.“Are any of the OBO readership old enough to recall a time when this tournament was blighted by an imminent surfeit of dead rubbers?” says Brian Withington. “Oh what bliss it was to anticipate a procession to the semi-finals, whilst contemplating alternative formats that would deliver more competitive cricket. Perhaps England just need some cricketing version of Snakes \u0026amp Ladders whereby vertiginous tumbles can be quickly followed by a plucky ascent? I think Pakistan may have already trademarked that format, though.” 27th over: New Zealand 84-5 (Neesham 19, de Grandhomme 1) That wicket brings Williamson’s tournament average down to a lamentable 138. Quiz question: who has the highest average in a completed World Cup? Shadab gets the big wicket with a gorgeous legspinner! It dipped, turned and kissed the outside edge as Williamson pushed forward defensively. Sarfaraz, up to the stumps, took a sharp catch to spark wild celebrations. Pakistan Zindabad!26th over: New Zealand 82-4 (Williamson 41, Neesham 18) This is a compelling struggle, with both teams not quite sure what a good score is on this pitch. Three singles from Wahab’s over. We’ve still had only one boundary in this partnership, and that came from a false stroke.25th over: New Zealand 79-4 (Williamson 40, Neesham 16) “This World Cup,” says Abhijato Sensarma, “has been as fascinating and bizarre as the time I heard Britain’s next prime minister claim he painted model buses.”24th over: New Zealand 77-4 (Williamson 39, Neesham 15) Wahab reminds Neesham of his menace with a rapid bouncer, and follows up with a good delivery past the edge. Neesham has been the less secure of the two, but then he is batting with an all-time great. Williamson has played expertly.23rd over: New Zealand 76-4 (Williamson 38, Neesham 15) Two from Shabad’s over. New Zealand have restored a bit of order with this partnership soon they’ll have to think about taking this innings to the next level. I think they’d be fairly happy with anything over 200.“Apologies, I take it all back about you English supporters being Eyeores yesterday,” says Danielle Tolson. “I’m not enjoying this very much. Though the good sport in me (the likeable NZ part, natch) completely supports Afridi in the sporting sense. Very exciting. Re: Peter Salmon in regard to Kane W’s demeanour when he took over from Brendan McCullum he was described in the more relaxed bits of the NZ media as a ‘sentient batting robot’ or when doing IVs as ‘like a very polite young man talking to his friend’s parents’.”Eyeore is my noew favourite typo. As for Williamson, he’s a great advert for not being on Twitter.22nd over: New Zealand 74-4 (Williamson 37, Neesham 14) Wahab Riaz replaces Hafeez, who has sneaked through seven overs for 22, and almost picks up Williamson with three consecutive deliveries. The first takes the inside edge and flies just wide of the stumps for four the next two zip past the outside edge. Lovely bowling from Wahab.“Nice to see Simon ‘Hey, let me get you some lemon juice for that paper cut’ McMahon asking the big questions,” sniffs Matt Dony. “Anyway, what is sport for, if not the inducing of breakdowns? Cricket, football, rugby, darts, tiddlywinks, whatever you can only ever enjoy so much success before the crashing wave of disappointment welcomes you into its bleak, cold arms. It’s where we sports fans belong. We try and fight it, we try and deny it, but it’s the inescapable truth. (I’m reneging on my earlier positivity. That was very much based on NZ king Pakistan.)”21st over: New Zealand 68-4 (Williamson 31, Neesham 14) This has been a sensible, low-risk partnership from Williamson and Neesham. They haven’t hit a boundary and have scored only 22 in eight and a half overs more importantly, they haven’t lost a wicket.20th over: New Zealand 64-4 (Williamson 30, Neesham 11) This is a relatively quiet spell, with spin at both ends. Saying which, Hafeez beats Neesham with a fine delivery that curves in and then turns sharply the other way. “Even when it’s your own side that’s on the wrong end of one of their rock’n’roll outbursts, if you don’t laugh along with and love the absolute mayhem of Pakistan cricket, you simply don’t love cricket,” says Harkarn Sumal. “If you understand cricket and this doesn’t make you giddy, then you’re dead on the inside. Mind you, I wouldn’t want to be a Pakistan fan. It’d send me to an early grave. They are absolute showbiz.”I couldn’t disagree less. They’re a glorious affront to logic.19th over: New Zealand 60-4 (Williamson 28, Neesham 9) The legspinner Shadab Khan replaces Shaheen Afridi, who bowled a devastating spell of three for 11 from seven overs. Two from his first over. Although Pakistan are clearly on top, they will not feel comfortable while Williamson is quietly stockpiling runs.“Hi Rob,” says Garry Sharp. “I refer not to cricket punditry but to the London Horse Manure Crisis of 1894. When the city was dependent on equine energy, getting rid of their bodily waste was a massive problem and economists predicted that if growth persisted then within a decade all London streets would be three feet deep in the stuff. They didn’t see the motor car coming. My point is that extrapolating is a dangerous game (as NZ are demonstrating) and so England will do an, er, handbrake turn and shoot off in a victorious direction.”18th over: New Zealand 58-4 (Williamson 27, Neesham 8) Neesham gets away with a loose stroke, mistiming a lofted drive off Hafeez that lands just in front of Imad, running back from mid-on.“Hi Rob,” says Damian Burns. “I took Stokes out of my starting 11 at the beginning of the tournament. He didn’t do enough in the Pakistan series for me. However he has proven to be England’s most useful player of the tournament. Not necessarily in the winning games, but in the last two losses he has batted with absolute maturity and class. All it will take to get through the next two games is for Buttler to find his form alongside him. Our top seven are so good we really shouldn’t need to talk about the depth of batting in the England line-up at all.”Yes, I thought that was an exceptional innings from Stokes yesterday, one of the best he’s ever played. He looked so determined to win that game. The old cliché – ‘it’ll take something special to get rid of him’ – really did apply.17th over: New Zealand 54-4 (Williamson 26, Neesham 5) Afridi is on such a roll that I’d be tempted to bowl him straight through. Another challenging over goes for only a couple Afridi’s figures belong in a Test match in the late 1980s: 7-3-11-3.16th over: New Zealand 52-4 (Williamson 25, Neesham 4) Four from Hafeez’s over, a quick bit of filler in between overs from Shaheen Afridi. “Yes, despair everywhere,” says Pete Salmon. “And then there is Kane Williamson. How good is he? I realised the other day I knew nothing about him except his cricket, so I spent a couple of hours watching interviews with him (I work from home). And the glorious thing is, I’m not sure there is anything about him except for cricket. Gloriously, deliriously genial and dull. Even his finest moments were recalled only after some prompting. I feel like he’d like to win the World Cup in the way your accountant might like to find you some deductions - it just shows he’s doing a good job, and if you could mention him to your friends that would be great, no worries if not. A man who definitely goes to sleep each night the moment his head hits the pillow. Love it.”15th over: New Zealand 48-4 (Williamson 24, Neesham 1) Shaheen Afridi continues, and quite right too because he’s in the spell of his teenage life. He slips another cracking delivery - perfect length, a soupçon of seam movement - past Neesham’s attempted drive, the highlight of another maiden. His figures are stunning, but they don’t flatter him: 6-3-9-3.14th over: New Zealand 48-4 (Williamson 24, Neesham 1) Williamson tries to sweep a leg-stump delivery from Hafeez, gets in a tangle and falls over, but he manages to fall sideways rather than out of his crease. There may also have been a bottom edge, though it was a desperately difficult chance for Sarfaraz if so.“So, Rob, enough of this negativity,” says Simon McMahon. “How are things shaping up at Old Trafford ahead of the new football season?”13th over: New Zealand 46-4 (Williamson 23, Neesham 0) Neesham plays and misses at his first ball, and for a moment it seemed like he’d been caught behind as well. Pakistan are well and truly on one. There’s no finer sight in sport.“Let me share my frustration with the NZ selection,” says Ben Bernards. “Munro has had a shocking run of form in the last 12+ months, reaching 50 only once. He only sneaked into the squad as cover and made the starting XI due to an injury to his replacement as opener, Nicholls. Now that Nicholls is fit again and Munro has been (as you said) returning lower and lower scores, Nicholls should have been given a run out here, even more so considering Guptill is not performing either. Then we have Latham in woeful form with the bat, and a man in great form who is also a specialist wicket keeper (Latham is only a part-timer) not given a crack in Tom Blundell. I would also have liked to see Sodhi given a go in place of Henry, if only to give the former a run out before the semi-finals (and final!). While the concept of never changing a winning team has some merit, NZ have been solid rather than spectacular and with some braver selections could be even better while also ensuring more of the squad are not left undercooked for pending big matches. I expect we’ll lose today and the final chance to rotate the team will be lost.”Yes, there is an outside chance that New Zealand could be mugged of a semi-final place, especially if they lose heavily today. It’s unlikely, though, and I suspect they will be able to make changes against Australia.This is glorious bowling from Shaheen Afridi! Latham feels nervously for another superb delivery that straightens off the seam to take the edge, and Sarfaraz takes an easy catch. As with Taylor’s wicket, the length Afridi bowled was perfect. He has taken three for nine!12th over: New Zealand 45-3 (Williamson 22, Latham 1) Hafeez replaces Imad Wasim and concedes just one run from his third over. Latham has also been in poor form - his highest score in the tournament is 13 - so he is taking to get his eye in.11th over: New Zealand 44-3 (Williamson 21, Latham 1) Shaheen Afridi is 19 years old. He’s also tall, left-handed and capable of bowling around 86-88 mph. In other words he should become a serious bowler in the next few years. He’s pretty useful now, and a maiden to Latham gives him figures of 4-2-8-2.“Dear Rob,” says Uma Venkatraman. “I have been reading with great interest all the reactions to England’s defeat - much collective hand-wringing and teeth-gnashing. Have faith in your team, people. They can still win the next two games - New Zealand are yet to be tested, and India... well... they are capable of doing a Pakistan. So don’t give up hope... the cup can still stay home.” It can, but it would take quite a twist. I cannot see them beating India. Scyld Berry put it most succinctly in the : “It was not that England lost, but how.” The same applies to the Sri Lanka game. The Pakistan defeat didn’t really worry me, but the last two have been fifty shades of alarming.

He lends the hero, Garry Essendine, a mixture of twinkling charm and driving egomania characteristic of the kind of actor-manager Coward was portraying and possibly of the author himself. It is a richly funny performance even if Matthew Warchus’s production occasionally displays the frenzy that seems an ingredient of modern comedy. Scott’s Garry is, above all, a lost boy: a Peter Pan who has never fully grown up and who emerges from slumber sporting a piratical eyepatch and a waistcoat as if he had come from JM Barrie’s Neverland rather than dreamland. But Scott also wittily lapses into an outrageous theatricality to keep people at bay. He pouts and peacocks around in order to ward off unwanted lovers and importunate playwrights and to protect the little clique of chums that is essential to his wellbeing. As in Design for Living – in which Scott also starred at the Old Vic – Coward is writing about a bohemian world threatened by invasion from outsiders.In the original, the threat comes from a predatory female called Joanna with whom Garry sleeps in order to neutralise her capacity to upset the apple cart. Joanna here becomes Joe in the formidable shape of Enzo Cilenti and I am in two minds about the gender-swap. It heightens the idea of Garry as a sexual chameleon with the built-in ambivalence of the matinee-idol. But, given that the knock-on effect of the switch is that three of the major characters are now bisexual, you wonder why Joe is seen as a menace to Garry’s tight little gang. There may be a hint of misogyny in Coward’s original but there is also more dramatic logic.The chief joy, however, lies in watching Scott’s display of Garry’s boyish vanity. Accused of overacting, he beats himself about the face as if confirming the charge. Whenever mention is made of the Peer Gynt he was prevented from playing, Scott looks like a woebegone child deprived of a longed-for present. Funniest of all is his encounter with the playwright from Uckfield, Roland Maule, whom Luke Thallon invests with a lunging intensity. Prising his hand from Maule’s ferocious grasp, Scott dips it in a beaker of cooling water. But, while capturing Garry’s need to escape the clamorous demands of outsiders, Scott also has the orphaned look of stardom.Indira Varma is excellent as Garry’s separated wife, Liz. Possibly because she is so experienced in Pinter, Varma lends precise words real weight so that when she accuses Garry of “scampering about” the charge hits home. Together Varma and Scott also lend the climax a rueful tenderness that explains why the play was originally entitled Sweet Sorrow.

The FSB has said if Libra takes off, a different regulatory response will be needed.Quarles’s remarks follow a statement from the Bank for International Settlements on Sunday that politicians need to move rapidly to coordinate regulatory responses to any new risks.The FSB’s interjection over Facebook’s Libra, which is backed by more than 20 international institutions including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber and could launch as soon as next year, come as the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority said it would not allow the social media company to use the digital currency without close scrutiny.Andrew Bailey, the head of the UK’s FCA, confirmed on Tuesday that the organization was working with the UK Treasury and the Bank of England to monitor Facebook’s plans.The FSB and the FCA have joined Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, in alerting Facebook that if its plan to attract users to a new currency are successful “it would instantly become systemic and will have to be subject to the highest standards of regulation”.The European Union’s head of financial stability, Olivier Guersent, said ahead of Libra’s unveiling that Facebook’s potential concentration of both personal and financial data needed attention from regulators."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7ceb011f9b92bf53fb95080e49b459fac46746/0_174_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7fb44d44eb1696458f36f83b5f1cd3c","title":"20 best food tours around world lisbon lima havana hanoi","story":"Feast your eyes on these foodie walking tours, which reveal the flavours – and culture – of cities from Lisbon to Lima, Havana to HanoiTaste Porto’s tours are rooted in fundamental beliefs about the gastronomic scene in Portugal’s second city. First, Portuenses like to keep things simple: so, no fusion experiments. Second, it’s as much about the people behind the food, as the food itself. “Food is an expression of culture,” says US-born Carly Petracco, who founded Taste Porto in 2013 with her Porto-born husband Miguel and his childhood buddy André. “We like to show who’s doing the cooking, who’s serving the food, who’s supplying the ingredients, and so on.”She’s good to her word. Walking the city with one of the six guides feels less like venue-hopping and more like dropping in for a catch-up with a series of food-loving, old friends. Everywhere you go (whether it’s the Loja dos Pastéis de Chaves cafe with its flaky pastries or the Flor de Congregados sandwich bar with its sublime slow-roasted pork special) the experience is as convivial as it is culinary. And it’s not just food either.

So says 93-year-old Carlos Pina, whose father founded coffee roastery Negrita in 1924 and who still works there. One of only two roasteries left in Lisbon, Negrita is in a former stables in the Graça neighbourhood and has survived because the family own the building: elsewhere across the city rising rents are forcing decades-old businesses to close.Graça and neighbouring Mouraria are still home to families who shop in local stores, making the two neighbourhoods ideal for Culinary Backstreets: its food tours aim to give visitors an insight into the city’s history and culture. After breathing in the scent of coffee and roasted spices at Negrita, the tour takes in a traditional cerveceria for plates of clams, velvet crab and prego (steak sandwich). Then there’s a shot of cherry liqueur at a local corner store and a takeaway grilled chicken eaten in the no-nonsense bar of a neighbourhood association – another fast-disappearing feature of old Lisbon.A contrast to these insights into old Lisbon is tiny A Taberna do Mar, which opened in 2018 opposite the church and convent of Graça. Here chef-owner Filipe Rodrigues combines his love of Japanese techniques, Portuguese produce and a passion for sustainability to create inventive dishes. Try samples of horse mackerel bone broth and smoked sashimi of yellow fin tuna. Even the pudding, based on traditional egg custard, has a hint of sardine.

Yet, Culinary Backstreets’ tour – one of the newest among the company’s global offerings – illustrates just how much there is to discover in this hypnotic city. The tour begins outside the old city walls in Porta Capuana with a mid-morning espresso, rum baba and sweet, ricotta-filled sfogliatelle. Next up is a third-generation baccaleria for samples of salt cod, a “healing” glass of sulphuric water from Vesuvius, and a bruschetta-like snack in the city’s last traditional friselle bakery. The 10 stops on the five-hour tour offer much more than quick bites and photo-ops. The guides have fostered relationships with the bakers, vendors, and cooks who make this food scene unique, and this allows rare peeks into bakers’ ovens and chats with artisans. A stroll among the buzzing stalls of a local market highlights a slice of Naples in an area many visitors are unlikely to see.

It also ends at Nicoletta’s home, the cacti-lined 18th-century Palazzo Lanza Tomasi – a palace on the city’s seafront, where the Duke’s father, author Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, once sat to write the iconic novel, Il Gattopardo (The Leopard).“I have always cooked traditional, Sicilian dishes to preserve the heritage of the island,” says Nicoletta. The four-course menu changes seasonally but street-food inspired chickpea panelle, swordfish rolls and almond and pistachio pesto ruvidelli are examples of the recipes you can get hands on with in the palace kitchen, between herb foraging on the jasmine-laced terrazza and glasses of Sicilian wine.

There are crispy, oily, fried youtiao doughnuts, which are dipped into a freshly made sweetened soy milk that also helps wash down a dense cifantuan rice ball. This stodgy-and-satisfying Shanghainese dish combines white and red sticky rice, stuffed with salted duck egg and tart mustard pickles. These are enjoyed at Xiangcai Renjia, a Hunan-style restaurant that, in the morning, doubles as a breakfast joint, making use of the free seating to serve food made by the owners of the food stall next door.Next, the tour moves to the Xiangyang Road area of the Former French Concession, where visitors can sample pancakes, steamed buns and dumplings, all served from tiny holes in the wall. The classic jianbing, or Chinese crepe, is a fitting substitute for the sesame pancake that is traditionally the fourth “heavenly” breakfast item. Jianbing, which is best enjoyed straight off the griddle folded around egg, fried wonton skin, pickles and spicy sauce, can be traced back 2,000 years to north-east China but is now popular across the country as an on-the-go breakfast.Elsewhere, in a tiny sit-down place next door to the jianbing stall, there are rich and flavoursome pork-filled soup dumplings, served in a traditional bamboo steamer. Of course, breakfast in a city as cosmopolitan as Shanghai isn’t all about tradition: trendy coffee shops also serve western-style choices with Chinese characteristics.

Put simply, it is a reinvigoration of the sketch show. It is short (episodes are just 15 minutes a pop), it exists on a plane of gloriously busted logic, and it is the sole reason why I haven’t been able to dislodge a song about skeletons from my mind for the past six weeks.However, on closer inspection, I Think You Should Leave has one gaping flaw. There isn’t enough of it. Sure, Netflix has recommissioned it, but that still means we won’t see any more new episodes until 2020. As of now, only two hours of I Think You Should Leave exists in the world. Which is, to quote a man more profound than I will ever be, stinky.However, salvation of a kind still exists. I Think You Should Leave’s co-creator Tim Robinson has a smattering of work to be found elsewhere. On Netflix, you can find his episode of 2016’s little-loved sketch show The Characters, which, in retrospect, was the closest thing we have to an I Think You Should Leave pilot (the opening Sammy Paradise sketch easily stands alongside anything from his newer show). But the real gold is to be found on in his sitcom Detroiters (which for UK viewers is streaming in full on NowTV, with episodes also available to purchase on YouTube premium and Google Play).In Detroiters, Robinson co-stars alongside Veep’s Sam Richardson (who also appears in I Think You Should Leave’s legendary Baby of the Year sketch) as ad executives who exist to serve Detroit’s underperforming businesses. As premises go, it’s just about as down the middle as you can get. And yet it quickly unspools into a puddle of absurdity that’s just as finely honed as anything on I Think You Should Leave.The very first episode announces itself in a reasonable enough way – Robinson and Richardson interrupt a restaurant meeting to hustle for an opportunity to pitch for Chrysler – before its true nature unveils itself. The pair start throwing a ball around their office to generate ideas. The game gets ugly. Richardson bangs into a window. Robinson is amazed that it didn’t break, so they start hurling larger and larger objects at it. By the time they are finished, almost half the episode has passed. By the end, the plot has petered out in favour of brilliant, joyous, stupid set-pieces.And this is how the series continues. They spend one episode mucking around on a motorbike another attempting to nail the jingle for a local wig firm another reacting in horror to a defecating car. Fans of I Think You Should Leave have plenty to gnaw on here and the season one finale might just contain Tim Robinson’s finest ever skeleton gag which, given that he’s now technically the global poet laureate of skeleton jokes, is really saying something.Only two seasons of Detroiters exist. In its day it was badly marketed and little watched and the second season bears traces of network tinkering, with the key Robinson-Richardson relationship diluted with some less than convincing ensemble work. However, those who loved it loved it. At the end of last year, after Comedy Central sealed the fate of the show, Seth Meyers used Vulture to lobby for its renewal elsewhere. “There are so many wonderful comedies on television today,” he wrote. “Shows that present new and interesting perspectives and make you think about the world in ways you never have before. Detroiters was not one of those shows. Detroiters was an old-school cackler. The only thing it ever made me think was, ‘I can’t remember the last time I laughed this hard at a television show.’”Detroiters isn’t quite as avant-garde as I Think You Should Leave. By necessity, the leads in a sitcom do need to sometimes appear vaguely human.

The country’s highest ever temperature, recorded at two separate locations in southern France on 12 August during the same 2003 heatwave, was 44.1C.“At our local Potsdam station, operating since 1893, we’re set to break the past June record by about 2C,” tweeted Stefan Rahmstorf, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Eastern parts of Germany, including Berlin, are already experiencing their hottest June on record.High temperatures are expected to climb further throughout the week, from Spain to the Czech Republic, as the combination of a storm stalling over the Atlantic and high pressure over central Europe pulls very hot air northwards from the Sahara.Scientists say heatwaves can be particularly dangerous when they occur in early summer, before people have adjusted to seasonal norms. Europe’s 2003 heatwave resulted in the premature deaths of an estimated 70,000 people.A 2015 report on heatwaves and health, by the World Meteorological Organization and World Health Organization, found early summer heatwaves had been shown to be associated with greater impacts on mortality than later heatwaves of comparable or higher temperatures.A heatmap for France for 27 June, tweeted by the university meteorologist Ruben Hallali, next to the Edvard Munch painting The Scream, was widely shared on social media.From the low to mid-30Cs on Tuesday in parts of Spain, France and Italy, most weather models predict temperatures will rise by Thursday to the low to mid-40Cs in south and central France and north-east Spain, and the upper 30Cs in much of the rest of continental Europe.As authorities placed health services and retirement homes on alert, urged children and older people to stay indoors, handed out free water and recommended vigilance against dehydration and heatstroke, the French president, Emmanuel Macron said: “As you know, at times like these, sick people, pregnant women, infants and elderly people are the most vulnerable.“We must be vigilant and have preventive measures in place in order to intervene as quickly as possible.”France’s health minister, Agnès Buzyn, said the country was better prepared than in the 2003 heatwave, when 15,000 more people died than in a normal summer. “Our plans have got better and better,” she said. “Our alerts are more efficient.”Societal change was going to be necessary, Buzyn said. “We will have to change the way we live, the way we act, the way we work, travel, dress … We are going to have to change our habits and stop thinking these episodes are exceptional.”Among the first to be affected have been France’s high-school students, with the national brevet exams, sat by 15-year-olds, postponed by the education minister on safety grounds from Thursday and Friday until early next week.Brussels halted horse-and-carriage rides for tourists because of animal welfare concerns, Le Soir newspaper reported, while in Germany media reported a 32-year-old man in Hemer, outside Düsseldorf, had stripped naked in the frozen food section of his local supermarket in an effort to escape the heat.Rahmstorf said the current heatwave, following unusually high temperatures last summer that caused increased mortality rates, a decline in crop yields and wildfires inside the Arctic Circle, was consistent with climate scientists’ predictions.“Weather data show that heatwaves and other weather extremes are on the rise in recent decades,” he said. “The hottest summers in Europe since the year AD1500 all occurred since the turn of the last century: 2018, 2010, 2003, 2016, 2002.”Monthly records were now falling five times as often as they would in a stable climate, Rahmstorf said, adding this was “a consequence of global warming caused by the increasing greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil and gas”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89a1614b708ddfb2e30677753bfb5e0b2d97b215/0_276_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca6fdf7c265fc199c69c8bbebbd9e43b","title":"denmarks youngest prime minister leads new leftist government","story":"Social Democrats leader, Mette Frederiksen, 41, said late on Tuesday night that after three weeks of negotiations, she had reached agreement with three leftist parties to form the one-party minority government, a common arrangement in Denmark.But reports suggest she had to give ground on several of her party’s controversial hardline immigration measures to reach the agreement with her leftwing partners and form the third centre-left government in the Nordic region this year.“It is with great pleasure I can announce we have a majority to form a new government,” said Frederiksen. “Now we have reached the goal ... we have shown that when Danes vote as they have done, a new majority can turn their hopes into actions.”However, negotiations aimed at securing the parliamentary backing of the three other parties in the traditional leftist “red bloc” – the Social Liberals (Radikale Venstre), Socialist People’s party and Red Green Alliance – took 20 days, the longest negotiation period since 1988.The parties particularly disagreed on immigration, where the Social Democrats’ support for hardline policies that were long the preserve of the far-right nationalist Danish People’s party (DPP) proved a major obstacle.Arguing they were needed to protect Denmark’s prized welfare system, Frederiksen backed many of the Rasmussen government’s tough immigration measures.These included a ban on wearing the burqa and niqab in public and a widely criticised – if largely symbolic – “jewellery bill” that in principle allows police to seize refugees’ valuables to help pay costs.Last year, Frederiksen’s party proposed sending asylum seekers to special reception centres outside Europe while their requests were being processed, and suggested a cap on the number of “non-western” immigrants allowed into the country.In a series of concessions to her leftwing partners, however, Fredriksen has reportedly agreed that Denmark will drop plans to accommodate rejected asylum-seekers on Lindholm, an uninhabited island, and resume accepting refugees under the UN’s quota system, which it has not done since 2016.Frederiksen will present the 18-page government agreement, which also includes pledges to reverse years of spending cuts in education and healthcare, later on Wednesday, with the new government expected to be unveiled on Thursday.“This is extremely ambitious, I’m very excited,” Maria Reumert Gjerding of the Danish Society for Nature Conservation told local media. “It will make Denmark one of the most ambitious countries in the world on climate and if you’d asked a year ago whether we’d be here now, I’d have said ‘no’.”Mads Flarup Christensen of Greenpeace Nordic said the target would take “a historic effort” but “if a Social Democrat-led government can get this done it would be a huge win, both for the climate and for Danish voters.”Frederiksen, a fourth-generation Social Democrat, made her debut in parliament at 24, serving as employment minister and justice minister before taking over the country’s largest political party from Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the country’s first female prime minister.“She has been preoccupied with political matters since she was six or seven years old,” Frederiksen’s father, Flemming, a retired typographer and longstanding Social Democrat campaigner, told the Danish news agency Ritzau before the election. She joined the Social Democrats’ youth league at 15.The party’s victory is the third for the Nordic centre-left in the past year: Finland’s Social Democrats narrowly won elections in April on a promise to raise taxes to increase social spending levels, while Sweden’s centre-left party held on to power last year by pledging welfare reforms.However, analysts doubt the Danish Social Democrats’ hardline approach to immigration would necessarily work for other once mighty social democratic parties in Europe, currently searching for a way forward after struggling in recent elections – and in some countries, such as France, being all but annihilated.It is unclear whether the Danish Social Democrats’ attempts to win back working-class votes lost to the far right over immigration was effective: while the DPP shed more than half its support, its former voters opted more for Rasmussen’s Liberals than for the centre-left party.While the Social Democrats’ vote share declined compared with the previous 2015 elections, the Liberals’ increased. Moreover, support for parties further to the left, all of which opposed Frederiksen’s stance on immigration, grew strongly – which is what, ultimately, allowed her to form a government.The Social Democrats’ hardline on immigration may, therefore, have moved politics to the left in Denmark: although it lost more votes to the left than it won from the DPP, the net transfer allowed a leftist minority government to oust the centre-right.But many political scientists, in Denmark and abroad, believe it is far from sure the same tactic could be replicated in other European countries, where voters have turned their back on the centre-left mainly for economic reasons."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Ministry of JusticeTory leadership latest news: Jeremy Hunt under fire for \u0026#39snide\u0026#39 comment describing Leave voters as \u0026#39little England\u0026#39 Britain\u0026#39s highest paying degrees, according to graduate salary revealedHow lifeless body of toddler came to be slumped by dead father in river on US-Mexico borderPrince William: It would be \u0026#39absolutely fine by me\u0026#39 if George, Charlotte or Louis were LGBTComment: We need a First Amendment for the Internet to counter the troubling censorship of social media Beijing urges UK to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs after London bans tear gas exportsBoy, 12, arrested on suspicion of a homophobic assaultThree dead from \u0026#39thermic shock\u0026#39 in France as heatwave takes its toll across EuropeNeo-Nazi admits killing politician in crime that shocked GermanyMan charged over bomb hoaxes to Houses of Parliament and Super Bowl Could this shocking image of a man and his daughter who drowned in the Rio Grande bring the US migrant crisis to a head? Hundreds of Malaysian schools close over pollution fearsIan Brady allowed to interact with vulnerable boys at Wormwood Scrubs prison, new files showSan Francisco becomes first US city to ban sale of e-cigarettesPakistan thanks Facebook for prompt removal of anti-vaccine postsManchester City\u0026#39s Riyad Mahrez ordered to pay his children\u0026#39s nanny £3,600 in unpaid wagesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

want social media profiles wiped clean 18 lse study","story":"Researchers found children were \u0026#34outraged\u0026#34 when they discovered how much of their personal data was being hoarded by tech firms Duty of Care CampaignBanner: Duty of CareSocial media accounts of children should be automatically wiped when they reach 18, a new study has found. A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignTory leadership latest news: Jeremy Hunt under fire for \u0026#39snide\u0026#39 comment describing Leave voters as \u0026#39little England\u0026#39 Britain\u0026#39s highest paying degrees, according to graduate salary revealedHow lifeless body of toddler came to be slumped by dead father in river on US-Mexico borderPrince William: It would be \u0026#39absolutely fine by me\u0026#39 if George, Charlotte or Louis were LGBTComment: We need a First Amendment for the Internet to counter the troubling censorship of social media Beijing urges UK to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs after London bans tear gas exportsBoy, 12, arrested on suspicion of a homophobic assaultThree dead from \u0026#39thermic shock\u0026#39 in France as heatwave takes its toll across EuropeNeo-Nazi admits killing politician in crime that shocked GermanyMan charged over bomb hoaxes to Houses of Parliament and Super Bowl Could this shocking image of a man and his daughter who drowned in the Rio Grande bring the US migrant crisis to a head? Hundreds of Malaysian schools close over pollution fearsIan Brady allowed to interact with vulnerable boys at Wormwood Scrubs prison, new files showSan Francisco becomes first US city to ban sale of e-cigarettesPakistan thanks Facebook for prompt removal of anti-vaccine postsManchester City\u0026#39s Riyad Mahrez ordered to pay his children\u0026#39s nanny £3,600 in unpaid wagesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/28/TELEMMGLPICT000194102761_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq900leoZVuq6ru6F43OqP_nrDFz5WxMWkdtNYw7K1ZWo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"women want get pregnant should move countryside improve fertility","story":"Women who want to have children should consider moving to the countryside to improve their fertility, scientists have suggested following a new study.Research in Italy found women living in polluted areas are likely to have a shorter window in which to conceive due to the damage done by toxic particles to their ovarian reserve.The results showed a “reproductive disadvantage” even in areas significantly less polluted than the official European limit, which some parts of the UK regularly breach.They corroborate recent research from the US which indicates that smoking can hasten the menopause by as much as two years.Professor Antonio La Marca, who led the new study at the University of Modena,...Register for free to read this article, or log in to your  accountThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

I worked all of those hours and should be paid.Mr Sherratt said in a written judgment: The respondents have made an unauthorised deduction from the claimant\u0027s wages and are ordered to pay the claimant the net sum of £3,612.The respondents, in breach of contract, have failed to pay certain expenses to the claimant and are ordered to pay damages to the claimant in the sum of £150.00.Mahrez has until July 3 to comply with the order.Tory leadership latest news: Jeremy Hunt under fire for \u0026#39snide\u0026#39 comment describing Leave voters as \u0026#39little England\u0026#39 Britain\u0026#39s highest paying degrees, according to graduate salary revealedHow lifeless body of toddler came to be slumped by dead father in river on US-Mexico borderPrince William: It would be \u0026#39absolutely fine by me\u0026#39 if George, Charlotte or Louis were LGBTComment: We need a First Amendment for the Internet to counter the troubling censorship of social media Beijing urges UK to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs after London bans tear gas exportsBoy, 12, arrested on suspicion of a homophobic assaultThree dead from \u0026#39thermic shock\u0026#39 in France as heatwave takes its toll across EuropeNeo-Nazi admits killing politician in crime that shocked GermanyMan charged over bomb hoaxes to Houses of Parliament and Super Bowl Could this shocking image of a man and his daughter who drowned in the Rio Grande bring the US migrant crisis to a head? Hundreds of Malaysian schools close over pollution fearsIan Brady allowed to interact with vulnerable boys at Wormwood Scrubs prison, new files showSan Francisco becomes first US city to ban sale of e-cigarettesPakistan thanks Facebook for prompt removal of anti-vaccine postsTeach children about dangers of \u0026#39sexting\u0026#39 and pornography at school, first official guidance on online education saysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/04/21/TELEMMGLPICT000032877532_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwDgGh3pkom49KxtKngnUa36K9dyKixjq8GqZuuMTIBE.jpeg?imwid","title":"need first amendment internet counter troubling censorship social","story":"The repercussions of companies with an effective monopoly on our news using their position to impose ‘values’ should concern us allFor all its focus on ersity, Silicon Valley is about as ideologically erse as a vegan powwow The advent of modern technology has brought us extraordinary freedoms.

They can stay indoors.The seller added: I will need a day to get them ready and then documents will be supplied...after that I will carry them to American Airlines and register them for a flight.When they arrive in the UK, you will be notied and after that they will be delivered to your address.You only need to make an advance payment for the process and once you receive the cubs and confirm they are in good health, you pay our balance.They come with registration papers and a DVD...you can learn more from the disc. When they get bigger they will be perfect and you will enjoy them more.In a breach of Facebook guidelines, one trader advertised tiger cubs for £,, Transvaal lion cubs for £,, African lion cubs for £, and cheetah cubs for £,.Another seller claimed he could deliver a leopard cub from Germany to the buyer’s home address in Britain for £, plus an extra £ for shipping costs.He said: “Leopard cubs are fast selling pets and loved by many people around the world.”Under UK law people who keep animals that are wild, dangerous or exotic must apply to their local council for a licence.They are granted onlythey can provide necessary safety measures at their home and after a fee is paid.None of those selling exotic animals on Facebook mentioned the need to obtain a licence from the local authority.Animal welfare officials have called on social media companies to do more to crack down on the trade.Lis Key, of International Animal Rescue, told the Sun Online: “The internet does make it easier for the traders to hide – and easier for them to reach a vast market.Traders are increasingly turning to social media sites like Facebook to sell exotic animals.In terms of what the dangers are of selling exotic animals on the internet: clearly neither the buyers or sellers can have the animals’ best interests at heart. The former are seeking trophies, the latter are out to make money.“The animals are often kept hidden away in cramped conditions and go without food or water for long periods of time. Inevitably, many die before they are even sold. Perhaps they are the lucky ones.”Richard Thomas, from TRAFFIC, the wildle trade monitoring group, told the Sun Online: “It’s so dficult to police because most of the Facebook groups are private closed.“It’s a new avenue which the criminal underworld will try to exploit.Martin Simms, Director of Investigations at the League Against Cruel Sports, has dealt with cases including the attempted sale of dead bats online and the suspected sale of sperm whale teeth hacked from the mouth of a dead whale washed up on a British beach.He believes Facebook has a duty to halt any illegal wildle activity.There have also been cases where wild British hedgehogs have been passed off as exotic African Pygmy Hedgehogs by rustlers trying to sell them as pets on Facebook, as well as sites such as Gumtree.In a separate case, in April last year champion cage fighter Steve Dossett sparked outrage when he posted pictures of orphaned fox cubs on his social media page and asked for £ per animal.He posted photos of them in a box in his home and wrote “fox cubs for sale,  pounds lovely pets”.In another post under another photograph, he wrote foxes drinking milk out of a bowl, who wants one Horried animal lovers saw the ad and begged him to take the animals to a shelter instead.Eventually, a member of Dossett’s family called Surrey-based Wildle Aid Foundation and volunteers from the charity went to his flat and took seven cubs away.Facebook told the Sun Online it is investigating."},{"url":null,"title":"amsterdam red light district exxpose","story":"This is Amsterdam’s infamous Red Light District, where an estimated , sex workers do their best to entice men - often on weekend stag dos - to splash their cash.Over  million tourists visit the city each year, drawn by the citys liberal stance when it comes to drugs and buying sex.Yet the citys infamous red light district is now under threat.While buying sex is legal in the Netherlands as long as it is between two consenting adults, a campaign group spearheaded by feminists and Christians are trying to overturn this.The Dutch parliament is now set to debate whether to change the law, after the group Exxpose generated a petition with over , signatures.Campaigners cite the rise in sex trafficking victims as reason to criminalise buying sex  - in  alone there was believed to have been a  per cent rise in human trafficking, with the majority forced into prostitution.But sex workers in the red light district - who make up to £ an hour - are up in arms at the idea of their livelihoods being taken away.Theyve slammed feminist campaigners as patronising and asked -  how can you call yourself a feminist and try to take away other womens job Here, one sex worker and one young woman campaigning to close down the red light district go head-to-head...Make no mistake, it’s the sex workers who are in charge in the windows of Amsterdam.They set the rules and they decide whether to let a client in or not. They have a panic button that summons the window manager, andhe needs to, he’ll call the police without hesitation.There are so many police cameras and CCTV cameras in the Red Light District I’d say it’s actually one of the safest places to work, and I’ve been a sex worker for five years.I do it because I like it, not for the money or because it’s my only option.I’m , although I tell clients I’m  , and I have a few boyfriends, nothing serious.My le is pretty normal and I’d say I’m actually pretty privileged - I’ve got a degree and I worked as a nurse.When I was doing that I saw a lot of the patients craved physical affection. Sometimes they told you nicely, sometimes they misbehaved and grabbed you.But the patients weren’t put first at hospital, so I changed my job.Now, as well as the sex work, I’m a district nurse in people’s houses.I like it because it gives you more time to spend one-on-one with your patients and that’s what I like about sex work as well – it’s absolute quality time.I make a lot of people very happy and it’s rewarding in lots of ways. It’s not just the money.I prefer sex work to nursing but the people at Exxpose tell me I don’t know my own mind, and that’s what annoys me.They say the consent of vulnerable people is being bought by men with money and power – that’s a ridiculous generalisation. In reality it’s a business transaction like any other. I’m an independent entrepreneur who pays her taxes – quite a lot of taxes, actually. I get  eurosfor one hour.What the people behind the Exxpose campaign aren’t telling you is that it’s all rooted in their religion.They’re trying to save us when we don’t need saving – except maybe from the saviours themselves!They only see and hear what they want to – they think sex workers must have had a bad childhood or be addicts. They’re changing the facts to suit their argument.If two people of legal age agree to have sex, what’s wrong with that It’s true that there are bad things going on in the Red Light District, human trafficking does exist but its also re in other industries such as the restaurant trade – but I don’t see the Exxpose lot campaigning to make it illegal to buy a Chinese takeaway.It’s true that the Brits have a reputation in the Red Light District because of the amount of beer they drink, which goes hand in hand with some pretty bad behaviour.But let’s not forget our boys from the Dutch countryside, who can be just as boisterous.The Brits come here on stag dos, granted, but the same bad behaviour happens in Barcelona and Madrid – and there’s no Red Light District in those cities.Decriminalising sex work altogether it is the best policyyou ask me.I thought the whole point of feminism was empowering women to do as they please, not restricting their rights and opportunities.These Exxpose campaigners are young and naïve. I hope when they’re my age they’ll look back and think, What on earth was I thinking, telling other people what to do In the Netherlands it’s illegal to put puppies in a pet shop window because we believe it’s cruel – and yet we put our young women behind a window and pretend it’s normal.Tourists can walk around the Red Light District gawping at them without paying any money at all – those ladies are a tourist attraction and a lot of people get to see them in their underwear for free.Our campaign is staffed by volunteers, mostly young people. We see too much harm going on, too much human trafficking and we object to the normalisation of the buying of sex.It isn’t about a woman’s right to sell sex. Women should be free to do what they want with their bodies - I can totally understand why people do it and I think it’s a really brave decision to sell sex.I can totally imagine doing that.Demand for prostitution in countries who follow the Nordic Model, as this law is known, has decreased too.The idea is that making it a criminal offense to buy sex reduces sex trafficking.Estimates of the amount of prostitutes in the Netherlands y, but there are thought to be between , and ,.In , officials suggested that about £million a year was spent on sex transactions in the country. Sex workers there now pay tax on their earnings.In , the number of prostitutes in the UK was estimated as being ,, while one in ten men admit paying for sex.I grew up in a village near Rotterdam with my brother and four sisters.Things were comfortable, my mum was a nurse and my dad had his own aluminium business.They’re both Christians and that’s how I was raised, I still go to church and I’m married.It all plays into the campaign because I knew I was blessed growing up, that others didn’t have what I did. I worked in a rehab centre for a while and I saw that.I knew I wanted to help people, and after I saw a documentary about sex work things clicked.I spoke to my friends and we realised that we might be able to really change thingswe could get the government to talk about the issue.The problem is the men who want to buy sex here typically don’t respect women’s boundaries. They’ve drunk a lot and they behave extremely badly, asking for really cheap prices.They ask for things their wives won’t do: anal sex or role-play where the woman pretends to be a -year-old girl.There’s a lot of violence by customers, they want to have sex without a condom or be so rough the woman bleeds, and the women are under pressure to put up with it or clients won’t pay.Most people selling sex are vulnerable women who need the money or who have been forced into sex work. Because it’s legal to pay for sex, men using their services can ignore the horrible realities behind their actions.Europol research from  shows that Amsterdam is susceptible to human trafficking precisely because we have a big market for cheap sex.So it’s the so-called “ethics” of paying for sex which need to be revisited.There’s a saying in Dutch that everything that anything that can be bought can also be stolen. In you think about that, you can begin to see how prostitution fuels rape.We believe that you cannot buy consent under any circumstances. It’s the men and women who buy sex who would be punished under our proposal and most of them would stopit were made illegal.What do we propose for the women who will be made unemployed by the shrinking of the market  We’d get them into dferent jobs in safe environments which don’t make them vulnerable to sexual abuse.People say that our campaign is funded by the church mafia but that’s not true.Yes I go to church but this is a matter of feminist principle and our approach makes a lot of sense to the large number of young people who support us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris will only be our th Prime Minister since the very first, Robert Walpole, who was in office from  to .The fact that more than a third of them went to Eton , suggests that social mobility in this country is in terminal decline.Indeed, when it comes to the children of ordinary homes reaching the highest office in the land, social mobility is stone-cold dead.Fee-paying privilege provides the fast-track to power. Yet it wasn’t always this way.There was a golden age of ­meritocracy in the last century when it was normal for our PMs to be educated by the state.Eton was still a bastion of academic excellence in those happy years. So was Harrow, which has produced seven Prime Ministers, and Westminster, which educated six.But between  and , there was enough healthy social mobility in this country for Harold Wilson, Ted Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major — all educated at state schools — to become Prime Minister.Major and Callaghan didn’t even go to university. Callaghan couldn’t afford it, while Major left school at  with three O-levels.All five came from modest ­backgrounds, although Wilson, Heath and Thatcher were clever enough to get into Oxford University.For more than three decades, state-educated politicians competed with those who were the product of expensive private educations — and beat them to the top job.This is not an argument against Boris Johnson becoming Prime ­Minister simply because he went to Eton. Boris seems like the man most likely to prevent a Marxist government. This would destroy our economy — a fate far worse than either staying in or leaving the European Union.SoI was a Tory MP or party member, then I would probably prefer Boris to take on Brussels, Corbyn and the Brexit Party.But yet another old Etonian in  Downing Street proves that social mobility is nowhere near what it was in the last century. Andwe care about a fair and equal society, then that should concern us all.It feels signicant that the first candidate to be eliminated from the Tory leadership race was Esther McVey — the candidate from  the least privileged background, reinforcing the belief that Westminster is a closed shop.But when it comes to getting on in le, and even getting to Downing Street, it should not matter a damn where you were born.Your ability — and your willingness to graft — should matter far more than Mummy and Daddy’s bank ­balance.Le can never be totally fair. But two Old Etonian PMs in less than ten years is grotesque.  If there is to be a bright, shining future for this country after we leave the EU, there MUST be more social mobility.Once he has sorted out Brexit  and buried Corbyn, perhaps our Old ­Etonian PM will do something about it. Because inequality is still entrenched at birth.And that stinks.WHAT is mankind’s greatest invention  The Internet  The printing press  The steam engine  Penicillin If, like me, you are allergic to penicillin, then the gold shorts that Kylie Minogue wore in her Spinning Around promo probably have the edge on all of them. Kylie’s gold gear might make a comeback when she plays Glastonbury next Sunday.And  years after their debut, nobody has ever developed an allergy to them.As the wolf evolved into the dog, it sussed that making its eyes bigger made the humans go all soft and gooey inside.Dr Juliane Kaminski, of the University of Ports- mouth, says: “The evidence is compelling that dogs developed a muscle to raise the inner eyebrow after they were domesticated from wolves. It seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them.”Those puppy-dog eyes are designed to make your heart melt.Certainly when Stan, our Cavalier King Charles spaniel, looks at me with his enormous, big round peepers, I understand the three little words he is trying to say.Give. Stan. Cheese.IT is weird the way even the greatest TV series can go off the boil.On the surface, the second series of Killing Eve has everything that made the first such a blast.Jodie Comer is still brilliant as psychopathic assassin Villanelle, doing a iety of convincing accents and changing her clothes more often than Diana Ross in concert.Sandra Oh is again wonderful as the sexually confused, domestically challenged spook.But I have watched the entire second series now and it just doesn’t catch fire the way the first did.And that is because the first series of Killing Eve had three female stars in Jodie Comer, Sandra Oh and – behind the scenes – Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who wrote the script.Now Waller-Bridge has gone off to save the screenplay of the next James Bond movie.And Killing Eve badly misses her magic dust.JEW-HATING has become the racism  that is permissible.The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, told the Cambridge Union debating society that his Jewish friends: “Are not like the other Jews – that’s why they are my friends.”He got a laugh.If he had said “black” or “Muslim”, he would have been nicked.THERE are some scary TV shows out there.Doing Question Time is daunting because you can be certain that at least half of the audience will hate your guts.Have I Got News For You  is forbidding because the ageing team captains and presenters have been doing it since the dawn of time and are used to the show’s format .But nothing comes close to the terror factor of Mastermind.To sit in that black leather chair as the lights go down is to know true stage fright. So Hamish Cameron must have been a very brave man indeed.Hamish held the record for the most appearances on Mastermind –  – and after filming the final last November, he learned he had terminal cancer.Shortly before the final was broadcast last week, Hamish died at the age of .The BBC had considered postponing the broadcast as a mark of respect but Hamish had instructed his family that he wanted the show to go on.As someone who vowed “never again” after sitting in that hot seat just the once, I can only salute Hamish’s courage.The Mastermind catchphrase “I’ve started so I’ll finish” could have been invented for this fearless man.IF Heathrow gets a third runway, then the impact on the environment will be huge, with hundreds of extra flights landing and taking  off every day.And that’s just for Emma Thompson!Their honeymoon must have been filthy.ANDREA LEADSOM says she was told by senior Tory women that they could not back her because the party couldn’t have “another woman” Prime Minister so soon after Theresa May.But the Tories’ past willingness to be led by a woman is surely something to celebrate.  The Conservatives will almost certainly be on their third female Prime Minister before the -year-old male-dominated Labour Party has its first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why feel guilty about watching it The appeal of this show is fairly obvious — it’s the intimate access you get.Viewers feel like they’re on holiday on on the island too, as invisible guests.The ultimate fly-on-the-wall experience.We hear the most private of conversations, witness the most explosive fallouts. We even get in the shower with them.It’s so intimate that it feels the same as when you read someone ’s diary.Of course, we are watching insanely beautul people parading around in tiny scraps of swimwear. But no matter how gorgeous the contestants, each one is revealed to be as fragile as the next.I think that is where our real fascination lies.Surely they should all be full of confidence, looking the way they do  And yet they seem to be just as insecure as the rest of us.I like the fact that the show is a portal into a generation to which I no longer belong.I’ve learned so much about how young men and women behave and, until Maura uttered the words, I didn’t even know it was possible to have “fanny flutters”.Another thing I like is the escapism. Surely it’s no coincidence that Love Island is at peak popularity during a time when the news is totally dominated with gloom, doom — and Brexit.Personally, I’m also intrigued by the fake hair and nails — and the very y process of getting ready for a night out. I’m luckyI put a comb through my hair.The amount of make-up they manage to get on to their faces is astonishing — although the irony is that the one girl all the guys seem to like, Lucie, is a surfer chick who doesn’t wear make-up.There is also a real cruelty to the show, though. There is always someone better, someone more chosen. The voting process is brutal and leaves all of the contestants anxious about whether or not people like them.This show strips people of everything that is important, other than their body. They are measured on what they look like and little .As a result, lots of people have questioned the damage caused to the mental health of the contestants.There have been more than , complaints to Ofcom about this series already.But there are good things about Love Island.While it’s not exactly the kind of equality that women have been fighting for over the past  years, there’s no denying that female members in the house are as free as the men to proposition members of the opposite sex.In my day, all we had was: “My mate fancies you.” But Maura said of one guy that he gave her “fanny flutters”.When my daughter Sophia was asked to go on the show, she thought it would be fun to be on a free holiday. You can see her point.But no mother wants to watch their child on Love Island. We all know there are plenty of things our kids do that we don’t know about — and that’s the way it should stay.But it’s not just that. One reason I enjoy being part of the Apprentice is because it celebrates young people for their skills, ambition and what they achieve.They know they aren’t being valued for their looks — they are being valued for so much more than that.That said, no one’s self- esteem should be based on how others value us.I’ve often thought that my biggest superpower is that I really don’t care what people think about me.When I’m on the beach I’m not bothered about which bits and pieces are jiggling.Why  Because there is so much more to me than what I look like in a bikini.Or, rather, as a footballer’s we once said to me: “All I’ve got is my looks — at least you’ve got your personality.”I know it was a back-handed compliment. But you know what, I’m fine with that.LOTTIE Moss said on social media that she feels “uncomfortable” with her weight at the moment – as she posted a picture of herself in a dress on a night out.My first thought was she’s going to look back at those photos when she is in her fties and wonder how she could have felt uncomfortable when she looked like this.My second was she can’t worry that much because the dress she’s wearing is almost completely see-through.BOSSES of the Isle of Wight Festival have been criticised by two mental-health charities for banning Jess Glynne for le after the singer cancelled her show at the last minute, owing to anxiety.Anxiety is a debilitating condition which blights the lives of many people.I’m sorry to hear that Jess is one of those people.But when she knows she suffers from this condition, her choice to stay out partying with the Spice Girls until am on the day she was due to perform seems, well, questionable.Having been out drinking all night before work is enough to make even the most level-headed person anxious.To then go on social media advertising that fact, before effectively phoning in sick to work, is also a tad foolish.By doing that, Glynne gave the impression she chose partying over a commitment – and that is not a good look.If we have one job to do as parents, it is to teach our kids the importance of doing the things that need to be done, when they need to be done, whether you like it or not.When I see a young person doing what they said they would do, despite challenges, I know they’ve got backbone.It’s called resilience, grit, determination, and it’s about being irrepressible. Those are some of the most admirable traits a person can have.Anxiety is awful but it’s certainly not helped by partying until the early hours of a work day.THIS week there has been good and bad news for Boris Johnson. The good news is that it looks ashe is going to be our next Prime Minister.The bad news is not that early-hours row with his partner – it’s his new haircut.He used to have “The Trump”, a sort of comb-forward that hid his balding. But his barber has cut it off and, instead of the long-haired blond bombshell look, he’s now a blond basin with thinning top.Boris, please take it from me, when you go into a hairdresser’s the first thing you do is check out the hairstyle of the person holding the scissors.Anyway, I guess it grows back – and soon will be the haystack it’s always been. Now all Boris needs is a new suit.OOPS! My heart goes out to the mum of the rampaging toddler at a Swiss art show who knocked over a sculpture of a fly worth £,.My main question, though, is how a plastic sculpture of a fly could be worth so much money Someone, somewhere, is having a laugh. Right I WAS trying to work out what was unusual about the recent photo of actor Rob Lowe on the red carpet.I realised it’s this. He is a handsome, successful star who is still with his we – Sheryl Berkoff – after  years without trading her in for a younger model.And they look happy.A rare sight in Hollywood, so good luck to both of them.TO be fair, Sofia Richie pretty much pulled it off when she sported the latest bicycle shorts onesie – the trend you prayed would never happen.But all I can say is, I’m glad I don’t follow fashion.WHAT’S in a word  You might think nothing much. And it’s a small thing in a way, but Sainsbury’s needs to be called out for assuming on its hair-removal product that all doctors are male.Its instructions say: “Consult your usual doctor and show him the packaging.”No doubt lots of people will respond by saying that us women are far too easily offended.But it is assumptions such as this behind the fact that, for every £ a man makes, a woman only makes p.We have to stamp out this unconscious bias by calling it out every time we see it.AMAZING that it’s  years since Friends hit our TVs.But judging by pictures of its stars Jenner Aniston, , and Courteney Cox, , on vacation in their bikinis, they still look fantastic.Even more amazing is that they are genuine friends.It just goes to show thatyou eat well, work out and look after yourself, you don’t have to be fat and flabby at .*Note to self – eat better and go to the gym. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was a great manipulator but I never saw that at the time.“I’m thankful he’s been jailed and the world can see him as the monster he truly is.”Lisas nightmare began in  when she met Gorringe in a supermarket while shopping with her mum.As a friendship between the three blossomed, Lisa and her mum would go for dinner at his home and he offered to tutor her once a week in what the court heard was the systematic corruption of a child.We really thought we could trust him but I realise that this was the start of his trap, Lisa said.By December , Gorringes behaviour turned sinister and he touched the teen in a park one night leaving Lisa frozen in fear.He then began abusing Lisa a couple of times a week and bought her a phone so they could message in private.Then, in January , Gorringe raped Lisa at his home.She says: “The pain was unbearable. I just wanted it to be over, so I stayed quiet.“But, after that, Anthony raped me whenever we were alone together.“I felt so alone and would cry in my room for hours. He never threatened me but I wouldn’t dare tell anyone.”Gorringe would regularly rape Lisa and demand she sleep with his friends - with the teen too terried to refuse.One day, he introduced her to his mechanic Barry Gaynor and forced Lisa to have sex with him as payment for a car he fixed.Trapped Lisa had no choice but to go along with what her evil abuser wanted - and she even moved in with him in  when she was  as she had nowhere  to go.Despite cops arresting Gorringe after allegations were made against him by someone , the beast stepped up his campaign of abuse and even took naked pictures of Lisa.Officers discovered the images on his seized laptop and Gorringe admitted seven counts of taking indecent photographs of a child and one count of possession of indecent photographs of a child.He was caged for eight years but Lisa was still too terried to tell police about her four-year hell at the hands of Gorringe.It was only when she met her husband in  and became a mum that she finally plucked up the courage to open up about her suffering.She said: Despite everything he’d put me through, I felt like Anthony was the only person I had left so I couldn’t tell the police about the rapes.Becoming a mother made me realise the impact of Anthony’s abuse. I knew he couldn’t get away with what he’d done to me.Gorringe was convicted of a total of  sex offences, including three counts of rape against Lisa and two against a teen boy - and one count of causing child prostitution.He was jailed for  years, with an eight-year licence extension. It means that he can be recalled to prison on his release up to the age of . Gaynor was jailed for six years for rape.Sentencing, Recorder Stephen Lennard described Gorringe as a dangerous offender.He said: You are a predatory and manipulative sexual deviant who stopped at nothing to obtain what you wanted.Lisa is now trying to move on with her le and hopes by speaking out, she can inspire other victims to do the same.She said: “It was a relief. Anthony picked me out at the supermarket, groomed, assaulted and exploited me.“He’s a monster. Now I’m trying to move on with my le.“I just hope that my story gives others the courage to speak out.

We need another show with a big house and a strong, silent, topless gardener who gallops around searching for love, fulfilment and all that toss.”So we’ve now got this six-part series fronted by Tom Bateman, who actually made a promising start to playing soldier-turned-trader John Beecham.He got shot.I’d have run the closing titles right there and then and promised viewers: “ITV willin about , when it’s got some new ideas.”According to the caption, however, “three years later” John Beecham was back and he’d brought his extended family with him to fill the big house.They include: His dear old racist mum, played by Mrs Patmore off Downton, a motherless baby, wayward brother Daniel, some pot-stirring French git called General Castillion and two underwhelming bits of female love interest, who won’t get any bloke switching over from Love Island in a hurry. Also present is Citizen Khan himself, Adil Ray, who’s moved in next door wearing a glued-on beard that last saw serious action in Carry On Up The Khyber.So I hope no one was expecting a laugh, or a plot. Because Beecham House hasn’t really got one, apart from the baby issue and Beecham’s grovelling desire to be granted a trading licence, which both generate lots of sarky backchat from the locals, but not much .It all stands or falls then, almost entirely, on the leading character.And, oh boy, does this one ever fall.As absolutely everyone’s noticed, for the want of charisma they’ve had to dress the poor bloke up as Indiana Jones, which can’t be a lot of fun in that climate.Even with the overcoat, cowboy hat and women throwing themselves at him, John’s brother still thinks he’s “the dullest man in Delhi”.The thing that really weighs him down, though, is Empire guilt. The righteous berk can hardly look at an Indian without apologising.“Your Imperial Highness, I implore you judge me by my actions not my flag.”“I am not like my countrymen.” “Their hypocrisy sickens me.” “The East India company’s policy of expansion is shameful.” “I love your country and believe India should be ruled by Indians.”  He’s so woke he could be reading last night’s Channel  News.An approach that’s unlikely to win the show many friends, I’d have thought, or stop the more right-on viewers accusing him of having “big white saviour syndrome”.Ultimately, though, I have absolutely no real idea whether John Beecham will strike a chord with the viewers, because, like most shows broadcast in the Sunday night pm to pm slot, I am not part of the target female audience.All I’m meant to do is sit dumbly and join in the apologetic Empire chorus.I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m not sorry at all.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “In Only Fools And Horses, who plays the character known as Del Boy ”Ben: “David Frost.”Fteen To One, Sandi Toksvig: “What is the two-word term for a flashing orange globe mounted on a striped pole, used at pedestrian crossings, named after a s minister of transport ”Kresha: “Traffic light.”And Love Island, Molly-Mae: “What is the capital of France ”PSYCHOPATH With Piers Morganrequires expectations to be managed, because it’s barely a minute old when Porky-Talkie reveals: “The prison considers Paris Bennett so dangerous they insist I interview him behind toughened glass.”Andthat’s not health-and-safety gone mad, I dunno what is, frankly.RE: Love Island. If Joe and Lucie were “Jucie” and Jordan and Anna “Jordanna”, did that make Elma and Scottish Anton “Elma Fud” NEVER a good sign when you can tell a show’s going to be a disaster just from the furniture.But that was the case with last Tuesday’s big political bun fight, on BBC, which looked more like a dating show or fire sale at Louis Walsh’s gaff than a debate to decide Our Next Prime Minister.It sounded like it as well, from the way host Emily Maitlis kicked off, barking: “Five men. One job.” A phrase I don’t think I’ve heard any presenter utter since Kerry Katona was fronting ElimiDate, back in .Long before it got to air, Maitlis and the BBC had also clearly decided Boris was the “Islamo- phobic” booby prize, because not one of the researchers saw any warning signs being given off by Abdullah, from Bristol, who’d deactivated his Twitter before appearing on the show. The prize guy, naturally, was meant to be Rory Stewart, who liberal political commentators all think would make a great Conservative Party leader, in the same way they probably think Iggy Pop would make a great lead singer of One Direction.Turned out, though, he’s a fidgeting little oddball who was political toast long before he sighed at Boris: “I’m sure, like me, you’ve been in Enniskillen sitting with sheep farmers.”So, by the end of the night, an attempted BBC stitch-up had accounted for: Rory Stewart, one anti-semite, from Bristol, some other bug-eyed Corbyn cultist demanding an early election and probably Emily Maitlis’ credibility as well.Boris, meanwhile, just ploughed on regardless.Well done, everyone.Celebrity Crystal Maze, Gemma Collins: “Just being honest, it’s an honour for you to have me.”And The Last Leg, Alex Brooker: “The problem with me swimming The Channel is I can’t swim.”Problem how ON Thursday’s Shopping With Keith Lemon, former market trader Rob Beckett claimed: “I used to sell compost and you can’t up-sell a bag of s***, can you ”Yet it never stopped him trying on All Together Now.IT’S nearly six months since that great foghorning orca, Gemma Collins, last made an exhibition of herself on television.So I suppose we were overdue Friday’s appearance on Celebrity Crystal Maze, where she rumbled round the course, like Indiana Jones’ concrete ball, alongside Carol Vorderman, Ellie Taylor, Rick Edwards and her on off boyfriend Arg.And how that pair avoided wedging themselves inside one of the show’s duct shafts will remain for ever one of the Channel  show’s great mysteries.Gemma bellowed over everyone, insulted her co-stars, threw a hissy fit inside one virtual reality game – “Nah, sorry. Stop the game” – and told host Richard Ayoade: “You must be clever ’cos I’ve got the mind of a genius and you’ve made me laugh.” She also attempted to create some sort of mystique around “The GC” tag, claiming it was nothing to do with her initials and inviting alternative suggestions from Carol, who remained diplomatically silent, evenI’d swear you could see in the thought bubble above her head  . . . “Gigantic consonant vowel consonant consonant.”THE Real Chernobyl proving the perfect accompaniment to Sky Atlantic’s show of the year.Susanna Reid’s digestive tract going into deep spasm when Geoffrey Boycott asked her out for lunch, on another unmissable Good Morning Britain.Top Gear’s Chris Harris attempting to drink a glass of water while being electric-shocked by Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness.And Alien Fun Capsule host Harry Hill responding to Stephanie Beacham name-dropping former Dynasty husband Charlton Heston: “Yeah, Charlton Heston. He was slumming it a bit after Ben Hur, wasn’t he ”ITV has just one brilliant comedy show. Harry Hill’s Alien Fun Capsule, co-written by Paul Hawksbee and Dan Maier.Slightly to my surprise, I’ve learned it also has a Head of Comedy called Saskia Schuster, who’s just told something called the Diverse Festival – and what a laugh riot that sounds – she will no longer commission shows written only by men.In the great sweep of ITV history, the possibility exists, of course, that someone has made a more stupid, pointless, self-defeating, virtue-clogged, brain-fart of a commitment than this one.It’s just that I can’t think of it at the moment.LAURA Bassett: “She had her arms by her side behind her body.”Casey Stoney: “Cameroon have got that no-lose attitude, eventhey lose.”Jordan Nobbs: “If England keep believing, the second half will come.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Resign!” were directed at the homelessness minister Heather Wheeler.In an email written before she took up the role, Wheeler described rough sleepers in her constituency as “the traditional type, old tinkers”.The words were leaked and, lo, the outrage flowed hot and predictable. The Big Issue Foundation’s chief executive raged that such language, “has no place in this day and age” and so Wheeler should stand down.A travellers’ charity called her words “racist”, adding that “Irish traveller children should not have to grow up in a society where government ministers show such contempt for their culture”.Yes, Wheeler’s language was wince-worthy, but the leap to “racism” highlights the way race is used as a shield to protect the lestyles of some gypsy, Roma and traveller people from legitimate criticism.Recognised in the Equality Act of  as ethnic minorities, a force field of cultural sensitivity surrounds them. Any discussion of their culture can be labelled racist.Recent reports have found that travellers have it worse than the rest of us: Higher infant and maternal mortality rates higher prevalence of depression higher rates of chronic illness.They are likely to die more than a decade earlier than non-travellers.The educational outcomes for their children are terrible: The lowest attainment of all ethnic groups throughout their school years.They are far more likely to be excluded, and while  per cent of white British children stay in education past , only  per cent of Irish traveller children do.Officialdom’s response to these findings has been to blame officialdom or racial discrimination.The chairwoman of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, Maria Miller, thinks travellers have been “comprehensively failed by policymakers and public services for far too long”.Always, the blame is directed at “the system”.Always, there is the retreat into the safe language of “vulnerable” people and “marginalised communities”, because politicians are terried of asking dficult questions about why travellers are over-represented in prison, or why many of their children are failing at school.Such questions would only spark accusations of racism and discrimination.This is not to suggest that gypsies, Roma and travellers live free from prejudice.There is discrimination which is real and cruel: Allegations of holiday camp operators having traveller blacklists pubs refusing to serve traveller families children bullied in school.Yet whose interests do we servewe pretend that all of this is down to straightforward racism The usually sensible Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has said that for gypsies and travellers: “Great Britain is still like the Deep South for black people in the Fties.”His analogy fails because it suggests the prejudice suffered is all about ethnic heritage, unconnected to the lestyle pursued by many travellers. This is nonsense.Though politicians will not dare say it, many in this country have negative perceptions of these groups because of their experience of illegal encampments on their local playing field: The littering, disruption and what might politely be termed “antisocial behaviour”.They see a group of people refusing to live by the laws the rest of us abide by: Trespassing on land with the police seemingly powerless to stop them breaking locks with no one prepared to arrest them parking on private property and not being towed away.It’s not racism driving this anti-traveller sentiment.It is fury that one community seems to live apart from the rules that govern the rest of us.The authorities seem pitully weak when it comes to evicting these camps. Councils must assess the welfare needs of those on the site before they can get an eviction order.Public money is sprayed on legal fees before the caravans move to a dferent illegal site, where the whole thing starts again.The authorities’ methods might be motivated by a desire not to “marginalise” travellers further, but it isn’t working.We need an approach which, while reconciling travellers’ desire to live on the move, recognises the desire of the rest of us to see the rules of the land enforced fairly.Part of this approach must be to make the process of evicting illegal camps surer and swter.But it’s no use simply wielding this stick without a carrot.The complementary action must be a building programme to create more authorised traveller pitches.Critically, each could have contact points with the local authority, with education and health systems, to catch these families in the net of public services .With more information on who lives where, the authorities could keep better tabs on who is educating their children, who is paying council tax, and so on.This issue may not make the hustings in the Tory leadership campaign, but it matters to the kind of country we are.Sensitivity to dferent cultures is right, butobjectionable or illegal behaviour cannot be dealt with for fear it will look racist, we are in a very strange place indeed.Giving one group a politically correct free pass denied to others is not fair, it is discrimination.Conservatives always talk about the importance of everyone “playing by the same rules”.Here’s a chance for the next leader to show he means it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a sign of the increasingly professional PR operation which Symonds has brought to Boris’ campaign.One of the things which has always endeared Boris to the public has been his refusal to obey the normal rules of public le.Where other politicians go around spouting slogans and with outfits chosen by professional image-makers, Boris has always been happy to appear as his own dishevelled self.His hair is famously a mess and his clothes never quite fit.Where other MPs give the impression as having prepared every word before they speak, Boris has always spoken with flowery language, often throwing in a word or two of Latin.What’s more, he has always been attracted to television cameras like a moth to a lightbulb, never turning down an opportunity to promote himself.But with his letime ambition of being Prime Minister finally on the verge of being realised, it is suddenly a very dferent Boris that we are seeing. Enter: Mr Slick.He has become shy, rationing media appearances to the bare minimum he thinks he can get away with.When he does appear, he is smarter, less rambling and more inclined to speak in prep-prepared phrases.It isn’t hard to spot the new influence in his le.Although only  -  years younger than Boris himself - Carrie Symonds already has a career as PR chief for Conservative Central Office behind her. She now works for Bloomberg.But asher day job weren’t challenging enough, she has an even more important evening and weekend job: tidying up Boris. It is a job she has taken to with great relish.Perhaps stung by Jeremy Hunt’s accusation that he is a coward for avoiding TV debates, Boris had a full day of engagements today – including interviews with LBC and TalkRadio as well as a walkabout in Richmond, West London and tea at the Royal Horticultural Society in Wisley.Besides his tidier appearance – his short hair is now always tucked in - there is a big change in Boris’ body language.While the new Boris gestures with his hands just as enthusiastically as the old one, he has introduced a new gesture – clenched fists – to give the impression of determination.Unlike the old Boris, he managed to sit through a half-hour interview on LBC without once ruffling his hair.He is much more guarded with language. On LBC, host Nick Ferrari questioned him  times on the origin of the photograph of him and Carrie in the Sussex garden.Where the old Boris would have answered the question with humour, now he evaded it altogether, always beginning with the same phrase: “What people really want to know about…”It is a sign that he had been coached specically in how to reply to that question.Gone is the bluffing. Gone is the bumbling. He is no longer winging his way through his interviews – he is sticking to a very carefully-worded script.The closest he came today to courting controversy was to tell TalkRadio that Britain will leave the EU on October  “do or die”.It appeared to be a clear commitment to a No Deal exit on that datehis other plans fall through, something which he has previously avoided saying. The political world should take it seriously – because there are signs he now means everything he says.When talking about his time as Mayor of London, the old Boris would have stuttered and launched into talking about his achievements with great rhetorical flourish.The new Boris, by contrast, has slipped into a habit of other politicians – he ran off a list of statistics which he hoped would present his time at City Hall in good light.Gone is the self-deprecation that was such a trademark of the old Boris. Not once in his appearances over the past couple of days – which included a TV interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg - has he made a joke at his own expense.While the old Boris would have avoided slogans, the new Boris twice used the words “infrastructure, education, technology” – which indicates it is a phrase dreamed up by his campaign team and which he has been instructed to repeat at every opportunity.On Nick Ferrari’s show he made a couple of apologies – one for “the offence I’ve caused” describing niqab-wearers as looking like letterboxes and bank robbers, and one for the government’s social care policies.Boris is no stranger to apology – it was has always been part of his self-deprecating character. But there was an uncharacteristic sincerity in his words.Towards the end of the TalkRadio studio, his careful PR act seemed to be unravelling a bit.He ruffled his hair twice, started rambling that he relaxed in his spare time by making buses from cardboard boxes and couldn’t remember the last sports match he watched other than an England cricket match at which he fell asleep and couldn’t remember who England’s opponents had been.It was a brief glimpse of the old Boris – one which we are unlikely to be seeing much of in futurehe succeeds in achieving his ambition of reaching Downing Street."},{"url":null,"title":"may to stay one extra day","story":"No yesterday confirmed that Mrs May will leave office on the afternoon of Wednesday July .That will be a full  hours after the winner of the Tory leadership contest is announced by Conservative bosses, on the morning of Tuesday July .The revelation came after Mrs May’s officials conferred with the two challengers for her job, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt.As The Sun revealed yesterday, CCHQ also confirmed the ballot of the , Tory party members will close on the preceding Monday evening, with counting of the votes done overnight.The PM’s official spokesman said: “We would expect the transition to the new Prime Minister to take place on the Wednesday afternoon, after Prime Minister’s Questions”.That date means Mrs May will have served three years and  days as Premier, making her the rd longest of the  Prime Ministers that Britain has had.Tomorrow she will overtake ’s PM Neville Chamberlain, who served two years and  days.But Mrs May won’t now overhaul s leader James Callaghan, who had three years and  days in power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

as well as the use of cannabis products in electronic cigarettes and e-liquids.Laws state consumption of the class B drug is okay as long as youre over , purchasing the cannabis from a state licensed seller and consuming it in the appropriate places - that means on private property, mostly and not in any parks, bars, restaurants or beaches. According to Dr Stanton Glantz, who is a professor of medicine at the University of Calornia San Francisco Centre for Tobacco Control and Research, e-cigarettes are associated with heart attacks, strokes and lung disease.Glantz, a supporter of the ban admitted that in his opinion, electronic cigarettes shouldnt even be on the market.Young people have almost indiscriminate access to [e-cigarettes] he said, and claims that the use of them has completely reversed the progress weve made in youth smoking in the last few years.The doctor said that due to inaction on the matter from the American Food and Drug Administration , its unfortunately falling to states and localities to step into the breach.In a statement to the Associated Press, FDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum said the agency will continue to tackle the troubling epidemic of e-cigarette use among kids.This includes preventing youth access to, and appeal of, flavoured tobacco products like e-cigarettes and cigars, taking action against manufacturers and retailers who illegally market or sell these products to minors, and educating youth about the dangers of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products, he said.But electronic cigarette company Juul, whose headquarters are in the city, oppose the ban - having framed the use of electronic cigarettes as a healthier alternative to traditional smoking tobacco.Juul say they have taken steps to deter children from using their products, describing their online age verication process, which requires e-cig users to enter their date of birth, legal name and permanent address into an age verication form, which is then checked as more robust.They have also shut down their Facebook and Instagram accounts to deter youngsters.Speaking out against the ban, Juul spokesperson Ted Kwong said the prohibition of vapour products for all adults in San Francisco will not effectively address underage use and will leave cigarettes on shelves as the only choice for adult smokers, even though they kill , Calornians every year.The American Vaping Association, like Juul say that the ban deprives adult smokers of less hazardous alternatives, going after youth is a step that you can take before taking these out of the hands of adults, said association president Gregory Conley.The e-cig ban follows a ban on the sale of flavoured tobacco last year, and a tax on sugar sweetened drinks in .However, San Fransisco celebrates its marijuana culture with one journalist describing the city as a hub for world-class cannabis in the same way the city is a meeting place and a destination for top-flight food, wine, and technology.Opposers to the ban also site the effect it will have on small businesses, saying that it could force some shops - who rely on the sale of e-cigs - to close.We need to enforce the rules that we have in place already, said Carlos Solórzano, CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco.San Franciscos mayor, London Breed, has  days to sign off the legislation, but has indicated that she would.

Itaposs worth noting Theresa May is not attending the national event in Salisbury either because she will be at the G summit in Japan. So before you see people talking about it, what are Jeremy Corbynaposs plans and what is the event  Hereaposs an explanation.  Armed Forces Day began in  after then-Chancellor Gordon Brown launched a aposVeterans Dayapos to celebrate the armed forces. It was given its current title in  and is now held on the last Saturday of June every year. There are hundreds of local events across the country, and each year one town or city hosts a aposNational Eventapos. In  the city is Salisbury, which then-Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson chose partly due to the bravery, dedication and skill tackling a nerve agent attack by Russian agents. The national event will include a military parade on Saturday morning, fireworks and a Kaiser Chiefs gig in the evening, and a world record attempt for the largest human poppy on Sunday.  The Mirror understands Jeremy Corbyn is once again not planning to attend the national event in Salisbury this weekend.Instead Labour sources said he intends to attend one of more than  local armed forces events near his London home.Further details of the event were not immediately available but it is understood it is an Armed Forces Day local event in Islington.

In  Labour said he instead planned to attend a march to mark  years of the National Health Service. Is Theresa May attending this year either  No. Neither Theresa May nor Lib Dem leader Vince Cable are attending the national event this Saturday either.That is because Mrs May is instead attending the G summit in Japan. Downing Street have not yet confirmed who will go in her place. A Lib Dem source could not immediately confirm who will go in place of Sir Vince. So is it a apossnubapos  Tory MPs have previously argued - and will doubtless in future - that Mr Corbynaposs decision to attend alternative events for three years is a snub. But supporters will argue that neither the Tory nor the Lib Dem leaders are attending either. And it appears his team are being careful this time to ensure he does pay respects to troops where. Itaposs thought further announcements are in the offing over the coming days to commemorate Armed Forces Day evenhe is not at the national event in person.

Mr Hunt was appearing on Radio aposs Jeremy Vine show when the host described him as the richest man in Cabinet during a discussion about the candidateaposs business past. The Foreign Secretary made a reputed £m when he sold his stake in education firm Hotcourses in . He co-owns an Italian holiday home, an office building in London and a rental empire of seven flats worth a reputed £.million in Southampton. But Mr Hunt, who was earlier today pictured drinking a £. milkshake, did not take the comment well. Mr Vine said: I gather youaposre the richest member of the Cabinet. But Mr Hunt slightly lost his cool after what seemed to be a fairly benign statement. He replied: Hang on.    My salary while I was was running my business was a lot lower than your salary now. Showing deft awareness of his own CV Mr Vine replied: But I am not in Cabinet. But Mr Hunt wasnapost giving up, urging the radio host not to get into the politics of envy. A slightly confused Mr Vine then explained that surely it is a compliment about his often mentioned business background. I was just pointing out that you were a business person who made some money that is all, Mr Vine said. He added: I love the way you immediately think that it is critical. But Mr Hunt replied: No you werenapost. You brought up that fact which may or may not be true - I have no idea . A lot of people would saywe start labelling people like that in a way which says that kind of thing is not a compliment we are not going to be a successful country.    A baffled Mr Vine responded: I am amazed. Mr Hunt finally relented and said thatMr Vine really meant it as a compliment he would take it. Audibly furious Mr Hunt added: Thank you Jeremy for instead of saying I was successful and set up a business and created  jobs that you said I was the richest man in Cabinet. Andthat was meant as a compliment - which I somehow doubt - then thank you for that very generous compliment. Mr Vine replied: Wow. Earlier in the campaign Mr Hunt  - who is the son of an Admiral and a graduate of both prestigious private school Charterhouse and Magdalen College, Oxford - spoke about his daily grind to stay alive as a young entrepreneur. The interview continued with Mr Hunt revealing his passion for the Brazilian dance the Lambada - and over sharing massively.    Mr Hunt - who reportedly has a sprung dancefloor in his home - said that when he was election in  his great passion was lambada dancing. Over sharing, Mr Hunt added: I have to say that this is a dance for single people - it is an intimate dance - so perhaps not one for married listeners. Earlier Mr Hunt spent £ on two milkshakes for the cameras. Sipping the drink from a jar, he said this is some mean milkshake, adding: A big improvement on Nigel Farageaposs milkshake moment. He also bought some white orchids for his we, joking with a market florist: I keep on calling her Japanese when sheaposs actually Chinese - I tell you, I bought a lot of flowers when I did that. An earlier version of this story said Mr Hunt spent £ on a single milkshake. We have since been informed it was £. each on two milkshakes. The Daily Mirror is happy to correct the record.

Legalising assisted dying will for ever be a controversial issue with valid arguments on both sides – but the polling of family doctors by the Royal College of GPs suggests a sea change in public attitudes. Disrespecting the wishes of the terminally ill and pained who yearn for death is challenged when human rights suggest we should all be entitled to end our lives in our own ways. Protecting the vulnerable so money-grabbing relatives don’t bump off loved ones is vital yet that necessity must never be an excuse to force folk to cling on and suffer. Widening the debate and listening to interested parties, including doctors, is heading only one way. Choosing how and when we die should be personal.    Slither off, Boris Twisting and turning like a snake evading the truth, slippery Boris Johnson emphasises with every slimy response that he’s unfit to be Prime Minister. The arrogant incompetent’s humiliating turn after rival Jeremy Hunt forced him to face a few questions was the defensive squirming of a weakling pretending to be strong. Exposure of Johnson’s vacuous Brexit con job and staged photos to cover up a police call to his home are the desperation of a charlatan.    Met Police chief Cressida Dick’s declaration that worried neighbours were right to call cops to the flat he shares with a distressed much younger lover is a warning Carrie Symonds won’t be the only person distressed should Johnson trick his way into Downing Street.

Tragic Darina Shpengler, aged six, has a rare condition that means she has no lips or chin, cannot speak and weighs just lbs.When she was born doctors suggested that her parents give up on her and put her in an orphanage - they refused - and she was shunned by extended family members.Other children are scared of the girl due to her appearance, and she was not allowed to join a kindergarten back home in Siberia. Her mother Elena, , refused to hide Darina away even though most of her family and friends cruelly “disowned” the girl, forcing her loving parents to move away from their home village.    Soon after her daughter was born, Elena also rejected advice from maternity hospital doctors to quietly give up and forget about the child who would then disappear into Russiaaposs grim orphanage system Elena’s long battle to help her daughter today reaches its climax as she begins potentially le-changing treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. Russian specialists admitted they do not have the expertise to treat the girl and recommended instead the London hospital’s Craniofacial Unit as the best place in the world to help Darina. This week she flew in via Moscow from Krasnoyarsk deep in Siberia. Darina is now under the care of the unit’s head Professor David Dunaway after a major Russian charity Rusfond funded her treatment and expenses to the tune of £,.  Elena dreams that not only will Darina’s face be repaired but that she will be able to eat properly, speak - and smile.“I cannot say how much I am waiting to hear her voice, to hear her saying ‘Mama’. This will be the best melody in the world, to hear her speak,” the emotional mother told The Siberian Times.“My every thought and hope is for the surgery to go well, because it would mean that Darina would be able to eat, and she’ll start gaining weight. “She will start breathing better and hopefully will grow up, and won’t get sick as often as she does now. “She will start playing with other children because they won’t be scared of her.” Though aged six, Darina currently weighs just lbs - the same as many children aged one.  In Russia the girl has had no final diagnosis but she is suspected to suffer from debilitating Nager syndrome. While Darina cannot speak she senses that she is shunned by potential friends, as well as adults. “I want people to stop pointing fingers at her so she doesn’t feel unhappy,” said Elena, who gave up work to care for her child full-time. “Darina is now old enough to understand everything.” She said: “Darina cannot express her feelings with words, but I can see that just like me she is excited to see the doctor . “Like any mother of a child with such a long illness history I am nervous of what tomorrow brings, but also I am incredibly grateful to everyone who helped us get this far. “I never thought it would be possible to see an expert of the level of Professor Dunaway, and I firmly believe in the surgery’s success.”  Recalling the hardships they have been through, Elena said: Darina does not have lips. Her mouth is constantly open and all the time in blood. Only my sister supported me. All other relatives just stopped any communication with us. My brothers, their children, my husbandaposs mother - nobody wanted to accept Darina.” Three years ago in an interview she explained her philosophy but also the agony she has faced. She said: We do not hide Darina from people. We take her everywhere with us. Can you imagine, we go into the shop, see our own relatives, and they immediately go out, asking their children not to look at us  Worse, she said, their relatives even informed police she and her husband Yury - now  - had damaged Darinaaposs mouth themselves.  She added: I got a call from the police. They demanded explanations. Our surgeons were shocked to hear all this. And we need all our powers to help Darina. We need to raise and support her, she has a lot to overcome. One of her Russian surgeons, Orest Topolnitsky, who previously operated on Darina, said: We know that this family has problems with relatives who have not loved this girl from the very beginning. Some people have no hearts, it is so shocking. Elena said that when she gave birth the medical staff initially refused to show her the child. She recalled: I begged them to to show me my daughter. The nurse looked at me and asked - aposAre you ready to see it  She is in an incubatorapos. I went close and looked - and saw this wide open mouth. I fell into darkness - and lost consciousness. I was taken to intensive care where the doctors suggested I leave the baby in the hospital. But I strongly refused.  Yury, her husband, was recovering from a car crash in another hospital. When he finally saw the baby he was adamant. His face did not change when he saw Darina, she said. He told his we: She is ours, our girl. The truth is this trouble has only brought us together, she said. It is so horrible when you see a crippled and crying baby and you are unable to help. Darina was crying day and night, and I was crying too. I understood that she was in pain.” Elena added: People told us to put a mask on her butreplied: aposIf you donapost want, donapost look at her - but we accept her the way she isapos. Darina was not allowed to join a kindergarten. We were told that the other children would be scared. Instead, social services sent two teachers to come to Darina once a week. She is such a sociable girl. “We have bought lots of toys for her but nothing can replace friends. Darina likes to sing - making melodies even though she cannot pronounce words. She loves to put on clothes and look at herself in the mirror, her mother added.

Emma Bunn, , first developed the habit as a baby, but despite repeated attempts to stop she continues to wake upshe loses it during the night. She revealed that nurses tried to take the blanket away from her fearing it was a health hazard when she took it into hospital - so she hid it. One comfort blanket that she first got as a child she slept with into her s until it was aposmankyapos with holes in and virtually aposdisintegratedapos is now being kept safely in a drawer. The mum from Lowestoft in Suffolk said: It is embarrassing for me because obviously I am a bit old to be doing stuff like that, but I canapost sleep without it no matter how much I try. I think I will always have a Cuski or equivalent. I donapost think thereaposs a Cuski rehab I can go to. The first blanket I had when I was little was a big blue blanket with a lamb and a ribbon around the edge. I basically slept with it until it wore away [aged ]. Then I had what was like a bit of terry-towelling or sweatshirt fabric, which wore away and wore away. I kept cutting it down until I ended up with a strip about a foot long and an inch and a half wide, which got more and more manky. Iaposve still got that little bit left.    Ms Bunn read an article about soft fabric toys geared at newborns named aposcuskisapos and instantly fell in love, now being unable to sleep without her baby blanket near her. She keeps one blanket at her home, one at her fianceaposs house - and even has one for aposemergenciesapos in her living room along with a special apostravel-sizedapos fabric square she takes on holiday. Ms Bunn has been recognised by Cuski as the oldest Cuski user in the world after posting a picture of herself with the beloved bedtime item online. She said: It must have been about  years ago I saw these things online called Cuskis. They look like a little flat ghost and are really cute. I bought one which I still sleep with, and a second one which I keep at my fianceaposs house, and a third which is like a little rabbit which I keep in the lounge in case of emergencies. Heaposs called aposBedtime Bunnyapos. I also have a little square of fabric which I take away with me on holiday and my partner gets quite embarrassed. A couple of times I have left it in the bed when the maid has come to chase the bedclothes and the maid had taken it away. Iaposve had to chase her to get it back. Iaposve taken them into hospital and when I was in hospital the nurses want to take it away from me because they say itaposs so manky itaposs a health hazard. They werenapost taking it - I hid it. Iaposve done it for years and I have tried to give it up. Obviously Iaposm  and itaposs a bit old to be doing that. But evenI lose it in the night I wake up.    She believes the blanket became a habit when she was a child - and now she associates the blanket with a good night of sleep. Her long-term partner, who wished to remain anonymous, initially struggled to accept the blanket in their bed but now only jokingly shows his disdain by placing the Cuski half hanging out of the bin. Ms Bunn, who works in rehoming homeless people, said: I think itaposs just how I learned to sleep when I was a little girl. I still sleep with the radio on very quietly too because my parents used to leave the radio on in my bedroom. I still do that. Itaposs so quiet that you can barely hear it but it works like white noise for me. I tried to encourage my son when he was a little baby to have a blankie but he wasnapost interested. I used to say, aposhereaposs your blankieapos but he just wasnapost into it. I think itaposs lovely. My partner originally hated it and thought it was ridiculous, but then he realised thatI didnapost have it I couldnapost sleep. Sometimes he will do mean things with it like hang it half in and out of the bin and send me a photograph. Or heaposll suspend it by one leg from somewhere. I always thought it was funny. I personally know having a blanket is daft - Iaposm not naive. Itaposs just a silly thing for me and I canapost sleep without it.    The mum revealed that she has tried to give up her safety blanket but says that she canapost. Ms Bunn said: I have tried to give up but it doesnapost work. I just donapost sleep. I usually give it a few days before I give up giving up. I donapost knowthis is true, but my partner reckons thatI havenapost got it then I snore. I think heaposs just pulling my leg. I donapost think itaposs true - I think he might be winding me up. Itaposs just what youaposre trained to like. Dferent people are trained to like dferent types of pillows, other people like covers or duvets. Some people sleep with their feet in and some with their feet out. Itaposs all stuff weaposve done from being a child but when you grow up into being an adult you bring it with you and canapost shake it. Maybe I am making it too easy on myself by not trying hard enough to give it up. But itaposs not causing anyone any harm, and itaposs comforting for me. I even have a t-shirt that someone bought me which says, aposwhereaposs your blankie when you need it apos A spokesperson for Cuski said: Thank you to Emma for this fabulous update on her Cuski comforters helping her to sleep. We can now categorically say we help neonates, full-term babies, toddlers, teens and adults sleep comfortably through the night. Emmaaposs story has made the Cuski team feel very warm inside and given us all a chuckle. Cuski Baby supplies the NHS with Cuski Miniboos for neonates and full-sized Cuskis like Emmaaposs for babies and toddlers that unfortunately are in hospital as the Cuski comforter helps soothe through familiar scents.

The controversial new rules at The Hen and Chicken Pub in Bristol appeared on a laminated poster on the pubaposs notice board behind the bar. They apply to all children and teenagers under the age of . The new restrictions state that children must be sat at a table with an adult at all times, whether dining or not, and prohibits free roaming, running, scootering, or climbing. The notice adds that children under the age of  are not allowed on the premises after pm, while children aged - can only stay on the premises after pm when having a meal. It furthers asks parents to be mindful to prevent children shouting or screaming. The Bedminister pub has mixed responses, with some parents championing the pub for being upfront, while others brand it ridiculous.     Pub director James Townend has said he implemented this policy has been in place for more than five years, but that it is going to be more strictly enforced in future. The poster in full reads: Please be aware that as part of out licensing commitment to the safeguarding of children and minors: Children under the age of  are not permitted on the presmises after pm. Children between the ages of    years are only permitted on the premises after pm when having a meal, accompanied by an adult and must depart by pm. - year olds are not permitted on the premises after pm unless attending a performance upstairs and accompanied by an adult. In consideration of all our customers, we do insist that: All children must be sat at a table with an adult at all times, whether dining or not  inside or outside. No free roaming, running, scootering or climbing. Please be mindful to prevent children shouting or screaming. Thank you for your understanding and consideration to our staff and all our customers.    Mr Townend who has been the pub director for a decade said: This is not simply a knee-jerk reaction. As a dad to three sons, I completely understand it can be hard work keeping your children sat down at the pub. Sadly there are a minority of parents who think itaposs okay to relinquish control of their parental responsibilities as soon as they enter the pub, and think itaposs okay for their children to run around screaming and shouting. There are places where children are free to do this such as parks and playgrounds. But when you enter a pub, which has always been seen as an adult domain, there is a responsibility to conform a little bit. We have customers who want to enjoy a nice pint or meal after work without people running around shouting. He also said the new rules can prevent dangers.    Mr Townend said: Letaposs not forget it can also be hazardous. I once picked up a baby who was stood very close to the kitchenaposs swinging door. If I hadnapost have done that, the door could easily swung open and knocked her over. We donapost take steps like this lightly but the issue has been getting worse recently so we felt like something needed to be done. Thereaposs a reasonable level of behaviour we expect from all of our customers regardless of their age. He added that staff have been told to let parents know about the newly enforced rules when they enter, so they can make an informed decision as to whether they would like to stay or go where. He stressed children are still very much welcome in the pub, providing they abide by the rules, adding that the Hen and Chicken is still an important part of the local community. Mum-of-one Jojo Carpenter supports the pubaposs decision. The -year-old said: I think this is absolutely fair enough. Theyaposre basically saying that itaposs really a pub for adults and thataposs fine, I just wouldnapost take my child there. I actually prefer it when establishments are clear and this sign is very clear. Thereaposs nothing worse than walking into a pub with kids and feeling unwelcome, despite the fact there are kidsapos menus on the tables. I would much rather places are upfront like this.    But there are also parents who believe the pub is acting unreasonably. Mum-of-two Emma Grimshaw said: I think the thing about the hours is fair enough but the rest is just totally unrealistic. Thereaposs no way you can get a child to sit down for the whole time, putting that pressure on parents is unfair. How many adults sit down the whole time theyaposre there  And also, did the owners sit still when they were kids  I bet they didnapost. Either ban kids entirely or let kids be kids, they canapost make up ridiculous rules like this. Also letaposs not forget kids arenapost the only ones who are noisy in pubs - students, stag dos and birthday parties all give them a good run for their money. Local pubs cafes and restaurants are meant to be for the whole community, but these new rules goes against that.On Facebook , Natasha Shaddick also shared her disapproval writing: Glad Iaposm not the only one pretty shocked by this!!

The LSEaposs Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment today released its prediction, in a bid to warn Brits to take precautions ahead of the scorcher of a weekend. The instituteaposs number-crunchers have based the grim figure on data charting heatwave-related deaths reported by public health authorities previously.    Despite wet and thundery conditions set to affect much of England imminently, the Met Office has issued a danger heath health alert warning conditions will turn sharply later in the week, which can have dire consequences for vulnerable people such as the elderly.The research instituteaposs analysis refers to official figures published by Public Health Englandpreviously, which show that , deaths across England were linked to summer hot weather over the past three years.During the devastating summer  heatwave, authorities recorded more than , excess deaths over ten sweltering August days. PHE has over previous years warned that hot weather is related to at least , deaths every year in England.    Parts of Europe are also on alert as scientist are warning more potentially deadly heatwaves are in store thanks to warm air from Africa set to settle in later this week.The record-breaking extreme temperatures are being predicted to soar higher than C in parts of Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium this week.The Grantham Research Institutesaposs analysts say these deaths are preventable - urging Britons vulnerable in the heat to take precautions based on this weekendaposs weather forecast. What the experts say Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: “With daytime temperatures forecast to be close to  degrees Celsius by the end of the week, there could be many deaths, particularly among vulnerable groups, such as those suffering from serious respiratory illnesses. Based on experience of the past three summers, during which over  extra deaths occurred during bouts of hot weather, more than  deaths could be expected over the weekend. “Many of these deaths are preventableextra precautions are taken to protect those most at risk from overheating in their homes and other buildings, both during the day and at night.    The Met Office and Public Health England have already issued a Level  Heat Health Alert to warn people of the potential dangers. “We know from research by the Met Office that the frequency of summer heatwaves and hot weather conditions has been increasing because of climate change. Last summer was the second warmest on record for the UK, and Met Office researchers have estimated that it was made  times more likely by climate change. The UK’s  warmest years have all occurred since .” What you can do to ward off dangerous heat   Mr Ward said while British authorities had become better at managing hot weather risks since the events of the deadly  heatwave, more could still be done. He recommended Brits adapt homes for summertime heat, including by installing air conditioners and attaching external windows. He also urged authorities to introduce measures to prevent overheating, including regulations to ensure homes and workplaces were constructed to ward off overheating in hot weather. “Those who live and work in London and other cities are particularly exposed to the risks of heatwaves because the surfaces of roads and buildings tend to absorb more sunlight and convert it into heat compared with surrounding countryside, he added. London Climate Action Week, beginning on July , will highlight the impacts of climate change like more frequent heatwaves which create increased risk from hot weather for people who live and work in the capital.    How hot is it forecast to get this weekend  Temperatures are expected to climb as high as C this weekend as the heatwave spreading over parts of Europe makes itself felt in Britain. An enormous reservoir of warm air that has triggered emergency measures in France is due to send the mercury shooting skywards, with temperatures peaking on Saturday. Highs of C could be seen for eastern parts as far north as Yorkshire, while temperatures will be in the upper s for revellers at the Glastonbury Festival. Western parts are expected to see the better weather on Friday, while the picture will switch around on Saturday. Met Office forecaster Matthew Box said: We are looking at  or  degrees, perhaps peaking at  here or there on Friday and that will be across western or south-western parts of the UK.    Then we could see  or  across eastern areas of England London and the Home Counties through Lincolnshire and parts of Yorkshire, on Saturday. The blast of warm weather has led some meteorologists to predict new June records will be set in France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium in the coming days. France has been bracing for the heatwave, with temporary fountains put in place and plans for public pools to stay open for longer, amid forecasts suggesting temperatures could exceed C this week. The hot spell is set to be relatively short-lived in the UK, with unsettled weather moving in from the Atlantic on Sunday. PHE has been approached for comment.

Louise, from Newcastle, said: I was looking for work recently and struggling to find a job, so I cast a spell by burning a green candle, symbolic of prosperity, doused in frankincense, signying wealth. The very next day, I got a message on the jobseekersapos site LinkedIn from someone offering me the job I have now working in a clothing shop. So, I find spells very helpful sometimes.    Using a wand and a cauldron to perform spells Louise claims her magical powers also helped a friend to get over a relationship ending. She said: I recently helped my friend, whoaposd been heartbroken when she split with her boyfriend, by casting a spell during the new moon. I used my wand to begin the spell and lit a yellow candle - which I had made in my cauldron from wax and sandalwood - that signies happiness. Then I took a photo of my friend and her ex-boyfriend and cut it in half, placing the half with her in it next to the candle. About a week later she was going out with someone .    But Louise insists she only uses her magic as a force for good and the practising pagan wants to dispel misconceptions that it is a force for evil. She said: Lots of people, when the hear the word aposwitchapos think of devil worship, which is very far from the truth as the devil is a Christian concept. I became a witch because I feel a close link to nature and paganism is a religion which stresses the importance of the natural world. But the misconception of witches being old women with black hats and boils on their noses is still very prevalent, and thataposs something I want to push back against. Louise, whose boyfriend Ben Knibbs, , a bartender, is not a pagan but supports her beliefs, says she introduced some of her more sceptical friends to witchcraft on the  June summer solstice this year.    She invited six friends to join her and write down their wishes on a bay leaf and burn them in the furnace. Louise said: Burning bay leaves is a very common practice among witches and they were really lovely in joining me for the celebration. Afterwards I think they were much more understanding about it. A natural bookworm, Louise, who describes herself as alternative and independent, spent hours in the school library as a child. Despite being raised as a Christian she soon began taking a strong interest in other religions, first delving into Buddhist texts before discovering paganism at the age of .  She said: I have always felt most myself when surrounded by the elements and in the wild, and paganism puts an emphasis on nature. It just seemed to me to be a very peaceful and fulfilling religion. Withcraft, which is a denomination of paganism, has experienced a revival since the s and the publication of Gerard Gardneraposs book High Magicaposs Aid. Louise read book after book on witchcraft and started actively practising when she got the sixth form college. She even built an altar in her bedroom complete with a cauldron, wand, candles, tarot cards and a book of shadows, which she writes her spells in.  The table is the centre piece for her daily aposgratitude chantsapos, during which she gives thanks for what she has in le. Louise also uses it for more signicant rituals observed on the equinoxes and solstices, when she might perform a spell or ination using tarot cards. She explains: Divination is used to seek knowledge of the future and to advise us on certain action to take. And I used tarot cards when I was considering what career to go into. Now an openly practising witch for seven years, Louise occasionally attends pagan festivals such as a May Day gathering in Edinburgh last month. But she mainly prefers working alone and not in a coven. While most people - including her parents, who she does not wish to name - have accepted her beliefs she has had critical comments when posting about witchcraft on her Instagram page.Louise said: I know what people think and it is just frustrating more than anything. Thereaposs a lot of stigma still attached to witchcraft and Iaposm keen to talk openly about it and show people that thereaposs nothing sinister in it. But at the same time, I would never want to ram my beliefs down peopleaposs throats. Everyone should be free to believe what they want and do what helps them make sense of the world. Thataposs what witchcraft does for me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"zara tindall accidentally gives rare","story":"NewsZara Tindall accidentally gives rare glimpse of private area at Windsor CastleThe Royal Family are normally very strict when it comes to their privacy behind closed doors, but Zara Tindall gave people a sneak peek insideShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  JUN NewsZara Tindall looked beautul at Royal Ascot \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhile royal fans are allowed to explore some areas of Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, and Kensington Palace, understandably the familyaposs private living quarters are completely off-limits.

They have been attacked by dogs and even shot at but that hasn’t stopped them posting their takedowns online - where they are fast becoming social media stars. They share a YouTube channel, aposFenrir Recoveryapos, which has amassed over , subscribers, and upload weekly podcasts and bodycam footage of their actions.

One week it’s champagne and the next week, nothing.”  The couple are based out of Hall County in Georgia, which is known as aposHell Countyapos due to the high crime rate compared to other counties, and have now worked on over  cases stretching across the US.

I loved it right away.”    Alex, who grew up in Georgia in a traditional Southern home, said: I wanted to be a bounty hunter from the age of  but it seemed like a movie job and not an actual career path so right out of high school I became a freelance photographer. “Then when I was  years old I started looking into investigations work and I met Jon at a Krav Maga class.

The man, named only as Alexander, was found by hunting dogs roughly one month after he was overpowered by the predator in Russia’s remote Tuva region, it has been claimed. The emaciated man was rushed to hospital where he was diagnosed with a broken spine from his fight with the brown bear, say reports. He told doctors a large predator had overpowered him.    “The bear preserved me as food for later,” he is reported to have said. The footage has not been independently veried by the Mirror. He drank his own urine to survive, he said. Medics say it is a “miracle” that he is alive. A group of Russian hunters claim to have found Alexander after their dogs barked and refused to move on from a bear den they passed in the forest in mountainous Tuva. The region is favoured by Vladimir Putin for vacations.    The hunters checked inside the lair and saw what they believed was a human mummy - until they released he was alive. “The man remembers his first name but not his age and was reportedly in the den for around one month - drinking urine to survive,” reported The Siberian Times. A hospital video shows the bearded man opening his blue eyes and confirming his first name. He was described as having “severe injuries and rotting tissue” from lying motionless for so long in the den. “Local medics say they cannot explain how the man survived such injuries,” said the report.  The exact location where he was found has not been revealed, nor the name of the hospital where he was treated. A spokesman at the health ministry in Tuva Republic, a region in southern Siberia, said: “We cannot confirm the case happened in Tuva. “It was not registered by the Ministry of Health, the Emergencies Ministry or any other official body . “Most probably, it happened somewhere outside Tuva.” The man was spoken to by medical staff in Russian rather than the local Tuvan language. Brown bears are known to hide their prey andto feast on it later.

Donapost bother, was Jacinda Ardernaposs message to the child murderer when a local news conference touched on the reports British officials were looking to potentially relocate him to New Zealand. New Zealandaposs immigration department had not received any applications from Venables, she told media. Of course, because of his existing convictions he would need an exemption... my advice would be aposdonapost bother applyingapos. Venables and accomplice Robert Thompson murdered toddler James Bulger  years ago when they were both just  years old, in a case that horried Britain. The UKaposs Ministry of Justice has repeatedly declined to comment on claims in the Daily Star of an apparent official bid to relocate Venables to Canada, Australia, or New Zealand.  But the Commonwealth countries have made it clear they will not be laying out welcome mats for the notorious killer. The report claimed authorities grappling with the challenge of keeping Venablesapos identity under wraps believe paying for the killer to move to one of the three countries - preferably Canada- would be cheaper than funding more failed new starts in the UK. Venables, now , was granted letime anonymity worldwide after being found guilty of the brutal  murder. He and Thompson snatched two-year-old James from his mum in a Liverpool shopping centre, then tortured and battered him to death on a railway line. Authorities have struggled ever since to keep a lid on the killersapos new identities, fearing they could be subject to violent retributiontheir whereabouts became publicly known.  That struggled has intensied in the social media age, with Venables outed numerous times - including by himself- since he walked free in . Continued rearrangements at protecting his new identities have hit taxpayer coffers hard. The Mirror reported last month Venablesapos latest attempt to keep his identity secret has cost more than £, in public funds, after he beat a court bid by James’s dad Ralph, , to overturn the order. Venables was jailed again in  and  on child abuse image charges. A spokesperson for Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton told local media there had been no visa application from Venables.  When askeda future visa application from the convicted killer would be considered, a spokesperson for the Minister told News they would not comment on a hypothetical situation. Canada has also rejected any prospect of Venables relocating to its shores. According to the National Post, privacy rules prohibit Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada from commenting on inidualaposs cases, but the department pointed out applicants with criminal convictions may not be eligible. An official source told the Canadian news site: “The reality is hewon’t get into the country. At the end of the day, protecting citizens of our country is the foremost thing. He represents a threat to national security.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/GJen_The-Caird4-846x564.jpg ","title":"172 at the caird perfect for our kids free relaxing date","story":"We wanted to have a civilised date night to celebrate the news I am expecting another baby.I fancied something nicer than McDonald’s with the kids or a takeaway pizza on the sofa, before our brood grows by one more. at the Caird is a chic, modern venue in a refurbished former jute mansion on Perth Road – the perfect choice for a calm and child-free evening. vw, px\"  I’d been to the Caird for coffees and drinks in its cocktail and wine bar, so I was aware of the tastefully designed interior and stunning views across the Tay, and I was keen to see how its food matched up.The vibe was certainly calm when we entered the reception and were escorted into an almost empty dining room. vw, px\"  It was a glorious evening and the sun was streaming into the room, so we opted for a table by the large window, perfect for people-watching on the main road, next to the glossy black grand piano – classy.My partner ordered a Rekorderlig ciderand even now I can’t hide the disappointment I feel at not being able to order a cocktail. Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing. We could hear the live musicians in the bar from where we were seating which provided great listening. The staff were also fantastic, extremely helpful, attentive and polite."},{"url":null,"title":"blether rabbie reminisces about game in carnoustie at old westfield park","story":"The Dundee Schoolboys

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack.

These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match. Frequency should be half-hourly.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, backed the station bid.He said: ldquoIt is a good idea, especially with the town expanding as it is.ldquoIt would be a tremendous asset to have.However, the councillor felt it was more likely the station would have to find a new site, such as Alderston, to the north of the town.He added: ldquoIn the short-term it is unrealistic, but hopefully in the longer term things can be put in place to make it a realistic possibility.ldquoIt is a great idea and Irsquom sure it would get support from all the local ward councillors, but where it would go and how much it would cost are questions."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-prestonpans-gala-2019","story":"This year is the th anniversary of Prestonpans Childrenrsquos Gala.On gala day itself, the festivities kick off with the crowning ceremony at am at Prestonpans Community Centre.There is then a fancy-dress competition at Middleshot Square at noon before the parade heads off through the town.From Middleshot Square, it heads along Hawthorn Road and down West Loan to the war memorial, then along High Street before turning up Redburn Road, then along North Grange Avenue, where it ends at Mary Murray Park, behind the community centre.The park hosts the gala dayrsquos family fun, which includes a funfair with a host of rides, as well as old favourites such as hook the duck.There is also a vintage fire engine on display, as well as an American police car, motorbike displays, ponies, birds of prey, beat the goalie, Zorbs, safe archery, NERF guns, crazy golf, a tombola and a gala raffle, not to mention ice cream vans, tea and coffee, Mr Donut Man, crepes, waffles, hot dogs, nachos, a burger van, La Favorita pizzas, stalls selling gts, sweets and cake.Gala day marks the beginning, not the end of Prestonpansrsquo week of fun and activities.Events are as follows:Saturday, June Monday, June Tuesday, June Wednesday, June Thursday, June Friday, June "},{"url":null,"title":"bid-to-turn-former-rbs-in-north-berwick-into-a-house","story":"The townrsquos Royal Bank of Scotlandclosed in June last year.

A photo posted to Twitter shows the prime ministerial hopeful sitting in an oddly empty Heathrow departure gate waiting for a flight to Scotland with the words: \"Just heading to Scotland for day three of campaign. Scotland wants a third runway for Heathrow and so do I!\":Irn-Bru and fish and chips: Jeremy Hunt bids to win over Scottish ToriesScotland collectively furrowed its brow. We... want a third runway  I mean, I cant speak for anyone I know because the topic of Heathrows third runway has absolutely never come up in conversation with friends, not at the dinner table, not at the bar, never in the office. I may, of course, be in the minority of Scotland-dwellers who fail to prioritise money spent on infrastructure  miles away in London.I am, though, certainly in the minority of people I know: I quite like connecting through Heathrow. I have never heard anyone Scottish ever express this preference - they quite emphatically try to avoid Heathrow, in fact.Perhaps the Foreign Secretary has been reading the prophetic, but lesser known, words of the Bard ahead of his trip to Scotland: \"Some hae flight but cannae skite, and some wad skite that want it. If only Heathrow had wan mare runway, we could, to Hunt, be thankit.\"And then, his spectacular misread of voters desires made public, Mr Hunt lands in Peterhead clutching a can of Irn Bru and a fish supper. The scene was obviously staged - there is no way in hell that fish supper would have been safe from swooping North Sea seagulls for more than mere moments. It begs the question, did Hunt have minions with Super Soakers warding off the birds It is the only explanation and one that bursts the myth of him as man of the deep fried dinner people. Yet it gets worse.:Union under greatest strain in living memoryWho, one must ask, advises Westminster politicians that supping Irn Bru will give them an instant in to the Scottish populace Hunt, who said he would, \"Protect the union with every drop of blood in my veins,\" during his visit, is pictured with a can of the fluorescent orange national drink having made mention of a Scottish great-aunt and childhood summers spent in Aberdeenshire.\"You can trust me,\" hes trying to say, with his can aloft, \"I love Jockland. Im just like you. Mmmm, tastes like girders.\" Actually, he described it as \"very pleasant,\" damning with faint praise.Hes not the first. A can of Irn Bru has become a political barometer of cross-border desperation. Forget his weak line on Brexit, it was the beginning of the end for Jeremy Corbyns relationship with Scotland when he was pictured smirking on a train with a bottle of Bru.:Irn-Bru will pay sugar tax on new energy drinkSNP MP Deirdre Brock was quick to criticise his \"silly grin\" and tactless misstep.Boris Johnson, too, has been foiled by a faked preference for Irn Bru. He was pictured in a stage-managed stunt enjoying the luminous elixir from a glass.This was his Scottish downfall. No self-respecting Irn Bru drinker would decant it its straight from the bottle - or can, at a push - but a true Scot would never use a glass.Irn Bru is no plaything, as surely any basic research from an advisor would find out. Whitehouse relations fell to a perilous low when Trump Turnberry banned Irn Bru for its deleterious effect on the resorts carpets.\"We canrsquot have it staining when to replace the ballroom carpet would be pound, alone,\" Turnberryrsquos general manager, Ralph Porciani, said. \"We have villas here with Irn-Bru stains in the carpets which I canrsquot let.This is so obviously fake news as to be painful. Trump himself must leave far more orange smears around the place than any stains created by the tilting glasses of well refreshed guests - think orange soiled towels, bed linen, shirts. Maybe not shirts. Perhaps his fake tan begins at the neck and wrists, the rest of him as peely wally as his Scottish heritage would ensure. Let us not dwell too long upon this thought.Give a Westminster politician an Irn Bru and he will magically assimilate, seems to be the thinking. The Scots will view him, can in hand, as a man of understanding. Sorry chaps.Irn Bru gripped in the mitt of a Westminster politicianwith designs on theScottish vote is nothing but a sign of the enormous disconnect between there and here.

In so doing, she has struck a long-overdue blow for the integrity of art, regardless of how sordid or nasty the person who made it.It is a conundrum audiences, viewers and readers have often had to struggle with. Can you look at a Salvador Dali painting without remembering how cruel he was to his womenfolk, not to mention animals  Enjoy a Maigret novel despite knowing that no housemaid or waitress within reach of Georges Simenonrsquos grasp was safe  Or listen to Wagnerrsquos or Phil Spectorrsquos musical genius without caring about their fascist views or crimes  Once you start, the list of writers, painters, musicians, thespians and all the rest of the creative throng who have lived what you might demurely call ldquochequered lives is never-ending.And yes, itrsquos hard to deny that knowing of someonersquos atrocious acts does stand between us and the art. The creator is always present, becoming part of the experience. But this awareness should deepen rather than detract from the understanding of the piece. As Dench insists, ldquoWe shouldnrsquot judge culture by the morality of its creators. If we did that our walls would be blank, bookshelves half-empty, cinemas and theatres shrouded in darkness. The complex psyches of some artists are plainly the wellspring for their performance. There is even a school of thought that suggests the tormented or immoral activities of such iniduals actively feeds their work.At that point, however, I lose all sympathy. Nobody is above the laws of decency, and everyone knows when they have crossed a line, whether itrsquos criminal or not. The cliche of the tortured artist, allowed free rein to behave as he likes because his genius justies everything, is completely bogus. Effectively it is to argue that an artist is like the Minotaur, a monster whose appetite needs stoking with living prey. Frankly, it is a pathetic excuse, asthe artistic label allows someone a degree of moral leeway forbidden to a decorator or accountant.That, of course, is not what Dench is suggesting. Nor is it the view of any of us who think itrsquos necessary to make the distinction between the artist and what they produce. Whatever the outcome of the case against him, Spacey has been a stellar actor, and to deny that, to write him out of history, is not only wrong but sinister. As viewers we can choose to watch him or not. A director can decide not to employ him, or an actor not to work with him. But letrsquos not be so squeamish we can hardly speak his name, or turn to him on Netflix. When we go down that road, we become like Henry VIII, throwing folk into the Tower for daring to mention Anne Boleyn, whose head he chopped off.As we set up a hue and cry over Boris Johnsonrsquos private le, or that of any politician found fiddling expenses, fathering an extra-marital child or groping a colleague, is there a double standard at play  Nobody would deny that it is acceptable and even praiseworthy to visit an exhibition of the murderer Caravaggiorsquos paintings, or read the adulterer Charles Dickensrsquos novels, or watch the plays of Jean Genet, who was jailed for theft and prostitution. Yet the slightest hint of a misdemeanour among our MPs and MSPs is followed mercilessly, like a pack of hounds catching scent of a fox. Is it not better to treat public figures asthey were Old Masters, judging them by their output, not their ethics If only we could. The problem is, as Boris Johnson knows all too well, in politics the personal is political. Unlike the arts, democracy is founded entirely on trust. Politicians are elevated to power on their promises and their probity. We might worry, with good cause, that this contract has been fatally eroded in recent years, but the principle remains enshrined. If someone is discovered to be violent or unstable, unfaithful, reckless or a liar when behind their own front door, it does not augur well for their professional, public persona. Indeed, the very fact that a prime minister lives with his or her family ndash nominally at least ndash at No. Downing Street, or a First Minister in Bute House, is tacit acknowledgement that for so long as they are in office their entire le is open to public view, and justly so.Nobody in their right mind would have thought to ask Lord Byron to babysit their teenage daughters, but you should have no doubts about the trustworthiness of the PM in that regard. You probably wouldnrsquot have given the notorious scrounger James Joyce the password to your savings accounts, but you know that in Nicola Sturgeonrsquos or Theresa Mayrsquos hands, it would be completely safe. In other words, character and integrity should be evident in everything a politician does.This is not to say itrsquos okay to probe into a politicianrsquos private le asconducting keyhole surgery. Michael Gove and all the others who say they have the right to privacy, and to a pre-parliamentary existence, are correct. To expect our leaders to be saints is plainly ridiculous. But when evidence of corruption or deceit, rank hypocrisy or simply a chaotic home le comes to light ndash as, for instance, when the police are called because of a woman screaming ndash then it matters. It cannot be swept under the carpet. While art comes from the imagination and kicking at convention, running the country demands discipline. It requires decency, truth and, most importantly of all, abiding by the common rules of good behaviour."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10033264.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Iain Macwhirter  Why the SNP could end up deciding the fate of Brexit and the Union","story":"Mr Johnson has been doing a pretty good job of swatting himself recently and his interviews are becoming a serial calamity.

But he is even less likely to win a Commons majority right now.The Queen cant help since she is just a figurehead. It would be for the Speaker, John Bercow, to remind parliament that the only alternative is a general election. MPs will slouch back to their constituencies preparing for a horrendous time from angry voters who are fed up with the lot of them.Both the Tories and Labour realise they are in for a drubbing. The Tories: for failing to deliver Brexit and for wasting three years. Labour: for being hopelessly ided over Brexit and for having a leader whos turned equivocation into a fine art. EvenLabour does a back-flip, and supports a Peoples Vote, it may be too late. This would alienate many Leave voters in Labours  target seats.The people cheering loudest will be the Brexit Party, followed by the SNP and the Lib Dems.

Nicola Sturgeon would surely demand a referendum on independence for Scotland as a precondition for entering any confidence and supply coalition with Labour. ldquoConfidence and supply means that they back Corbyn as Prime Minister, but dont agree to support all his policies. This would be a horrendous situation for the Labour leader.His party is already deeply ided over a possible referendum on Brexit. It would now also be ided over the Union. Many Labour MPs feel as strongly about Scottish independence as they do about Brexit, and many would refuse to consider a referendum on independence, as Ed Miliband did in .For their part, the Conservatives would try to win over the Liberal Democrats. But there is no way, after Nick Cleggs disastrous  coalition with the Cameron Conservativesthat the next leaderwould go down that road. But she is almost as hostile to Scottish independence as to Brexit. Its a double headache for Corbyn.Perhaps a leader of political genius, a Harold Wilson perhaps, would be able to keep the non-Tory ducks in a row, but it seems most unlikely that Jeremy Corbyn would have the personality or the negotiating skills, to cope.

profound importance for Antarctica and the global climate.ldquoWe now know it began around  million years ago.ldquoWe know there was a sudden onset of very strong currents because we can see a phase of pronounced erosion in the deep ocean and the formation of a giant deep-water sand sheet, which was transported and deposited by the current.ldquoThis coincides with the time that major glaciers

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm.

From Shetland to Stranraer and Orkney to Oban, prime properties from all over Scotland will be in the frame.Jo Street, commissioner for BBC Scotland, said: “We’re delighted to announce a second series of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The importance of determining the character, judgement and temperament of the man tipped to be our next prime minister ought to be self-evident. There was a time, I am sure, when it was. But in today’s toxic and corruptive climate, where fundamental concerns for a woman’s welfare and a belief in holding public figures to account are deliberately mischaracterised as politicised acts of aggression, it cannot be stated enough.Mr Johnson has refused to ­comment on whatever series of events led Ms Symonds to reportedly shout, ‘Get off me’, and ‘Get out of my flat’. His silence is unacceptable. It is also intriguing, given his long and inglorious track record of downplaying controversies and exploiting the bumbling self-caricature he has meticulously cultivated. But he is wily enough to know that the less he says on the matter, the more others will talk about it, and so deflect from another scandal looming on the horizon – one which could, and should, threaten to mete out the greatest damage to his ­ruthless ambition. A newly-published video shows Steve Bannon, the far right agitator and former campaign manager to Donald Trump, talking freely of how he helped craft the Commons speechMr Johnson gave when resigning as foreign secretary last year. Its contents ought to prove especially instructive for those who argue the focus of the Tory leadership contest should be on Mr ­Johnson’s policies, as opposed to his personal le. Here is a video where we not only gain an insight into his ideology, but those who claim to be shaping it. In the footage, shot in July last year by US documentary film maker, Alison Klayman and disclosed by the journalist Carole Cadwalladr, Mr Bannon is seen lolling in a London hotel, leafing through a copy of the Dailyand ­discussing how he had a hand in Mr Johnson’s final act as a member of Prime Minister Theresa May’s ­cabinet. “Today we are going to seeBoris Johnson tries to overthrow the ­British government, he’s going to give a speech in the Commons,” Mr Bannon tells the camera. “I’ve been talking to him all weekend about this speech. We went back and forth over the text.”Asked by Ms Klaymanhe and Mr Johnson had been speaking over the phone, Mr Bannon replied: “Talked to him initially over the phone then it’s just easier to go back and forth on text. It’s just easier.”He later says that he had been ­telling the right honourable ­member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip “all weekend” that he ought to “incorporate those themes” he focused on in a June  speech, where he described the day of the EU referendum as Britain’s ­“independence day”. All of which rather sticks a spike in the spokes of the column Mr Johnson wrote for the Dailyin April this year, in which he scoffed at his “so-called association” with Mr Bannon and dismissed it as a “lefty delusion whose spores continue to breed in the Twittersphere”. In the wake of the latest report, a spokesman for Mr Johnson saidthe suggestion he was taking advice from Mr Bannon was “totally ­preposterous”, while Mr Johnson himself said yesterday the idea was “codswallop”. How curious it was, then, to hear Nigel Farage inform a press ­conference that Mr Bannon knows Mr Johnson, and that the two men speak.If anyone knows, he does.In isolation, the video might appear innocuous enough, butyou have either forgotten or are unaware of how Mr Bannon came to occupy such a position of influence, a quick summary follows. Sober profiles of the -year-old bill him as a key proponent of the US president’s economic nationalist agenda. A more precise description of Mr Bannon would frame him as an architect of chaos and ision, whose political appetites will only be sated by the dismantling of the state and, with it, common decency.He is a man who has done more than anything  to legitimise the alt-right movement in the US. This is someone who told a National Front rally that accusations of racism should be worn “as a badge of honour”. He is, in short, a virulent ­presence. The fact that he has the ear of Britain’s prime minister in waiting ought to be of deep concern to the One Nation Tories Mr Johnson ­purports to represent, and the ­public at large. It is, of course, impossible to know just how in thrall Mr Johnson is to him, but it is perhaps telling that around the time of their conversations last year, the former’s feckless bongo thumping rhetoric assumed a darker hue, taking on the slower, steadier drumbeat of populist ­nativism. He compared a Muslim woman wearing a niqab to a “bank robber,” and compared Britain’s negotiating position with the EU over the Irish border to wrapping “a suicide vest around the British ­constitution”.Mr Johnson has shown himself to be extraordinarily proficient in causing upset and unrest in the society he hopes to lead, buthe is receiving directions as he steers a wrecking ball towards Downing Street, the excuses he has relied on so far to maintain an undignied silence just won’t cut it. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"murdo fraser why nicola sturgeon may end up like thatcher","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Thatcher believed her position was unassailable but she was eventually seen as aloof, out of touch and unable to listen # and the same applies to Nicola Sturgeon, writes Murdo Fraser.Watching the ­excellent BBC series The Thatcher Revolution brought back memories for those of us who lived through that turbulent period in British politics. As a Young Conservative in the late s, I knew many of the key players in the latter stages of Margaret Thatcher’s period in office.I can recall making a rather ­precocious speech at the Conservative Party Conference in  on the risks of poll tax implementation, and being cornered that night at the YC dance by the Leaderene herself, who sought me out to ­discuss my views. She did enjoy a good ­argument, as did I. We parted on good terms, but history would prove me right.By that point in her leadership, as this excellent documentary series made clear, Maggie was starting to lose her grip. In office for ten years, after three unprecedented general election victories, she had started to believe that she was invincible and had a monopoly on wisdom. Whilst others might see that it was time for her to move on, there was, in her view, simply no one  capable of doing the job. She was increasingly disengaged from her backbenchers, seen as aloof, out of touch and unprepared to listen. When challenged for the leadership by Michael Heseltine, her team assumed that Conservative MPs would rally to her support. But they were wrong – by this stage it was too late to make up ground, and the Iron Lady was toppled. It is a salutary lesson to all leaders not to lose touch with their footsoldiers. I wonderNicola Sturgeon had time to watch the series, and saw any parallels with her own position. It is becoming a common ­complaint amongst SNP ­backbenchers at Holyrood that the First ­Minister is out of touch. Some are ­positively salivating at the prospect of the upcoming Alex Salmond trial which, they believe, might prove to be a career-ending moment for her. There is open debate about who might replace her as First Minister in that event.There are disagreements within the SNP about tactics for a second independence referendum, with some feeling that the First ­Minister is simply too cautious in her approach. But the issue which has done most to expose the ­disconnect between her leadership and her backbenchers has been the debate around reform of the ­Gender Recognition Act. This seemingly uncontroversial move to simply the process of gender change has become heated and highly ­politicised. A number of women’s group have raised concerns about the conflation of the quite dferent concepts of biological sex and gender identity, which potentially leads to fully male-bodied iniduals accessing women-only spaces. There has been a furious debate, not just on social media, around these issues, with misogynistic slurs such as ‘TERF’ and “cisgender” being thrown around, the feminist icon Germaine Greer being no-ed from universities, women’s meetings picketed, and even allegations that those opposing GRA reforms have been physically assaulted by trans activists.These broader concerns are reflected on the SNP benches at Holyrood, with the MSP Joan McAlpine being a courageous, and outspoken, critic of the pace of reform. She is by no means alone. A signicant group of SNP ­backbenchers feel that their worries about these issues are being ignored by a First Minister whose strong personal commitment to GRA reform means that she is simply not listening to other voices.In last week’s statement made to Parliament on the way forward in this area, there were some signs of softening in the Scottish Government’s stance, with a promise of ­further consultation and consideration of the way forward, in an effort to build wider consensus. But the feeling remains thatconcerned SNP MSPs had not gone public with their criticisms, in some cases risking their careers to do so, then they would have been ignored by an out-of-touch First Minister. It is still not impossible that we could see ministerial resignations on the issue, such is the strength of ­opinion in some quarters.The Alex Salmond situation, the referendum strategy, and the ­gender identity issue, are all areas where there is serious discontent within the SNP with the First Minister’s approach. Despite all her successes, ­Margaret Thatcher found that ­losing touch with her backbenchers was eventually fatal to her leadership.

The truth of the matter is that the erse needs within Scotland need to be accommodated. Within a flexible policy framework based on reality rather than academic theory.The fishing communities of the northeast Scotland have far more in common with their equivalents in the southwest of England than they do with the industrial heartland of the central belt. Similarly that economy has more in common with the west midlands than the remote island communities of the Hebrides.Simply transferring responsibility for Scotland’s immigration to Holyrood as the SNP propose, entirely misses the pointof how a UK wide approach will ensure a positive environment to attract the people our economy needs. We cannot afford to have dferent systems operatingwithin a United Kingdom where people must be able to move freely around within it.: My faith makes me no less Scottish - Stephen Kerr MP That being said the current proposals for a future immigration policy will causereal damage to the UK economy and must be changed.The most obvious problem is that it excludes everyone who earns less than £, a year, classying them as “unskilled”. Some of the most skilled people I know earn less than k . With the average salary in Scotland being just under £, these proposals would wrongly classy the majority of Scots as “unskilled”.That would be a travesty. Nothing could be further from the truth. The people who run our hotels, maintain our national infrastructure and care for our elderly are skilled, they are hard working and they are compassionate.These are the qualities that we want to attract with our immigration policy. A simple salary cut off point is far too blunt an instrument to deal with the problems we have in attracting and retaining talent across the Scottish economy.The Tourism and Hospitality Sector is an excellent example. These businesses need to be able to attracttalented people from around the world.They must have the ability to grow and increase the value that tourism adds to our economy. In my constituency the hotels, tourist attractionsand the outdoor activity sector need staff who have the qualities needed.We must havean immigration policy that works for those businesses.Similarlycompanies needing pharmaceutical lab assistants, food production technicians, moulding engineers, fitters and construction staff, to name just a few, cannot afford to be excluded from accessing the people they need.To label all these people as “unskilled labour” is simply wrong.A top priority for the new Prime minister must be to insist on a flexible and adaptive immigration policy that accommodates the needs of UK business in all of its complex ersity.Whether that be agriculture, tourism, building, Care, manufacturing or any other sector it needs to take account of sectoral needs and move away from a simple earnings thresehold.By yet again focussing on constitutional arguments the SNP continue to let Scotland downand fail to stand up for our interests in the UK.

It is just one of many activities we have planned to celebrate the enormous pride that the people of Northern Ireland have in the achievements of our golfing greats. “While Northern Ireland might one day boast its own ‘Mount Rushmore’ for golf, we can reassure everyone that this stunt is digital theatre and something we hope will raise a smile ahead of July.” Robin Daly, son of the late Fred Daly, said: “Our family are extremely honoured that my father is being remembered in this way.

Lavishly staged by a professional creative team, this stirring Grand Opera House Summer Youth Production is the most ambitious to date, bringing together  of Northern Ireland’s creatives. Supported by a -piece orchestra, the impressive score will feature all the big numbers including I Still Believe, The Movie in my Mind and the iconic The American Dream.-year-old Aquinas pupil Lára Mulgrew will perform the role of Ellen in the stage show. No stranger to the Grand Opera House stage, Lára performed aged nine the role of Molly in their production of Annie. Lára described the audition process “as very straight forward” and how it will be “wonderful” to portray the role of Ellen come July.“I hadn’t seen the production before but was able to watch it on Youtube. It’s going to be a total of six performances and it’s a very mature role,” she said. “It’s definitely the most challenging role I’ve ever had to perform and it will be a great challenge to take on her maturity.”Methody College’s Louis Fitzpatrick will take on the role of American GI John Thomas, part of the battalion deployed in Saigon during the Vietnam War.“I heard about the auditions for Miss Saigon through a friend, I went for one audition and did well enough to get a call back. I was really ecstatic to learn I had got the part as I was performing Footloose at the time as part of the Belfast Youth and Drama Society, I joined in April  and the first production I did was Les Misérables.“I hadn’t watched the stage version before but was able to watch it on Amazon Prime.”The -year-old has just completed his A’levels in Moving Image, Politics and Drama and told the South Belfast News how he hopes to go on to study film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow.Grand Opera House Chief Executive Ian Wilson added: “This is the ninth year that the Grand Opera House has staged its Summer Youth Production, and Miss Saigon® School Edition will be the biggest so far. It’s very rare for a theatre the size of the Grand Opera House to be granted the rights to the youth version, so it really is a brilliant opportunity to see the best up-and-coming musical theatre stars in one of the most popular musicals of all time.”For ticket information visit: www.goh"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"how divine mercy is local turning lives around","story":"FOUNDED in , the Divine Mercy group continues to go from strength to strength.Four years on, the group attracts weekly attendances of up to  people every Friday afternoon at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street.The worship group helps those suffering with suicidalthoughts and addictions, using faith as a form of help.Thomas Stewart, who helped set up the group, explained more about the work the group does.“I set up the group with a friend, who  years ago lost his brother who took his own le through suicide,” he said.“It was a total shock to his family and he felt he needed to do something to help others with similar problems.“We started the Divine Mercy group up in  and it was just three of us. It is a time to reflect on le, listen to beautul songs, and a prayer session is also available afterwards for those who wish to get involved in that.“I think with the issues of addictions with drugs and alcohol becoming more of an issue in North Belfast, the Divine Mercy group offers something dferent to anyone who is seeking help.“Whatever is going on in your own le or your family’s le,your son or daughter is suicidal or has addiction problems, I would encourage you to come along to the Divine Mercy group.“There is help available, which is why people come back. It’s an outlet for people also and a comfort zone for them. The Divine Mercy gives these people hope.“There are young lads coming here who are broken in their lives. The reason we can draw them in is because we are all from dferent backgrounds and we are able to reach out to them.”One of the great successes of the Divine Mercy group has been the regular Cursillo residential weekends in Benburb.The Cursillo runs from a Thursday evening to a Sunday afternoon with participants able to meet people and explore their faith further in a serene and spiritual environment.Hugh Byrne, another key figure in the Divine Mercy group, said the Cursillo is a le-changing experience for those involved.“After three days, they are dferent people. It is truly a le-changing experience and I have seen that with people over the years.”Hugh is also responsible for talking to anyone who comes to the Divine Mercy group in order to offer help and advice.“I sit and have a chat with the lads every week,” he added.“If I get them to listen, that is the start. If we help turn one person’s le around, that is better than none.“I ask them how far they are in their addiction whether it would be alcohol or drugs.“Some people have fallen away but there have been a lot of successes. Relationships and marriages have been fixed and people have turned their lives around.“We also have good links with rehabilitation services and other helplines to point people towards further help.”At last Friday’s meeting, the group were joined by some American visitors who ed to Belfast a year on from experiencing the Divine Mercy group for the first time.Thomas says the success of the group has been extremely encouraging and a sign that they are on the right path.“It was great to see the visitors from the USA who were here last year and wanted to come back over again,” continued.“They are going back to spread the word about the work the group does.“The group can only get better. We started with just three people so we have come a long away in quite a short time.“People are coming back so we must be doing something right.“We have the prayers and so on and then we come out and sit and have tea, coffee and biscuits. It is great to see everyone bonding and talking to each other.“People don’t realise how powerful the Divine Mercy is. It doesn’t matter what is going on in your le. Ask for help and reach out to the Divine Mercy.”The Divine Mercy group meets every Friday at pm at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street and all are welcome to come along."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"squeeze on school places gets worse","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw says a fundamental reform in the allocation of school places is needed, after figures showed a soaring demand for places in South Belfast,with well over a quarter of applicants now not getting their first choice.Ms Bradshaw revealed statistics released to her by the Education Authority outlining the number over the past five years of school admissions.In ,  pupils living in South Belfast applied for a post-primary place –  pupils were offered a place at first preference whilst  were refused.In , out of a total of  applications,  pupils were offered a place at first preference, with  refused.“The number of pupils seeking places in South Belfast post-primary schools has risen from  to  in the past five years, yet Area Planning seems to have managed to miss this completely,” explained Ms Bradshaw.“This defeats the whole purpose of Area Planning. How can it not already have been known that approximately  more pupils would be requiring places over this period  If Area Planning was unable to monitor this correctly, it is entirely unsuited for purpose. It is a complete failure of the system. “The outcome of this failure is drastic. As a consequence, we now have, for the first time, seven pupils in South Belfast not receiving any offer at all for September . Additionally, the number not receiving their first choice rising dramatically from  per cent to  per cent and this will only rise further.“With more than a fth more pupils seeking places in South Belfast than was the case just three years ago, we should have been taking action to address the shortfall in provision we knew was pending.“The increased intake at Lagan and Aquinas, of  places each, can cover only a sixth of that increase and is nothing like sufficient. So, what we are seeing is a comprehensive failure of the whole transfer system in South Belfast.“With ever more new housing in and around South Belfast, this is only going to get worse in years to come. Where is the monitoring of this  What will the requirement be five years from now  What is being done to address it  “The Alliance Party has called, and will continue to call, for a fundamental, independently-led review of education provision with a view to far-reaching transformation recommend-ations being proposed.“A high priority within this process would be a focus on improving Area Planning, so that pupils and their families are not left in the appalling situation where they are left without a school, with the ultimate solution being more educational provision either within existing schools or a new build,” added Ms Bradshaw."},{"url":null,"title":"belfasts north street arcade returning as part of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Most of the structure remains intact.Read MoreBelfast council opposes bid to name £m project after New Yorks TribecaStudent digs and office builds to dominate Belfasts skylineFirm behind Belfasts £m Cathedral Quarter project slams council after Tribeca name rejectedNow developer Castlebrooke Investments has said it is “committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format”. It said space will be designed for independent retailers.Despite a public backlash over the developer’s decision to call the project Tribeca, Castlebrooke has so far refused to budge on the name, which it says is short for ‘Triangle beside the Cathedral’.The company said it relates to the -acre development site located beside St Anne’s Cathedral and which is bounded by Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, Lower Garfield Street and Rosemary Street.Critics point out that the name is already synonymous with the neighbourhood of the same name in New York City.Castlebrooke, which is expected to submit an outline planning application to Belfast City Council in the autumn, has launched a -week public consultation exercise on its proposals.Castlebrooke has already amended some of its original proposal. Most signicantly, a -storey office tower proposed for the corner of Rosemary Street and North Street will now be reduced to  storeys.The developer also said that it will retain a greater number of original buildings in the area.The updated plans also allow for more green spaces, courtyards and residential space.In total, Castlebrooke claims that the entire project will create more than , direct permanent jobs.Despite clinging on to the unpopular Tribeca branding for the project, Castlebrooke Investments’ chief executive Neil Young said yesterday that the firm had demonstrated that it had listened to feedback from the city.“We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.”He said Castlebrooke had already invested £m in the project.Graeme Moore from the Consarc Design Group said: “The proposals respond to the valuable comments of interested parties and the new scheme realises the aspiration of reintroducing the North Street Arcade with the end blocks to North Street and Donegall Street legible once again as entrances to this important connection.”Welcoming the positive nature of the announcement, Queen’s University architecture lecturer Dr Agustina Martire, acting chair of the Save CQ campaign said the group had had a productive meeting with Castlebrooke Investments and their new architects, Squire  Partners, yesterday“We are cautiously optimistic that both are listening and some real progress is being made,” she said.“Both Castlebrooke and their new architects have responded positively to us in terms of the local economy, housing, heritage, public space and accessibility however sufficient arts and culture provision within the proposed redevelopment remains a real concern.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexits impact on many crossborder initiatives finally revealed in report","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals. There is also cross-border cooperation on organ and tissues transplants. Nineteen areas are linked to the avoiding a hard border objective and include everything from customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.Current EU rules \"stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\".

Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be. He said: \"The British Government has now convened a  of experts to determine the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the North. \"It neednt have bothered as a range of experts have already given dire warnings of the disastrous impact a no-deal Brexit will have on the Norths economy, our rights and the Good Friday Agreement.\" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the documents were part of \"initial scoping work\" by the Government, supported by the Civil Service here, the European Commission and the Republic.Mr Lidington said they were intended to form the basis of discussion and not final products.

These included a two-night trip to Paradise Island resort in January , just three weeks before his official trip on behalf of the government.  It also obtained internal records showing that two years earlier, Mr Paisley had travelled to the Males for a luxury holiday with his we and two children at one of the country’s most exclusive resorts.According to Spotlight, the family stayed free of charge at the Kandolhu Island Resort in April , which had recently opened following a multi-million pound refurbishment.Social media posts made by Fiona Paisley appeared to back up the claims.In April , five days after the trip, Mrs Paisley reportedly tweeted: “No more holiday mode” complete with a palm tree emoji.In , she commented on posts on the Kandolhu Resort’s Facebook page, writing: “Take me back” and “Remembering that view ... bliss”.Mr Paisley was previously suspended from the House of Commons for  sitting days for serious misconduct after he failed to declare two family holidays to Sri Lanka in .He also narrowly avoided facing a by-election after Parliament’s first ever recall petition fell short of the number of constituent signatures required to oust him by around .Mr Paisley has not responded to the new claims made in last night’s Spotlight.A DUP spokesperson told the BBC: “Discipline is an internal party matter.“We do not give a running commentary.“All members are treated fairly and have a right to due process.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp shannon to be investigated again over parliamentary expenses","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":null,"title":"lorry driver whistleblower was pinned to wall by his boss tribunal is told","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Hurson referred to a series of text messages he received while he was in Luton, instructing him to carry out four collections before getting a boat from Cairnryan to Larne. \"How is that possible within  hours \" Mr Hurson asked.The assignment was amended before Mr Hurson got a boat from Holyhead to Dublin, where he was told a van would meet him with a fresh driver. He claimed he was expected to drive back to Lurgan, despite exceeding his legal driving limit. \"You dont knowyoure going to be a passenger or a driver until the van arrives,\" he said. However, barrister Barry Mulqueen, who is representing Agro Merchants Group, said the claimant didnt drive the van home.Mr Hurson outlined how he made subsequent disclosures before turning to a third party company called Expo Link which investigates whistleblower claims for major clients including Tesco.He claimed this led to a member of staff from the retail giant contacting Agro Merchant Group, which forced it to introduce changes. The claimant said he only became aware of this information and the fact that Mr Malcolm had made a statement accepting his version of events regarding the assault in January this year. Up until this point Mr Hurson said he had been told by director George Lee that \"there was no evidence of a physical altercation\" between him and Mr Malcolm. Thomas McKearney from the Independent Workers Union told the tribunal he was told \"Mr Malcolm came from behind his desk and pinned him up against the wall\".Mr Mulqueen said the claimants complaint is about a breach of his contractual obligations and not about a breach of the law. He also claimed Mr Hursons \"sole motive\" and \"obsession\" is money. Tribunal chairman Brian Greene expressed confusion when Mr Mulqueen claimed Mr Malcolm - who previously accepted the claimants account of the assault - now disputes it. The tribunal continues."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38254594.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/press_1-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"paisley faces holiday claims backlash sf and sdlp demand answers as dup to consider serious issues raised","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Every shop front on the Main Street and beyond has had a facelt, signs have been replaced, roads resurfaced, new pavements installed and lighting and railings have been enhanced as part of a multi-million revamp ahead of the th Open at Royal Portrush in July.The major regeneration programme was led and funded by the Department for Communities .DfC Permanent Secretary Tracy Meharg said the programme was one of the last to be signed off before Stormont collapsed. She said it was a \"game changer\" for the north coast.\"The departments investment has really made a dference to the whole feel and appearance of the town,\" she said.\"All of these improvements have led to a brighter, more vibrant, better connected, safer Portrush that will serve the many visitors and residents who use the town for years to come.\"Richard Baker from Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council said the regeneration package \"meant everything\" to the people of Portrush.\"If you look at Portrush  years ago, ahead of the Irish Open, it was being described in less than flattering terms,\" he said. \"The whole street-scape and shop fronts, it was just a patchwork of material. Whereas this £m has transformed the town.\"Now we have  million people in  countries worldwide about to watch The Open. You simply couldnt buy that publicity and positive PR.\"The towns -year-old mayor, Sean Bateson, said he was feeling \"a little pressure\" about the eyes of the world being on him, but looking forward to the opportunities The Open will bring.\"The town is looking absolutely fantastic,\" he said. \"The people here are buzzing and so positive about it all. We have one of the biggest sporting events right here on our doorstep and we are looking brilliant. Im going to do my very best over The Open to highlight not only the north coast but the north of Ireland. So theres a little pressure on me, but Im going to enjoy it all.\"Local trader John McAfee from the Vintage Stop antiques store on Main Street said the facelt is just what Portrush needed. He has a wealth of golfing memorabilia to put in the shop window, including golf clubs from the s, to attract golf fans.\"With The Open coming, we have the chance to showcase ourselves,\" he said. \"We really needed a facelt. Portrush has been run down for a number of years. Hopefully with the influx of tourists and customers we will be sitting pretty.\" Andy Hill from Troggs Surf Shop across the street was able to paint his shopfront with funding. He is hoping to offer surfing lessons to any of the golfers who fancy a dip.\"With the painting and the new signage, we now look brand new,\" he said. \"I have lived in the town for  years and it has never looked better.\" Drew McLean, manager of the Spar store in Eglinton Street said he hoped its facelt will attract Tiger Woods to sample its world famous Portrush Rock.\"We are just finishing off our facelt,\" he said. \"It looks great, but Im not sure how The Open will go for us. It might be quiet as the town will be blocked off and you have to have a pass to get in. But Im sure well be busy in the evenings. Im just hoping that Tiger Woods will hear about our bars of rock and come in to grab a few.\"Other work that is part of the regeneration includes an Urban Development Grant scheme which will help bring derelict and vacant properties back to le and into economic use. DfCs Tracy Meharg said that while the focus is now on work ahead of The Open, there is \"more to come\"\"The Portrush Regeneration Programme is also about putting the town in a position to maximise the economic benefits that the legacy event will present,\" she said.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

It has committed to spending  billion euro on the project.“This is a big turnaround,” Mr Varadkar said.“The company is now saying that it can do this project for  billion euro andthat’s the case I’m all ears and we have to listen to it.“We need to knowthis offer is real, we need to knowit stacks up. We need to know what kind of delay would be imposed on people in rural Ireland waiting for broadbandwe went back to a new procurement process. There would have to be a new procurement process.”Mr Varadkar said one of his concerns was that the cost savings Eir was offering would be met by imposing higher charges on the , homes, farms and businesses in rural areas.He said any higher charges or fees to customers would be a “serious problem” for the Government.The Taoiseach was speaking after the leader of the opposition accused the Government of being “too dismissive” of Eir’s claim that it could deliver the National Broadband Plan for less than a billion euro.Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin welcomed the Government’s decision to look at what Eir was offering.But Mr Martin claimed former communications minster Denis Naughten “got too close to the Granahan McCourt consortium and the political and electoral imperative took over and the issue of costs went out the window”.He said costs had “ballooned” from the  estimates, never mind the original estimate of  million euro.“You’ve been too dismissive, so far, of people who have raised legitimate questions about this issue,” he said.“You’ve been too dismissive yesterday of the Eir submission. It deserves further analysis. I think alternatives should be considered.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn spokesman denies labour leader is in hock to unions over brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was – which they shared with us – on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.”He added: “There has been no proper audit done during the referendum. There is certainly evidence of suspicious Russian activity during the referendum and where.”"},{"url":null,"title":"parties asks mp standards watchdog to investigate fresh ian paisley holiday claims","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone MBE, is in charge of regulating MPs conduct and propriety.A spokeswoman for her office told the Belfastit is unable to confirm or deny whether the commissioner is investigating the fresh allegation relating to Mr Paisley due to a decision parliament took last year that the commissioner should not disclose such details.If the commissioner does receive an allegation, she will first look at whether the matter is within her remit and whether there is sufficient evidence to justy an inquiry. If she thinks there is grounds for an investigation, she will launch an investigation unless it is more appropriate for a dferent authority to investigate.If the commissioner does investigate, details of the investigation would only become public at the end of her work.Last December BBC Spotlight raised queries over who paid for a luxury holiday the DUP MP and his family took to the Coco Bodu Hithi resort in the nation in .Mr Paisley said then that he paid for part of the holiday and the rest was paid for by a friend.He did not reveal the identity of this friend, but added that the friend was unconnected with his work and has received no benefit as a result of his work.On Tuesday night, a follow-up BBC Spotlight programme, Paisley In Paradise Revisited, reported that the friend was Dr Mohamed Shainee, who at the time of Mr Paisley’s trip to Coco Bodu Hithi was the Males Fisheries and Agriculture Minister.Dr Shainee told the programme he did not pay for the trip.However the programme reported that in a statement, Sunland Hotels which owns the resort, told them: “In , Mohamed Shainee requested Sunland Hotels co-owner Hussain Hilmy for a rate at one of the company’s resorts … Shainee settled the payment for Ian Paisley’s stay at the head office”."},{"url":null,"title":"small businesses feeling the pressure over business rates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

so-called liquidity mismatch pose a potential risk to the financial system in the UK and worldwide.“This is a big deal. You can see something that could be systemic,” he told the cross-party Treasury Select Committee.If we cant get the world to move on it, well have to take our own responsibility here in co-ordination with the FCAMark Carney, Bank of England governor“These funds are built on a lie, which is that you can have daily liquidity for assets that fundamentally aren’t liquid.“And that leads to an expectation of iniduals that it’s not that dferent to having money in a bank.”His comments come after thousands of investors have seen their cash trapped in investment guru Neil Woodford’s flagship equity income fund after it was suspended on June .The fund was gated after millions of pounds had been taken out following a run of poor results.In a hearing on the Bank’s recent inflation report, Mr Carney told MPs that together with fellow policymaker Sir John Cunlfe, they had been seeking to raise the issue of liquidity mismatch at a global level since .He said regulations needed changing to prevent these funds offering investors the prospect of instant access to their cash.This needs to be a globally co-ordinated action to address this problem, he cautioned.But he added: “If we can’t get the world to move on it, we’ll have to take our own responsibility here in co-ordination with the FCA .“We do have to be very deliberate about the types of measures that need to be taken — something that better aligns the redemption terms with the actual liquidity of the underlying investment is infinitely preferable to the situation we have today.”The warning follows calls for an overhaul of “flawed” EU regulations surrounding the funds from FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey on Tuesday.Mr Bailey – seen as a frontrunner to replace Mr Carney when he steps down in January – told MPs that managers of the Woodford fund were “using the rules to the full” and exploiting loopholes.Due to many of the investments in the Woodford fund being made into unlisted companies, selling the shares to repay the cash has proved dficult.The fund was worth around £ billion at its peak in , but has fallen to between £. billion and £ billion.The FCA has launched an enforcement investigation into the Woodford saga.It is also due to review the suspension of the fund next week under the -day deadline."},{"url":null,"title":"bojonoshow the joke answers from jeremy hunts twitter qa session","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Since , Denmark has accepted about  such refugees every year.The government also wants to fight plastic pollution and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by % ahead of , a goal praised by Greenpeace.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Leaders of left-wing parties in Denmark say they will back the centre-left Social Democrats The four Danish parties also agreed to drop plans to put rejected asylum-seekers and foreigners convicted of crimes on a tiny island that formerly housed facilities for researching contagious animal diseases. They also would reverse some austerity measures in health care and education.Inger Stoejberg, the outgoing immigration minister known for being a hardliner, criticised the Social Democrats for striking a deal that compromised their self-declared tough immigration stance. They had promised “a strict immigration policy” but “one can’t trust” them, she said.The June  elections for Denmark’s -seat Folketing, or Parliament, dealt a blow to the populist, anti-immigration Danish People’s Party, which had been supporting Denmark’s centre-right prime minister, who resigned.

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years. The first set of minors he was involved with were probably the likes of Conor Woods, so, itrsquos going back a bit.ldquoHaving him there with what people would probably say is a relatively inexperienced management team as well as a relatively inexperienced team on the field of play has become very important, he added.ldquoWe see this as a bit of a journey over the next two to three years and Diarmuid being there to help build along the way will make a massive dference. Sheehan also believes that OrsquoSullivan has made a big impact on the players and he canrsquot praise him highly enough.ldquoIn terms of his knowledge of the game and the wee bits of coaching he does around how to tackle, there have been huge strides, Sheehan said.ldquoTackling was definitely something we felt we needed to work on, we were giving away too many frees in the past.

The former health minister became embroiled in a row recently about whether he provided funds for women from this side of the Irish Sea to travel to the mainland for abortions.He also claims that a new Brexit negotiating team, including members of the DUP, can persuade the European Union to drop its plans for the backstop that could ide Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, because its leaders “understand thatwill not get through parliament”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p Boris Johnson was a regular visitor to Co Antrim, when he was London mayor. He bought a fleet of brand new Routemaster buses from the Ballymena coachmakers, Wrightbus. At the DUP’s last annual conference, Boris was the keynote speaker, attacking Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement on the basis that Northern Ireland would become “in large part ruled by Brussels” rather than London or Stormont.Yet, he voted for that agreement, including the backstop, in March, when it was defeated for the third time in the House of Commons. Previously, the former foreign secretary told an audience of businessmen that “it’s beyond belief that we’re allowing thetail to wag the dog”, as we leave the EU. He was making a point against the backstop, but his statement could be read as a chilling warning to unionists about what to expectthere’s a direct choice between delivering Brexit and protecting Ulster’s links to the rest of the UK.Last week, YouGov published a heavily publicised poll, suggesting most Conservative members believe that leaving the EU is more important than preserving the Union. They were responding to hypothetical questions and the answers may have been driven more by short-term anger than enduring political sentiments, but it would be complacent to dismiss the results. More than ever, the UK needs a premier who cherishes the Union and tries to neutralise the forces that threaten to pull it apart.On the same day as YouGov released its survey, the influential centre-right think-tank, Policy Exchange, published a paper asking, “what do we want from the next prime minister ” DUP man John Finlay: ‘I warmly welcome the banner in Ballymoney in support of Soldier F’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Its author, Lord Bew, who was one of David Trimble’s closest advisers, wrote, “in an era in which the Union is being questioned and challenged the cohesion of the British nation state must be the highest priority of anyone seeking to hold the highest office.”It’s a critical point, but the seeming ambivalence of Tory members to the survival of the United Kingdom suggests it will be dficult to persuade the leadership candidates of its merits.The integrity of our nation state has so far been a relatively marginal issue in the race to become leader. If the bulk of Conservatives, whose votes will choose the next prime minister, are cavalier about the future of the United Kingdom —achieving Brexit eclipses economic considerations, party loyalty and even the potential break-up of the country — then neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Hunt will win by making the Union a central theme of their campaign.The damage to the bonds that tie together the UK didn’t start with Brexit or even the independence referendum in Scotland. The advent of devolution in the s created lasting tensions between central and regional governments that have never been addressed properly. The administrations in Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardf allowed nationalists to nurture grievances against Westminster and bred resentment in England, where taxpayers felt they were funding generous public services in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.This erosion of our common political identity meant that there was serious hostility to the idea we could take a major constitutional decision like Brexit as a single nation. Nationalists and die-hard Remainers tried to pick apart the referendum result, claiming that England forced its choice on Northern Ireland and Scotland. We’ve even heard people who once called themselves unionists or said they were neutral on the constitutional question indulging in this blatantly separatist logic. Some Leave-supporting Tories, like the MP Daniel Kawczynski, have started to advocate something like the mirror-image of these arguments. They blame Northern Irish unionists for blocking Brexit. “We have still not left the European Union,” he claims, “because the DUP absolutely categorically refused to contemplate the Northern Ireland backstop.” It’s aswe should accept being ripped apart from the rest of the UK and placed under the authority of Brussels, so that the rest of the country can leave more smoothly.In theory, Conservative party members should be among the most dependable supporters of a strong, integrated United Kingdom. But three years of angry disputes over delivering Brexit have undermined this country’s sense of togetherness and a dangerous sense of frustration has clearly taken hold of the Tory grassroots.Whether Jeremy Hunt or Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, and whatever type of Brexit the new leader manages to negotiate, unionists must hope that he prioritises rebuilding the bonds that hold our country together.try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer critically ill family lsquodevastatedrsquo by VSSTwo people found dead in N.I. house -

As anticipation builds for next month’s Open at Royal Portrush, the veteran radio and TV presenter visited the host course as well as clubs like Royal Belfast, Royal County Down and the town of St Andrews in Scotland – recognised internationally as the home of golf. Gery Kelly and Bill MontgomeryGerry starts his journey at his home club in Ardglass tracing the beginnings of golf in Ireland and reveals a few surprises as he discovers the relatively unknown Ulster-Scots golfing pioneers who helped establish the sport here.He visits stately homes including Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough and Grey Abbey House – chatting with Lady Rose Lauritzen and William Montgomery – and travels to St Andrews to explore how the Scots claim to have invented the sport and what part they played in bringing the game across the Irish Sea. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p He also sets out to finally answer the age-old dispute about which club is actually the oldest in Ireland. Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history. Gery Kelly at St Andrews“The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that golf was played in Scotland in the s and it took over  years before it came here. With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now. I used to play off single figures, now I’m a teenager , it’s about the craic with your fourball. “We would get out once or twice a weekend and play for a fiver. It’s the most important three or four hours of the week to win that fiver.”Links To The Past: Pioneers Of Ulster Golf is on BBC Two Northern Ireland tomorrow night at pm.The one-hour film has been produced by NPE Media for BBC Northern Ireland, with support from the Ulster-Scots Broadcast Fund.l Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]]]]]]]Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Politics      Two in police custody after Carrick lsquoknersquo incidentTwo men have been arrested in Carrick following an alleged kne incident earlier today.

Internal material referring to the role repeatedly refers to the importance of responding to the RHI Inquiry.The new communications post follows Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly’s decision to create a senior PR role which was filled by David Gordon, the former Executive spin doctor and editor of the Nolan Show, eight months after Stormont’s collapse.The News Letter asked DoFit had considered the implications of the creation of a cadre of powerful public relations figures in each department, especiallydevolution s and they are operating under rival ministers. It also asked about the inherent tension between appointing the same inidual to both oversee FoI requests and head up the department’s press office, which attempts to present a positive spin on whatever the department has done.Ian Paisley silent in face of new questions over more luxury foreign tripsVeteran civil rights campaigner Ivan Cooper passes away Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The department said that FoI had “not been amalgamated within the press office” and said it was “committed to open government and all FoI requests are handled in accordance with the legislation”.It added: “The reason for aligning open government and FoI is to help inform our openness agenda.”Officials working to create the new communications post moved with unusual alacrity, circumventing the normal cumbersome processes involved with such a situation because of the urgency and importance attached to the role by DoF permanent secretary Sue Gray.In an April  email to a colleague, civil service human resources officer Sonya Kilpatrick said of the urgency: “Sorry this is not ideal but you will understand that this is not normal process and we are all working outside of process to get it done quickly”. On another occasion, Ms Kilpatrick told the permanent secretary that “as you know there are certain formalities that we have to adhere [to] but we have cut these back as much as possible ... I appreciate the launch is one week later than you wanted but we have compressed the timetable as much as possible andall goes to plan you will have the result within six weeks”.The post will involve work “to create a closer sense of corporacy and unity across the department and the wider NICS”.try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer critically ill family lsquodevastatedrsquo by VSSTwo people found dead in N.I. house -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add.

North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
