The report also quoted a Chinese military who said the JL-3 would have a full operational range of between 7,456 miles and 8,700 miles, which is enough to destroy targets in most part of the United States from Chinese coasts.  The allegedly test of the missile has also been reported by The Diplomat. The current-affairs magazine reported yesterday that Beijing conducted the flight-test of the JL-3 ballistic missile in the Bohai Sea. However, it claimed that the test took place on November 24, citing U.S. intelligence agencies.The report also said JL-3 did not fly to its full range during the test, but its full range was likely to be farther than 9,000 kilometres (5,592 miles).China has never openly confirmed the development of JL-3. Nearly all of the information of the missile on the Chinese internet is cited from U.S. media reports.        Previous U.S. reports have suggested that JL-3 was an improved version of Beijing\u0027s Dongfeng-41, or DF-41 ballistic missile. DF-41 is said to have the longest range of any ballistic rockets in the world. JL-3 was also mentioned in this year\u0027s annual report about China from the U.S. Department of Defence to the U.S. congress. The report said: \u0027China\u0027s next-generation Type 096 SSBN (ballistic missile submarines), reportedly to be armed with the follow-on JL-3 SLBM (submarine-launched ballistic missile), will likely begin construction in the early-2020s.\u0027This contradicts the reports from Washington Free Beacon and The Diplomat which claimed that the Type 096 submarine was being constructed already. According to a report from Sina Military in July, Beijing will begin building the Type 096 submarine \u0027in a few years\u0027.  China Conducts First Test of New JL-3 Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile | The Diplomat"},{"url":null,"title":"Harvey Weinstein met lineup actresses including Marisa Tomei Jennifer Esposito","story":"Sister act: Weinstein was met with a gallery filled with actresses after arriving in court on Thursday (l to r:  Jennifer Esposito, Marissa Tomei, Amber Tamblyn and Michelle Hurd)           Suspended: Weinstein could not keep his suspenders on as he made his way through the metal detectors at the courthouse (above)           Unity: Tomei and the other women were all wearing Time\u0027s Up shirts as they headed into the courthouse The women chose not to speak ahead of the hearing, but Najimy did state: \u0027I’m here to hear the proceeding and support survivors.\u0027 The judge ultimately ruled that Weinstein would face rape charges, saying that the indictment would not be dismissed in the case. The pre-trial hearing was set for March 7. The actresses who appeared in court all did so in support of the victims and Time\u0027s Up movement.Weinstein meanwhile was seen limping in and out of the courtroom, and his suspenders had come undone at one point causing his gut to hang over his pants. There had been a report that Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence would be appearing to stare down Weinstein, but that proved to be false. REVEALED: DOZENS of prison letters sent to Chris Watts in...Gayle King is frustrated with leadership at CBS and execs...Share this articleThe disgraced mogul was looking to have the five remaining charges that have been filed against him dismissed, and in a  letter earlier this month his lawyer lashed out at a comment made by prosecutors.\u0027The defendant has a misguided and antiquated view of how a rape victim should react after having been assaulted,\u0027 wrote prosecutor Kevin Wilson in response to a letter submitted to the court last week.In the letter, Weinstein\u0027s lawyer wrote: \u0027What is misguided and antiquated is the breathtaking assertion by the prosecution that it was free to present the Grand Jury in this case with a knowingly incomplete, untrue, and distorted picture of the true facts of this case and thereby suppress from the Grand Jury critical exculpatory evidence which went directly to Mr. Weinstein\u0027s factual innocence of any criminal wrongdoing.\u0027The attack did not stop there, going on to accuse witnesses of being untruthful.\u0027Contrary to what Mr. Wilson would have us believe, the issue before this Court is one of law and not political correctness,\u0027 read the letter.\u0027At the time they made their presentment to the Grand Jury in this case, the prosecution (1) failed to present witness statements which revealed material untruths told by the complaining witnesses and (2) willfully chose not to present documentary evidence which reflected immediate and then continuing contact with the alleged rapist-beginning just hours after the alleged rape and continuing on for several years thereafter.\u0027Weinstein\u0027s attorney previously filed a letter with the judge seeking to dismiss three of the charges that he was indicted on over the summer.Ben Brafman, Weinstein\u0027s attorney in the case, claimed in his letter to Judge James M Burke that the Manhattan District Attorney\u0027s office withheld evidence from the grand jury who indicted his client and provides four emails that show Weinstein and his accuser spent time together after her alleged assault.He also claimed that the accuser told a friend that her relationship with Weinstein was consensual.

There’s a roaring fire and the place is decorated with quaint, and faintly freaky bric-a-brac (I can see a stuffed cat dressed in a Santa suit).‘I love eccentric London. Eccentric England,’ Patti said happily.She picked the venue, having enjoyed an arvo spread at the Zetter’s sister hotel in Marylebone.Tea isn’t such a big deal in the United States. ‘No, not at all,’ she agreed, before popping a glazed gammon and piccalilli delicacy into her mouth.‘We have breakfast, lunch and dinner. That’s it. How did this happen?!’ she asked as we go on to discuss the rules of taking tea and whether the jam goes on the scone before the cream and how thrilled she’d been, years ago, tasting clotted cream for the first time.‘The jam has to go on first, right? Otherwise you smash the cream?’ she said (she is correct, by the way, in my opinion).The idea for tea with Patti came when Chris Harper, business partner of Company’s celebrated director Marianne Elliott, mentioned in passing that many of the ‘boys’ from Company enjoy popping into the actress’s stage level dressing room.‘What we have are Patti’s Panderings,’ she said...the name given to the gatherings by Richard Fleeshman, who plays Andy, the dim but strapping flight attendant whom Bobbi wants to devour during a number called Barcelona.Patti explained that ‘the guys come into my dressing room between numbers, and at the end of the first act…there’s plenty of room — and their rooms are way up the stairs.’Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it\u0027s Superdog! Grinning...Inuits fear the curse of HMS Terror has been reawakened by...Share this articleShe and her esteemed dresser Murray Lane started feeding them. Apples with almond butter, and other tidbits. Ashley Campbell arrived one day with smoked salmon and cream cheese. George Blagden brought sausage rolls. Sometimes Patti picks up mini pork pies from a posh butcher in Holborn and serves them with chutney. A fruit course might include clementines and strawberries. ‘They’re only little nibbles,’ she said.‘We gossip, and everybody’s listening for the cue to go back on stage. It’s turned into this very sweet, wonderful bonding of the company. In my dressing room.’The Broadway legend said that ‘the guys have banned the women’ — though Mel Giedroyc shows up anyway.‘I don’t know why the women were banned,’ Patti mused. ‘If there’s anything left over, we give it to the girls.’With Christmas approaching ‘we’re going wild now’, she said, adding mince pies to the snacking menu.I told her that, in my opinion, the best are to be found at Maison Bertaux in Soho (I shall be leaving a few at the stage door for them).It’s clear Patti has been enjoying her time in London. She will remain here until Company closes on March 30. ‘I couldn’t be happier,’ she said, with a cat-that-got-the-clotted-cream kind of smile. ‘Happy on stage, and content in my life. That’s the way I phrase it.‘Usually with musicals I’m like: “When’s it’s going to end?” I’m already mourning the end of this one, because it’s a great experience.’And it’s a great show. I caught up with Company (for about the fourth or fifth time) a couple of days before our tea date, and every performance has deepened: Patti’s and Rosalie’s in particular.The Juilliard School-trained thespian clearly adores her co-star — and the whole of the company of Company — and is torn about repeating the role if the show plays on Broadway. Which I’m certain it will.She said she faced a similar dilemma when she played in the original cast of Les Miserables at the Barbican, where she created the role of Fantine. (She also played Norma Desmond in the original, West End production of Sunset Boulevard.)‘This is my company — I belong to this company,’ she said. ‘I had said that I’d never do another musical on Broadway. But I did this for Marianne, in London. I had no idea it would turn out to be this happy, incredible experience.’But doing it in New York? Starting in a new musical there would be ‘so complicated’. ‘You start your first rehearsal exhausted. You start the run exhausted.’And then there’s the acting...We discuss a revival of a play in New York which we both saw and both struggled to understand.‘I get told off about my diction but at this I was going “What did they say?!” I wanted to shout: “Slow down! Enunciate!!”’And the musical performances haven’t been much better. ‘I go: “Really? Really?! You call that a leading lady? You call that a leading man?” They don’t come across the footlights.’She noted that the great Ethel Merman (whom she never saw, live) could hit the theatre’s back wall without a microphone. A rare occurrence today.‘They’re forgetting how to P R O J E C T,’ she enunciated, with such command that hotel staff 20 yards away leapt to attention.‘Often they’re miscast, just because they had success on TV or something. They’re not successful, because they’re limited — because they don’t come across the footlights.‘I think people forget that they’re doing it for an audience, and that there’s more to it than learning the lines and singing as beautifully as you can.‘You have to want to do it. You have to have the technique to do it. You have to be fearless.’          \u0027It’s clear Patti has been enjoying her time in London. She will remain here until Company closes on March 30. ‘I couldn’t be happier,’ she said, with a cat-that-got-the-clotted-cream kind of smile. ‘Happy on stage, and content in my life. That’s the way I phrase it\u0027She went on to praise Rosalie Craig. ‘She makes me cry because I’ve seen women her age in musicals who have gotten great reviews and even won awards and I’ve gone “Why?”‘But watching Rosalie is different. She’s the essence of what a leading lady in musical theatre should be.’We paused, while she sampled more delights from ‘Aunt Wilhelmina’s’ menu (little sandwiches), and I tackled ‘Uncle Seymour’ (Scotch quail eggs, mini truffled sausage rolls).There were cakes, and two snowman Pavlovas, which we happily donated Jo Davidson, my long-suffering photographer.We could have carried on for hours, but five o’clock was fast approaching and Patti wanted to get to the Gielgud. Her progress to the door was slowed by a group of American actors at the next table, keen to fete her. And who could blame them.Here’s to the sensational lady … who drinks tea.   Ben\u0027s unlikely blonde ambitionSome like it hot, and Ben Whishaw is preparing to walk through the flames to portray Marilyn Monroe in a new play. Yes, that’s what I said.Whishaw will star in a new work by Anne Carson, the renowned classics professor and poet. ‘It’s called Norma Jeane Baker Of Troy,’ the actor told me. ‘Norma Jeane Baker was Monroe’s real name and the play’s about Marilyn Monroe — and I play her . . . sort of.’He added that the American soprano Renee Fleming will sing in the production, which is being directed by Katie Mitchell at The Shed, a new arts complex opening in Manhattan in the spring.  \u0027Some like it hot, and Ben Whishaw (left) is preparing to walk through the flames to portray Marilyn Monroe (right) in a new play. Yes, that’s what I saidWhishaw is on the big screen at the moment in the delightful Mary Poppins Returns — he plays grown up Michael Banks, with Emily Mortimer as his sister Jane. The magical nanny, deliciously played by Emily Blunt, returns to Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane to help the siblings as much as Michael’s three young children.Whishaw sings in the Poppins film but stressed that he won’t in Norma Jeane Baker Of Troy.‘It’s about as far away from Mary Poppins as you could possibly go,’ he told me.Carson’s piece, partly spoken and partly sung, is based on the Greek tragedy of Helen, the beauty whose face launched a thousand ships. Scholars have tried before to link the allure of Monroe with the Ancient Greeks. Moral philosophy lecturer Dr Edward Spence, for instance, noted Monroe’s comment in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes that ‘when love goes wrong, nothing goes right’, claiming that ‘Plato would agree’.After Marilyn, Whishaw will join his 007 colleagues, as Q, in Bond 25, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga.   Now that\u0027s what I call a super-scary power coupleDirector Adam McKay sets the opening scene of his film Vice, about Dick Cheney, George W. Bush’s vice president, in the town of Casper, Wyoming.It’s 1963 and Cheney, then a very unpolished young man, is shown drunk as a skunk.McKay then cuts to a shot of Cheney sitting in the White House Situation Room, where he has taken control of operations after the 911 attacks in 2001. Bush was being flown to a place of safety — which suited Cheney just fine.          Director Adam McKay sets the opening scene of his film Vice, about Dick Cheney, George W.

Amy Adams stars as Lynne Cheney in Vice          \u0027In the film Cheney is seen in 1963 then a very unpolished young man\u0027.Christian Bale as Dick Cheney in Adam McKayMcKay’s masterstroke was to cast Christian Bale and Amy Adams as Cheney and his wife Lynne. They are sublime.‘I’ve never seen someone so purely interested in power,’ McKay said of Cheney. Equally, it’s rare that I’ve seen performances, such as the ones Bale and Adams deliver, that embody that sense of power on the screen.McKay said he and Bale spent a lot of time talking about characters who internalise their emotions. ‘They cover themselves up and Christian’s very good at giving life to such people,’ McKay said. Cheney may not have been a great orator but ‘he knew that the real power resides in the ones who are out of the spotlight’.McKay added that while preparing the film he thought of the 1986 movie Sid And Nancy, about Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen. Both were junkies.‘That was a love story,’ he commented, and this is a love story, too. ‘Lynne Cheney wanted safety, security — and she wanted control. And if Dick was going to be with her, he’s going to get those things. He has to, if he loves her.‘I kept thinking of Sid and Nancy and how one of them had to become what the other wanted, if they wanted to be together,’ he told me when we met at the Soho Hotel. ‘There are people in Casper who to this day claim that no matter who Lynne married, he would have made it to the White House.’You’re drawn in by the Cheneys in Vice — but they scare you half to death too.I’ve long been fascinated by the intricacies of American politics, so Vice was like caviar to me. It received six Golden Globes nominations, so I will watch with interest at the Globes’ ceremony in Beverly Hills on January 6.

As of August, 14 of them had been launched and the rest are being built, it is reported.Other vessels observed include icebreaker Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, and its upgraded version Xue Long 2. Xue Long 2, China\u0027s first self-developed icebreaker,  was launched from the Jiangnan Shipyard in September. The ship is China\u0027s second polar research vessel and puts Beijing on par with Washington in terms of operational icebreakers. Seven to 10 Type 726A air-cushioned landing crafts were also found to be moored at the shipyard throughout the year.

Chris Evans and his wife, Natasha, leave Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey with their newborn twins, and Eli, six, and Noah, nineThis is no mean achievement for someone starting at 6.30am for a three-hour show, five days a week and Evans attracts an audience of all ages.The students I talk to as Master of Selwyn College, Cambridge, will mention Evans\u0027 name much more frequently than those of the news agenda-setters on Radio 4 or whoever is currently doing the Radio 1 breakfast show.The sobbing you hear is therefore not just from listeners but from BBC bosses who are losing one of their main assets to a direct rival.The Evans ratings have had a slight wobble recently and dipped below 9 million a week, but they still beat all other radio programmes and are two million ahead of Radio 4\u0027s flagship Today. They also dwarf almost all television audiences in this multi-channel world.This success shouldn\u0027t obscure the gamble that the BBC took in putting Evans onto the Radio 2 breakfast show eight years ago.He was taking over from the ultimate broadcasting icon, Sir Terry Wogan and there was the starkest of contrasts between a laid-back wordsmith Irishman and a hyperactive and sometimes rebellious DJ who had made his reputation in shows for young people.The shift was from Wogan\u0027s one-to-one conversational style into Evans\u0027 morning \u0027zoo\u0027 with seemingly a cast of thousands but what they both had was a warmth and an invitation to be part of their club, and that has retained the loyalty of listeners.I had some experience of the Evans\u0027 style when he was part of the line-up for the London 2012 Olympics, which I was running for the BBC.We wanted to build up excitement for the Games across all the BBC\u0027s services, and Evans did that in spades on Radio 2. His show was relocated to the Olympic Park, and I went along for the duty \u0027BBC suit\u0027 interview on the morning of the opening ceremony.I\u0027m taking a guess that there were a few million other people he\u0027d rather have been talking to, but he was glowing in his welcome without being sycophantic and impishly intelligent in his questioning. It was one of those rare occasions when a boss could be part of a feelgood experience.Like Wogan, he makes you feel part of his clubBut the flip side of the Evans Olympic experience happened later in the Games. BBC management had taken a tough line in resisting a bombardment of suggestions from Downing Street that the then prime minister David Cameron would be the perfect guest for our Olympic programming.There must have been something about the record audiences on TV and radio, and the national exuberance, that the Conservatives wanted to convert into political advantage – and we were determined to keep this kind of politics away from the sport.We bopped on the head every offer from No. 10, and we sternly told producers that interview bids for the PM were not allowed.    Evans is seen out and about this week in London. His audience figures dwarf almost all television audiences in this multi-channel world, ex-BBC bigwig Roger Mosey saysIt therefore came as something of a surprise to wake up in my BBC-rented flat in Hackney one morning during the Games to hear David Cameron chirping away happily on the Chris Evans show — and not from Downing Street but from the Olympic Park, where he had been respectfully let in by our security team.There were some perfectly fair questions from his host, but Cameron was living Downing Street\u0027s dream: linking himself with the success of the Games on the nation\u0027s most popular radio show.A good old-fashioned internal BBC row then took place.From Prince Harry to pop queens, he has pulling powerOn our morning editorial conference call with the director-general, the Evans show was in the dock. Decrees of condemnation were issued instant inquests were launched. The circumstances were murky, but it seemed that this was largely Evans\u0027 own initiative.In normal circumstances, we would have been delighted that a presenter had the kind of contacts that could get the prime minister into a peak-time special appearance and, six years on, I would give Evans full credit for that if not for adherence to editorial policy.Evans\u0027 pulling power has continued with Prince Harry as a studio guest announcing the Invictus Games for wounded, injured or sick service personnel and veterans, or helping out with the travel news in contemporary royal fashion, alongside the daily interviews with the more routine kings and queens of pop.BBC bosses are accused of using Katya and Seann Walsh kiss...Convicted sex offender who told vigilantes it \u0027doesn\u0027t...Share this articleInsiders say that it is not always a bed of roses working on the Evans show.His rebelliousness was at its peak in his Radio 1 days when he had a falling out with his boss, whom he nicknamed on air as \u0027the fat controller\u0027.He is reported to have mellowed with age, but \u0027a rollercoaster\u0027 is one description of a typical working day when he moved to Radio 2.Evans drives himself hard and has a head full of creative ideas, and it can be a tough ask for the people charged with turning those into programme items.The bad times could be pretty bad, say some, though characteristically the rewards from Evans were high, too. A team Christmas dinner, at his expense, would shun all the BBC-favoured restaurants around Broadcasting House and be held at a luxurious Heston Blumenthal restaurant instead.Perhaps it\u0027s no surprise that many of Evans\u0027 team are moving with him to Virgin.Mind you, Evans can afford the largesse. His wealth is estimated in the Sunday Times Rich List at more than £50million, and at his peak he was earning more than £2.2m a year from the BBC.

Pictured are pupils with headteacher Dave McPartlin, centreLast month, the school was crowned happiest primary school in Britain as part of the National Happiness Awards, for goodness’ sake.When I meet them, they are also buzzing, fizzing almost, from the excitement of having their first single, Light Up (in aid of the Alzheimer’s Society), in the UK Charts. In recent weeks, dressed as elves, draped in fairy lights and led by their astonishingly energetic head Dave McPartlin, 40, they’ve appeared on The One Show, Sky News, ITN and in newspapers and blogs around the world.They’ve driven hundreds of miles through the night to London to meet Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans as he arrived outside the BBC studio at 5.45am, and were invited on to his show.They’ve sung in schools, care homes and nurseries and assured everyone, everywhere they go, that all they really want for Christmas is ‘to make memories’, to spend time with families and to spread some good in the world.‘Time and memories, that’s what really matters,’ says Grace, ten.So they’d be forgiven for being a teeny bit downcast to have been beaten to the top spot yesterday by a song about sausage rolls, in aid of food banks, with their own single coming up 64th. But not a bit of it.Who wins the Christmas Lunch store wars? How supermarkets...You’re all Christmas stars! Actor Rupert Everett salutes...Share this article‘It doesn’t matter if we don’t make No. 1. Our school’s attitude is not about getting somewhere, it’s about trying to get there,’ explains Ruby, ten, from Year 6.Abbie, also ten, agrees: ‘We tried our hardest and it was fun. We did all we could. You have to take the risk or you lose the chance. So we did.’Such depth of character and stoicism beyond their years.Flakefleet’s big push to top the Christmas pop chart began just four weeks ago.‘Staff thought I’d lost the plot when I said, ‘Let’s go for the Christmas No. 1!’ says head Mr McPartlin. So he put up a new school Facebook page, ‘Flakefleet For Christmas No. 1’, and that was that.He is not the sort to let lack of cash, or any relevant experience, or contacts in the music business, or indeed any knowledge of music at all, to get in the way.‘On reflection, it would have been better if we’d started a couple of weeks earlier,’ he says.The song was written by pupils and teachers along with couple of producers who were friends of friends and helped out for nothing. The recording — featuring all 471 children — took place in a studio lent to the school.          Staff and children from the school have gained media coverage after doorstepping Chris Evans at BBC Radio 2 and were then invited on his show, picturedThe accompanying video — featuring the pupils and residents of Fleetwood Hall Care Home laughing, hugging, whizzing about in wheelchairs and learning to floss-dance on Blackpool promenade — was shot entirely on Mr McPartlin’s iPhone and edited on his home computer one evening.I defy anyone to watch it without laughing, crying and generally feeling happier.There was something so joyful, so uplifting, so happily infectious about Flakefleet’s offering that, despite the odds, it entered the midweek charts at No. 15 last week.‘No. 15! It’s crazy,’ says Mr McPartlin. ‘It’s mad. But it just shows that you can do anything if you try. Anything at all. It didn’t even cost a penny.’Everything necessary to record the song and put this wonderful school on the map has been donated.A local bus company provided transport so the children could zip all over the country to perform.‘Some children had never been to London, so it seemed a shame not to show them around,’ says Mr McPartlin.Fleetwood Town Football Club have been unfailingly supportive. Blackpool Winter Gardens were lent free of charge for Light Up’s official launch. Smart posters, flyers, logo’d T-shirts and sweatshirts have all been given — leaving a whole school room dedicated to publicity.On Thursday lunchtime, I watched a light aircraft trail a jaunty ‘Flakefleet For Christmas No. 1’ banner across the grey skies.‘Fleetwood is a small place, but that’s the only small thing about it,’ the head says.Sadly, no one can donate hours in the day for Mr McPartlin, who has three young children, a long-suffering fiancee Alex (who’s been roped in to help with publicity) and hasn’t done a jot of Christmas shopping.‘The house is a bombsite, we’re eating terrible food and we haven’t watched telly for a month!’ he says. ‘I would dearly love some sleep. I am absolutely exhausted!’But all that, too, bounced off Mr McPartlin as he drove down the M6 to London and back — first with a carload, and later busloads, of kids dressed as singing elves, giving them their first taste of fame. ‘I’m loving every minute,’ he says. ‘Our school motto has even been changed to “Dare to Dream”.‘It used to be “everyone is a learner and every experience is a learning opportunity”. But you have to dream. You have to follow your dreams. The children are already walking taller and prouder. If you look after confidence, resilience and perseverance, the rest will follow.’Mr McPartlin has never been the sort of chap to do things by halves.When Prince Harry and Meghan married in May, the school put on their own mock Royal Wedding.In the summer, Mr McPartlin and his 80-strong staff put on FlakeFest to celebrate the school’s singers, dancers and performers.    The children, pictured recording, say they were not disappointed the single reached no.64 in the charts and added they just wanted to \u0027make memories\u0027‘It shouldn’t just be about classroom learning’ is his philosophy.The ‘happiest school’ accolade was a result of staff routinely going far, far beyond the boundaries of either their job description or the national curriculum.Indeed, sometimes they take pupils’ washing home to do themselves. They provide extra food, where necessary, and supplement missing birthday and Christmas presents — all with the utmost discretion, of course.‘We don’t want to make a song and dance of it,’ he says. ‘It’s just about providing a supportive environment, where our kids can stand a bit taller, a bit prouder. Happy learners have got to be better learners.’The staff posted a video called ‘What teachers do when the kids go home’ — showing them racing about the corridors on their twirly-whirly teacher chairs, playing in the nursery sandpit, climbing trees, having wheelbarrow races and generally goofing about.No wonder the walls are plastered with thank-you notes from grateful parents, eulogising about the brilliant school.The links with Fleetwood Hall Care Home were forged in 2016. There are joint arts and crafts sessions with the school nursery, residents are invited to major school events and, every week, the older children visit. ‘We love it,’ says one of the Year 6 girls. ‘We get to dance and laugh. They are so happy when we arrive. We play games, we chat. We dance.’The impact on the residents is palpable. ‘They’re wonderful children,’ says Dorothy Billington, who is 93 and features on the video. ‘They listen to you. They chat to you. They love you for what you are. Even if you’re old and tired.’ The idea for the song came at the end of the Royal Wedding extravaganza.‘We went back to the staff room and we were giddy with excitement and thought, right, what can we do next?Some might have thought that aiming for a Christmas No. 1 — an achievement most professional pop groups never manage — was a touch ambitious. But, naturally, not Mr McPartlin. ‘I want children to know they can do anything if they throw themselves at and commit to it,’ he says.‘I want them to know they might knock on 1,000 closed doors but that the 1,001st could give them their special break.’He has wanted to be a head teacher since he was a boy. After a childhood in a happy working-class home in Hartlepool, he studied at Durham University. He is exactly the sort of head that every school wants and then worries they’ll manage to keep.Flakefleet is his second headship. He has already helped turn a Church of England primary near Morecambe, Lancashire, from an Ofsted Good to an Outstanding.When he visited Flakefleet, he felt a yearning. ‘I looked around and thought: I want to be your head. Your leader,’ he says simply.After three years, he has already made a huge impact. Not just on the Ofsted results —which are rocketing — but on the children, staff and wider community.          Scenes in the video (seen) show the youngsters dancing with residents at the care home in Lancashire as they enjoy day out          Flakefleet Primary School went viral when pupils staged their own version of Harry and Meghans Royal wedding earlier this year‘I can’t think of a time when I’ve gone home and complained about work the whole time I’ve been here,’ he says. ‘I love our kids. I want them to do well. I really love them.’The kids, meanwhile, are an absolute delight — boisterous and bouncy, as they should be, but also polite and courteous.Two blonde girls approach me unbidden, to say: ‘I hope you’re having a very nice day!’ and, ‘I hope you like our school.’They all adore their head.‘He cries more than us!’ says one of the Year 6 boys.‘And he drinks A LOT of coffee but he’s taught us not to stop and think about things too much before we do them — and just go for it,’ says another. ‘He’s the best head in the world and he’s ours.’Even more surprising, they do, genuinely, appear to believe in his vision.‘Christmas is about family,’ says a boy called Jack.‘For Christmas, I’d like to be able to get along with my brother better,’ says Abbey. ‘We argue all the time.’Sadly, the competition to be Christmas No. 1 was always rather strong.There were rival offerings from global superstars Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Mark Ronson and the inevitable X Factor winner. Also, a host of home-grown charitable songs, including a clutch of handsome firemen, singing for injured firefighters, and a group of organ transplant recipients with a song called Tomorrow.And the favourite: a self-styled ‘dad blogger’ from Nottingham singing a comedy ode to sausage rolls in a parody of Starship’s hit We Built This City, raising money for the Trussell Trust’s network of food banks.So, no, Flakefleet Primary didn’t make it to No. 1. But they have been invited on to next year’s Britain’s Got Talent. And what they did was so much more important. They showed us how to care, to love, to live . . . and to dare to dream."},{"url":null,"title":"More pentagon officials planning resign wake Mattis departure","story":"    Outgoing Secretary of Defense James Mattis (left) make a final attempt Thursday, before resigning, to convince President Donald Trump that it was unwise to pull all of America\u0027s military troops out of SyriaMedia reports Thursday focused on Mattis\u0027 veiled reference to Russia and China in the letter, which explained his belief in \u0027being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors.\u0027Trump defended his record in a tweet: \u0027There has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on China or Russia – Never, just look at the facts. The Fake News tries so hard to paint the opposite picture.\u0027Trum phas been widely criticized for a public soft-glove approach to Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin, taking at face value the former KGB spymaster\u0027s claim that the Kremlin didn\u0027t order digital monkeywrenching campaigns to interfere with the 2016 U.S. elections.At the same time, Mattis has worried that the White House is too aggressive with China and has emphasized the need to repair frayed ties between the two countries\u0027 military forces in order to head off misunderstandings that can quickly metastasize into armed conflicts. Mattis handed Trump his resignation letter at the White House on Thursday during an argument after he realized he couldn\u0027t convince the president to reverse course and leave American troops in Syria, a move that he believes will embolden Russia.His first order of business when he got back to his office was to tell aides to print 50 copies of the letter, ordering them to distribute them as soon as Trump announced his departure.          Farewell to arms? Mattis, a former U.S. Marine Corps general, told aides to print 50 copies of his resignation letter and distribute them to top brass – and the press – as soon as Trump announced his departure          The president insisted Mattis was wrong about his posture toward Russia and China          In his resignation letter, Mattis spelled out his strategic differences and said Trump should find a defense secretary he agrees with moreReporters got the letter at the same time Mattis\u0027 most senior generals did, just minutes after the president tweeted his rose-colored interpretation of the letter\u0027s thinly veiled venom.Hours later, according to officials who spoke to multiple news outlets, Trump ordered a partial withdrawal from Afghanistan, pulling half of the 14,000 U.S. troops out of a conflict he has long claimed America should never have entered.The president asked back in 2011, years before he began to flaunt his political ambitions: \u0027When will we stop wasting our money on rebuilding Afghanistan? We must rebuild our country first.\u0027Mattis, a famously well-read and edurite \u0027warrior-monk,\u0027 wrote in careful prose about America\u0027s failure to tend to its crucial international alliances and partnerships, concluding that Trump should find a replacement whose views aligned more with his own, The president tweeted his thanks for the retired Marine Corps general\u0027s help with \u0027the purchase of new fighting equipment\u0027 and \u0027getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations.\u0027 The White House hasn\u0027t denied that Mattis quit as a direct consequence of Trump\u0027s announcement, over his objections, that America\u0027s troops stationed in Syria would be pulling out. That decision will leave large swaths of Syria unguarded against efforts by Vladimir Putin\u0027s Russia to prop up strongman Bashar al-Assad in his bloody civil war with rebel groups.            Mattis sees Chinese President Xi Jinping as a powerful adversary and blames Trump for not doing more to keep U.S.-China military ties strong in order to pre-empt future conflicts  Taking all of America\u0027s troops out of Syria will leave dictator Bashar al-Assad (left) in a much stronger position with Vladimir Putin of Russia (right) given a free hand to protect him          Mattis was a Marine\u0027s Marine, carrying his own pack as a brigadier general          President Donald Trump reportedly overruled Mattis\u0027 objection this week in deciding to withdraw American troops from SyriaMattis\u0027 written message to Trump didn\u0027t mention the Syria conflict, but its unmistakable flamethrower rhetoric left little doubt. \u0027One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies.\u0027Mattis also declared that America \u0027must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours.\u0027 At the White House, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told a crush of reporters that Mattis made the decision about the timing of his announcement.\u0027He and the president have a good relationship, but sometimes they disagree,\u0027 she acknowledged, responding to a question about the Syria troop pullout\u0027s role in the defense secretary\u0027s departure.\u0027The president always listens to members of his national security team, but at the end of the day, it\u0027s the president\u0027s decision to make,\u0027 she said. \u0027He was the one to be elected president, to be the commander in chief, and while he takes all of their opinions, and all of their advice into consideration, at the end of the day it\u0027s his decision to make.\u0027          Mattis was regarded as a steadying influence on Trump and his departure will leave much of Congress worried about the lack of a check on the president\u0027s more arbitrary impulses          White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders didn\u0027t deny on Thursday evening that Mattis timed his departure to show displeasure with Trump\u0027s decision to withdraw America\u0027s troops from Syria over his objection    The president stunned Washington with his announcement, making it on Twitter instead of in an official statementTrump made waves Wednesday at the Pentagon by announcing his withdrawal of America\u0027s mid-size military contingent stationed in Syria.The decision, reached Tuesday in a small group meeting at the White House, didn\u0027t include consultation with Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were in the room. Both objected. Trump declared this week that his administration has won the war against the ISIS terror army, even though the Pentagon has said the group still has 30,000 soldiers in Iraq and Syria. Reactions to Mattis\u0027 announcement fell along partisan lines on Thursday. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who will become speaker in January, said during a press conference at the Capitol that she was \u0027shaken by the resignation of General Mattis\u0027 and called it \u0027a very sad day for our country.\u0027Pelosi encouraged reporters to read the resignation letter, and to pray for the United States.  \u0027You have leaders, great leaders who have left the administration in dismay and the rest of them have left in disgrace. And that\u0027s what this administration has been about,\u0027 she claimed.Most Republicans thanked the defense secretary for more than 40 years of public service. Many Democrats lamented that one of the Trump administration\u0027s few \u0027adults in the room\u0027 would be leaving.Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said on Twitter: \u0027America has lost more than an exceptional Secretary of Defense. We have lost the adult in the room when the President goes off on a tweet-filled, uninformed rant about our national security.\u0027           California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff will chair the House Intelligence Committee next year he blasted Trump for ignoring Mattis\u0027 advice          Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said the Trump administration has \u0027lost the adult in the room\u0027          Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was among very few Republicans to offer anything but wistful thanks he tweeted that the Mattis resignation letter points to serious flaws in America\u0027s strategic thinking overseasTennessee Rep. Jim Cooper appeared to be tweeting from the same talking points. \u0027I worry the White House meeting rooms will soon be vacant of adults,\u0027 he wrote.California Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez chimed in: \u0027The adults have officially left the building.\u0027Fellow Californian Adam Schiff, who will chair the House Intelligence Committee in 2019 and 2020, took his criticism a step further.\u0027Old Marines never die, but they do resign after the President ignores their advice, betrays our allies, rewards our enemies, and puts the nation\u0027s security at risk. Turn out the lights when Mattis leaves we will not see his like again while Trump remains in office,\u0027 Schiff tweeted. Outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan, a retiring Wisconsin Republican, issued a more traditional statement, saying Mattis has made the nation \u0027a safer America at home, and a more commanding force abroad. His patriotism and grit are matched only by his humility and graciousness.\u0027 On GOP dissenter, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, tweeted that Thursday\u0027s resignation letter \u0027makes it abundantly clear that we are headed towards a series of grave policy errors which will endanger our nation,damage our alliances \u0026amp empower our adversaries.\u0027 Trump\u0027s top general was blindsided by decision to pull out...¿THEY want it.¿ Trump claims troops killed battling ISIS in...Share this article    The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee called Mattis\u0027 planned departure \u0027scary,\u0027 saying the retired general \u0027has been an island of stability\u0027 amid Trump\u0027s chaosTrump has speculated before about how long Mattis might stay in his Cabinet.Asked in October during a \u002760 Minutes\u0027 interview whether his Defense Department chief might be on his way out, he responded: \u0027Well, I don\u0027t know. He hasn\u0027t told me that.\u0027\u0027I have a very good relationship with him. It could be that he is. I think he\u0027s sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth,\u0027 he said. \u0027But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That\u0027s Washington.\u0027 Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner tweeted in horror on Thursday: \u0027This is scary.\u0027 \u0027Secretary Mattis has been an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration. As we\u0027ve seen with the President\u0027s haphazard approach to Syria, our national defense is too important to be subjected to the President\u0027s erratic whims.\u0027Warner is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.Mattis isn\u0027t the only senior official on the way out. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly will depart in a matter of weeks, and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is also on a glide path to the private sector.The president drew cheers at political rallies during his late 2016 transition period when he announced that Mattis would run the Pentagon.Trump was fond of calling him \u0027Mad Dog,\u0027 a nickname Marine lore described as a loving tribute bestowed by the men he led.In fact, his men in the field had a different moniker for him when he was a Marine colonel. They called him CHAOS, short for \u0027Colonel Has An Outstanding Suggestion\u0027–a hat tip to Mattis\u0027 reputation as a thinking man\u0027s soldier.Behind the scenes of the Mattis bombshell: More resignations expected after ¿protest¿ exit | Fox News"},{"url":null,"title":"Theresa host New Years party Downing Street tries schmooze Tory MPs","story":"    Prime Minister Theresa May (pictured above) is set to host a party at Downing streetThe deal is currently being opposed as MPs fear the Irish backstop could trap Britain in the EUs custom union.As it stands Northern Irish MPs won\u0027t accept the plan as it would put checks on some goods travelling between Britain and Northern Ireland.According to The Sun, the Downing Street party is designed to send a clear message to Tory MPs that failure to deliver a Brexit deal could see them booted out of power.Raab is warned Tory Brexit rebels risk tearing the party...EU steps up preparation for No Deal Brexit after telling...\u0027I can\u0027t wait to beat her.

We talked to her about the past 12 months – and she picked out some of her favourite imagesHow would you describe the year from the point of a news photographer?This year has been non-stop but that’s exactly what you want as a news photographer. It keeps you on your toes and pushes you to tell the story in the best possible way.I’ve been lucky enough to be involved in some really interesting stories, including Cambridge Analytica, the Salisbury poisoning, a royal baby, two royal weddings, Donald Trump’s working visit to the UK, the World Cup, the Pope’s visit to Ireland, the migrant caravan in Mexico and, of course, Brexit. Each and every one of them was very different, often challenging but equally as rewarding.What was your favourite assignment?My favourite assignment this year was the World Cup, it was so exciting to be covering a story that had such a global interest, particularly coming from England, where World Cup fever was as big as it was in Russia. Knowing the pictures you’re taking are being seen all over the world is all you want from a story, and the World Cup did exactly that.What is the best image you took or one that touched you – is there a story behind this?My favourite image I took this year was one taken while on my second visit to Mexico covering the migrant caravan. It was the first time in my life I’d seen an actual physical border between two countries. Amazed and fascinated by its existence, I was drawn to spending time at the border fence. It was taken on my first day in Tijuana, I’d been sitting on the beach in front of the fence for about an hour just absorbing my surroundings. It was very busy with locals and tourists enjoying the good weather on the beautiful Mexican beach, so I didn’t expect to witness anything related to the story, but then I spotted a male migrant take his shoes off and he began to climb the fence.It was surreal, I’d travelled over 1,000 km with the caravan as they made their way through Mexico to the US border so that moment and this picture sum up the story for me.Are there any communities that you have made relationships with in your work as a photojournalist?Working with the migrant caravan this year was the most amount of time I’ve spent with any one community as a photojournalist, some of them were wonderful people who were very welcoming. As an outsider looking in, it’s important to build a rapport with people, to be invited into their world because it helps you get the most out of the story.Do you approach stories in a particular way? How do you approach switching between completely different stories and places?The thing I’ve learnt the most about this job is to approach every story with an open mind because you really never know what is going to happen next with it. When people are involved, you just have to let them do their thing and the pictures will follow.One of the best things about this job is the variety that comes with it. Every day is totally different and switching between stories so quickly keeps your mind and your pictures fresh.It’s not unusual to be photographing the prime minister walking out of 10 Downing Street one day and then sat getting wet at Stamford Bridge for a Chelsea game the next, but I wouldn’t want it any other way. I think that says a lot about my attention !Aside from the news-driven material – were there any features in particular that you were most proud of?The feature I shot that I’m most proud of this year is one called: Pride and worry, Britain’s free health service turns 70, the beginning of an ongoing project illustrating life within the NHS. I worked in an NHS hospital while I was studying to become a photographer so it’s something I’d wanted to shoot for quite some time.“I’ve had so many things go wrong with my body in the past four and a half years that it’s just incredible that one organisation can cure so many things and treat me so kindly, efficiently and for free. It’s just astonishing,” said Ritson. He remembers what it was like before the state-funded NHS when healthcare was beyond the reach of many people because they could not afford to pay doctors’ fees.This was the third and final time I was photographing Donald Trump during his working visit to the UK. I’d noticed he had a tendency to hold Theresa May by the hand when they used stairs, so I lay on the floor for 15 minutes waiting for the pair to exit via some steps. As they did, Trump took May by the arm and shouted over his shoulder: “Yes” in response to the question: “Mr President, will you tell Putin to stay out of the US elections?”Rong Lu said she has been coming to the swimming shed for 30 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e817fe46d2d4602936f63c1bd1e396fa96ace6bb/0_367_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7f83dbf3f24f27e1b7989bf034c3888","title":"behold blue plant photograph earthrise","story":"When Bill Anders took this photograph from the Apollo spacecraft on Christmas Eve in 1968, our relationship with the world changed foreverThis photograph is now half a century old. It was taken by the astronaut Bill Anders on Christmas Eve 1968 as the Apollo 8 spacecraft rounded the dark side of the moon for a fourth time. When Earth came up over the horizon, Anders scrabbled for his Hasselblad camera and started clicking.In that pre-digital age, five days passed. The astronauts returned to Earth the film was retrieved and developed. In its new year edition, Life magazine printed the photo on a double-page spread alongside a poem by US poet laureate James Dickey: “And behold  The blue planet steeped in its dream  Of reality, its calculated vision shaking with the only love.”This was not quite the first look at our world from space. Lunar probes had sent back crudely scanned images of a crescent Earth shrouded in cloud. A satellite had even taken a colour photo that, in the autumn of 1968, the radical entrepreneur Stewart Brand put on the cover of his first Whole Earth Catalog. The next edition, in spring 1969, used Anders’s photograph, by now known as Earthrise.Brand’s catalogue was a DIY manual for the Californian counterculture, a crowdsourced compendium of life hacks about backpacking, home weaving, tantra art and goat husbandry. Its one-world, eco ethos was a weird offshoot of the macho tech of the space age – those hunks of aluminium run on rocket fuel and cold war rivalries. But then looking back at Earth was itself a weird offshoot of the moon missions. It just happened that Apollo 8’s aim – to locate the best lunar landing sites – needed high-res photography, which was also good for taking pictures of planets a quarter of a million miles away.Brand was one of a group of environmental activists who felt that an image of “Spaceship Earth” would bring us all together in watchfulness and care for our planetary craft and its precious payload. “Earthrise”, though, did more than just corroborate this gathering mood. With its incontestable beauty, a beauty that had needed no eye of a beholder for billions of years, it caught the human heart by surprise.The Earth pictured in Earthrise looks unlike traditional cartographic globes that mark out land and sea along lines of latitude and longitude. Slightly more than half the planet is illuminated. The line iding night and day severs Africa. Earth looks as if it is floating alone in the eternal night of space, each part awaiting its share of the life-giving light of the sun.Apart from a small brown patch of equatorial Africa, the planet is blue and white. At first glance it seems to have the sheen of blue-veined marble. But look closer and that spherical perfection softens a little. Earth ulges its true state as oceanic and atmospheric, warmly welcoming and achingly vulnerable.The blue is light scattered by the sea and sky. The white is the gaseous veneer that coats our planet and lets us live. You can just make out the “beautiful blue halo”, with its gentle shift from tender blue to purple black, that Yuri Gagarin noticed on his first low-orbit flight. That halo is our fragile biosphere, and is all that stands between us and the suffocating void.Fifty years ago the biochemist James Lovelock was working for Nasa and developing a theory of Earth as a single, self-regulating superorganism. It had reached a homeostatic state conducive to life, he believed, against odds as long as “surviving unscathed a drive blindfold through rush-hour traffic”. Lovelock’s theory, later named Gaia after the Greek goddess of the Earth, makes a special kind of sense when you gaze at our planet from the moon.The poet Archibald MacLeish caught it best for a piece in the New York Times on Christmas Day 1968 – oddly, when only the Apollo 8 crew had seen Earthrise. All MacLeish had to go on was the live television broadcast by the astronauts on 23 December, when Jim Lovell had pointed his camera out of the cabin window and captured a coarse monochrome image of Earth from 175,000 miles away. “To see the Earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats,” MacLeish wrote, “is to see ourselves as riders on the Earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold.”MacLeish had jumped the gun by a few days other writers had anticipated this sight centuries earlier. In his fantastical narrative The Man in the Moon (1638), the author and ine Francis Godwin has his hero fly to the moon in a machine harnessed to a flock of wild swans. As he ascends into space, the world’s landmasses diminish, not just in size but in significance – Africa is “like unto a pear that had a morsel bitten out upon one side of him” – while the ocean seems “like a great shining brightness” and the whole Earth “masks itself with a kind of brightness like another moon”. Godwin grasped that from space Earth would look terraqueous, and far more aqua than terra.In Jules Verne’s Around the Moon (1870), three adventurers, fired to the moon by a giant space gun, look back at Earth and see “its delicate crescent suspended in the deep blackness of the sky” and “its light, rendered blueish by the thickness of its atmosphere”. When the narrator of HG Wells’s The First Men in the Moon (1901) sees Earth from a spaceship, its three-dimensionality starkly reveals itself in the dance of sunlight and shadow on its surface. “The land below us was twilight and vague,” he writes, “but westward the vast grey stretches of the Atlantic shone like molten silver.” These early sci-fi writers guessed correctly that, from space, a world made of water and air would shimmer as if it were alive. They saw Earthrise before the astronauts did.Fanciful space flights, full of backward glances at our world, occur in very ancient texts. The lesson is always the same: don’t imagine you matter. The vastness of the world, which renders your own life so little, is itself a speck of dust adrift in the vast cathedral of space. Cicero’s Republic imagines the dead Roman general Scipio Africanus, hero of the second Punic war, appearing to his grandson, Scipio Aemilianus, in a dream. The younger Scipio finds himself in the heavens gazing down on Carthage, which he will later destroy in the third Punic war. The world has shrunk to the point where he is “scornful of our empire, which covers only a single point upon its surface”.“O how ridiculous are the boundaries of mortals!” wrote Seneca, imagining Earth from the same cosmic perspective. A fable by the second-century satirist Lucian of Samosata tells of a “sky-man” who flies to the moon. Looking back at Earth, he sees “how little there was for our friends the rich to be proud of … The widest-acred of them all had not a single Epicurean atom under cultivation.”The ancients knew how minuscule our preoccupations would seem from afar. The whole earthers of the 1960s thought that photographic proof might help us to see this obvious truth in new ways. Border disputes, imperial wars, the enslavement of other peoples, the spoiling of the planet for selfish and ephemeral gain: all would be exposed as what the cosmologist Carl Sagan called “the squabbles of mites on a plum”.And yet, to a mite, that plum is everything. The power of Earthrise as an image derived partly from its being a picture of the plum taken by a mite – one of the first three to escape the plum’s gravity. With the brown-grey desert of the moon as contrast, the Earth shone as if alert to its singularity. As Marina Benjamin writes in her book Rocket Dreams (2003), this made it “difficult not to imbue the planet with exemplariness”.Earthrise was edited for anthropocentric ends. The Apollo 8 crew saw Earth to the side of the moon, not above it, and to them it seemed tiny. Anders compared it to being “in a darkened room with only one visible object, a small blue-green sphere about the size of a Christmas-tree ornament”. Nasa flipped the photo so that Earth seemed to be rising above the moon’s horizon, and then cropped it to make Earth look bigger and more focal. Earthrise was an Earth selfie, taken by earthlings.Since 1968 the earthlings have had many visual reminders of their cosmic irrelevance. Their home planet has been demoted to what Sagan called the “pale blue dot”, the tiny fleck of Earth, no bigger than a pixel, in a photo of our galaxy taken in 1990 by the Voyager 1 probe from 3.7bn light years away.But we prefer to ignore the evidence. In our daily lives we are all flat earthers. We carry on thinking that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Nor is our stewardship of the planet any less culpably forgetful. We still squabble over the juiciest bits of the plum we still fight and die over its pinprick empires the rich and powerful seem more ludicrously puffed-up than ever.Did the 22-year-old Donald Trump, when he first saw Earthrise, feel awed and humbled by human smallness? I’m guessing no. Our species is just as venal and measly-minded as it was half a century ago. Perhaps more so, now that the technology that excites us is not the rocket blasting us into deep space, but the computer coding that blasts us through a wormhole into cyberspace: a human-built universe composed of our own self-admiring obsessions, exhilarating and exhausting enough to fill a lifetime.Still, Earthrise must have changed something. What’s seen can’t be unseen. Perhaps it flits across your mind when you open Google Earth and see that familiar virtual globe gently spinning. Just before you click and drag to fly yourself to some portion of the world no bigger than an allotment, you may briefly take in, with a little stomach lurch, that this slowly revolving sphere holds close to 8 billion people, living out lives as small and short and yet meaningful as the universe is infinite and eternal and yet meaningless. On that gigantic, glistening marble, mottled with blue-white swirls, lies everyone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6a082b79215f8313c3692faf066c183460f63b/66_461_5720_3433/master/5720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=284ce619486d05a52d395870839418a7","title":"buy your own guardian classic photograph cumbrian shepherd 1990","story":"This week in our regular series of exclusive  print sales is a shepherd with his flock in Cumbria, by  photographer Denis Thorpe photographer Denis Thorpe was on a whirlwind tour of Cumbria in November 1990, documenting the activities of rural communities with the then Countryside Commission, when he chanced upon a pair of shepherds bringing their sheep down from the hills – a ritual known as “the gather”, says Thorpe. “I was lucky to be there at the moment they came through the gate – I felt I’d captured the animals’ breath in the cold air.” It was a beautiful composition, he says: the shepherd with his stick, the dry stone wall, the sheep. “It couldn’t be anywhere but the north of England.” Hannah BoothBuy your exclusive print herePrintsPhotographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100+ years.

Now, he is Washington’s version of Elvis Presley on Ed Sullivan, only the screaming teeny-boppers are Beltway politicos: one rainmaker touted him as “Obama, but white”, a Wall Street-funded group called Third Way declared that “we are big Beto fans” and a former Obama aide penned an entire love letter touting O’Rourke 2020, without even once mentioning where the Texas congressman stands on a single legislative issue.Perhaps the fuzziness around O’Rourke’s political positions isn’t a mistake. Maybe it is designed to obscure facts about his record that may prove to be inconvenient in a Democratic primary. After all, this is a lawmaker who abruptly backed off unequivocally supporting Medicare for All, aligned himself with the party’s Wall Street faction, voted to gut financial regulations, supported Republican-crafted tax cuts, boosted the fossil fuel industry – and then broke his own pledge to reject donations from oil and gas executives. The 46-year-old O’Rourke has racked up a voting record helping Republicans ram parts of their agenda through the Congress. In an era of growing economic inequality, O’Rourke has split with the majority of his party to vote for Republican initiatives to weaken Wall Street regulations and accelerate bank mergers – and he once voted for a Republican bill that Democratic legislators said was designed to block the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s from combatting racially discriminatory lending. He also voted for a key part of Donald Trump’s so-called deportation force.Meanwhile, despite the imminent climate catastrophe facing our planet, O’Rourke has often taken the side of carbon polluters. He has repeatedly voted to help the fossil fuel industry increase its exports. He even helped the GOP defeat a Democratic measure designed to limit the possibility of offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. (For more, click here to read a story I wrote this week about Beto’s voting record.)The big story here is not just O’Rourke’s record – but also the unstated message of the substance-free hype surrounding his potential presidential candidacy.In light of O’Rourke’s voting record, Betomania signals that Democratic power players are not first and foremost searching for candidates whose records prove they are committed to a set of policies that will address the emergencies facing America and the world. Instead, they are frantically seeking a new version of Barack Obama – a conflict-averse politician who proudly boasted of being “a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views”.Replicating an Obama presidency would be better than what we have now. But it would still be a tragedy. That’s because the fundamental premise of Obamaism - and its predecessor, Clintonism – is that there is always a policy that can at once serve the people and the powerful. And recent history has showed that is both false and dangerous.The fantastical mythology of a satisfactory “third way” between the corporate class and the rest of us posits that the Democratic party’s insurance industry backers can be enriched and healthcare policy can still be humane its Wall Street sponsors can eviscerate industries and workers can still earn enough to survive and its fossil fuel donors can keep pumping out carbon and the ecosystem can still sustain human life.The alluring idea is that we never actually have to answer that haunting question of labor lore: “Which side are you on?” Obamaism leads us to believe that we do not need to choose, and that we can actually have it all – as long as we always make sure to line up behind policies that appease the super-wealthy.It is, in other words, the ideology undergirding the argument recently put forward by former vice-president, Joe Biden, who insisted: “I don’t think 500 billionaires are the reason why we’re in trouble … the folks at the top aren’t bad guys.”It is easy to understand the political utility of this third-way legend: it lets Democrats continue raising gobs of cash from satisfied corporate donors and moguls, and it at least provides voters with more palatable rhetoric than what the Republican party offers. And yet the record of third-way policies over the past few years have made painfully clear that Obamaism’s refusal to choose a side can be a nihilistic choice unto itself.Obamacare, for instance, posited that we do not have to choose between profits and human lives, and that no matter what, we must avoid antagonizing the healthcare industry with ideas like Medicare for All. The policy assumes that the healthcare industry can still hit paydirt in a system that also provides all Americans with decent medical care.Eight years into the experiment, the industry has indeed been raking in record profits, and health insurance CEOs were paid more than $340m in 2017 alone. At the same time, 27 million people are uninsured, millions more are struggling to afford medical care and prescription drugs, and patients still face the threat of insurance industry death panels cutting off their benefits. The situation is now so dire that one out of every three GoFundMe campaigns are fundraising drives to pay medical bills – all while former Obama aides get hired to help the insurance industry block Medicare for All in the new Congress.When it came to economic inequality, Obamaism similarly sought a third way between the super-rich and everyone else.It was bailouts for bankers and support for a slightly higher minimum wage. It was an economic stimulus bill, but also a proposal to slash social security benefits. It was a few actions to strengthen workplace protections, but abandoning a drawn-out fight for laws strengthening unions. It was a modest uptick in antitrust enforcement, but doing little to systematically hinder monopolization, which has given corporate behemoths more market power to prevent wage increases. It was slapping a few fines on Wall Street firms after the financial crisis, but refusing to prosecute top financial executives – a policy enshrining de facto legal immunity for a predatory banking industry that fleeces workaday Americans.And when it came to the environment, Obamaism presumed that we do not have to choose between ExxonMobil and a habitable ecosystem. Obama’s particular third way on energy policy was somewhat tougher emissions and efficiency standards and yet also strong support for more drilling, fracking and fossil fuel exports (Weeks after a recent scientific report warning of catastrophic climate change, Obama told an audience that he should be thanked because “suddenly America is the largest oil producer – that was me, people”.)Heading into the 2020 presidential election, O’Rourke’s soaring speeches and charisma may suggest he would offer a better version of this dangerous form of corporate fealty – but in Congress, his votes tell a different story. His telegenic brand seems to offer the same blank screen as Obama – and his record offers the same third-way ideology.Of course, another third-way presidency – whether in the form of O’Rourke or some other stalking horse – would save us from more Trump. But here’s the thing: it would almost certainly still be death.More healthcare policy that coddles profiteers will mean yet more riches for insurance executives, and yet more desperation, suffering and casualties for everyone else. Another Democratic president who appeases the corporate lobby by avoiding bare-knuckled brawls over wages, union rights and monopoly power will be another four years marked by more crushing poverty that wipes out entire communities. More Obamaism intent on further increasing fossil fuel production will deliver something between a holocaust and a full-fledged mass extinction, according to climatologists.The math and science of this reality is tough to explicitly dispute, and so as they now gear up to influence the 2020 presidential primary, the Beltway crowd has been rolling out new tactics to pursue their fever dream of an Obama clone.One such tactic is hawking their agenda of corporate appeasement as a Democratic party necessity to attract independent voters in an allegedly conservative country. To win, the party must “affirm core American beliefs in free enterprise, inidual initiative and self-reliance and put strengthening markets’ ability to provide broader opportunities before government redistribution”, wrote two officials of the Progressive Policy Institute, a deceptively titled thinktank for pro-business Democrats.Amid this shift in public opinion, environmental, labor and economic justice movements now threaten to take over the Democratic party. And so another tactic of the status quo crowd has been saccharine demands for comity. This rhetorical maneuver was best summarized by a recent Boston Globe editorial deriding firebrand Senator Elizabeth Warren: the screed decried the outspoken Wall Street critic as too “isive” for the presidency, and called instead for “a unifying voice”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c74735ccf6155048d7e1c157e659edb8fab6fd0/0_170_3753_2252/master/3753.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32ec6279976e322bf655c2c10868cb51","title":"christmas long drive stubbornness","story":"The long drive, the cold pork, the room full of older strangers … this is where my stubbornness had led usIt was all my fault. It usually is. When you’re married with young children but still haven’t managed the transition to hosting Christmas yourself, the question of whose parents you join for Christmas can be a tense one. And here’s the thing. I was determined that fairness meant we would alternate: Christmas day with my wife’s parents one year, and with my own the next.So there was this one year when Alice’s parents were coming down from Northumberland, where they live, to London, where we live, to spend Christmas with her two sisters and their partners and kids – right round the corner from us. But, dammit, it was MY year.It occasioned what I’m pretty sure is the longest marital argument we’ve had. It started in mid-August, and reached a rolling boil on Christmas morning. But there were various peaks and troughs. It became clear, for instance, in the run-up to the big day, that we were out of sync with most of my own siblings – so rather than have a full complement of Leiths around the brussels sprouts, we’d be a thinner crowd. And my mum and dad said they didn’t mind much if we all got together on another day. But I was adamant. It had to be Christmas. Christmas day was different. It was a point of principle.Still, because Alice’s parents live much farther away and were only going to be in town for a few days, and were in any case staying with us, I grudgingly conceded that it wouldn’t be the end of the world if we just went home for Christmas day itself. Christmas lunch itself. But that was my Theresa May-style red line. We would, one way or another, spend Christmas lunch with my family. It was only fair.And by this stage, friends, I was sticking to my guns. In fact, I was gorilla-glued to my guns. Even when it became clear that, rather than host Christmas lunch at the family home, my folks had decided that, what with only two of their children’s families coming, they’d drive over and join my auntie’s Christmas party at her house in Gloucestershire. Well, I adore my auntie, as all right-thinking nephews do, and it might besides be a rare chance to see my cousins, so dammit that’s where we’d go. Oh. One or both of the cousins had made other arrangements? NEVER MIND.So, on Christmas morning, in a mood that has (ever since my late grandmother single-handedly lifted a car out of a ditch in a seasonal rage) been known in my family as “Christmassy”, we bid goodbye to my parents-in-law, and my sisters-in-law, and my children’s closest cousins. We left them in a cosy room, aglow with the soft light of the Christmas tree, and scattered with presents, and warm with good cheer, and 10 minutes from our house. We loaded the children into our car and set off on the two-and-a-half-hour drive to my aunt’s house.I can’t remember, mercifully, the conversation we had on the way. But it was not such as is commonly carolled in the sentimental stories of Yuletide. I think words such as “orce” and “drive me home this instant” and “worst Christmas ever” and “stop the car” were merrily exchanged as we barrelled along first the motorway, and then the icy and deserted country lanes.But nobody actually jumped out of the car, and what with all the adult shouting the children were traumatised enough to behave themselves, and we finally rocked up at my aunt’s. Which – she being a great hostess – was not an intimate family lunch but a stand-up-and-stroll-about party for about 50 people, all of them very nice but most of them a generation older and unknown to us. And she’d decided that instead of doing turkey we’d all have slow-cooked shredded shoulder of pork and apple sauce in pancakes an Anglo-Saxon riff on the Chinese duck classic, I suppose.Which would have been fine – except that they’d had a bit of a disaster (someone had innocently turned the oven off that morning) so the meltingly slow-cooked pork was now sliced pork emergency flash-fried by hand. And it was buckwheat pancakes – which, it turns out, are hard to keep warm if you’re cooking for dozens of people. So there we stood: eating toughish, coldish pork out of softish, coldish pancakes, standing up surrounded by strangers, and sober because driving. And after that we had to turn round and spend another two and a half hours in the car.But you know what? The orce never took place. My wife was so pleased to have been proved right that all her rancour and resentment melted away, and we laughed together all the way home.• Sam Leith is literary editor of the Spectator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/895662bd35c5e31b72e22e4ac359ed23aabe51c7/0_44_3061_1836/master/3061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82dcb0e431659b8918e1533d3d7e1a33","title":"gemma collins ice maiden cometh extra chutzpah","story":"Having starred in many a reality TV show, she’s now honing her spins and axelsIt doesn’t start until January, but naturally the star of the new Dancing on Ice is already Gemma Collins, who has been doling out the kind of pre-match fighting talk that should have her rivals skating for the nearest dressing room. “Just think Beyoncé on ice, honey,” she told the Mirror, of what she had in store for the competition. “That’s me. Beyoncé for the first week, Mariah for the second, Celine Dion for the third, and then full GC for the fourth.”Collins, who made her name on The Only Way Is Essex, is about to complete whatever the Emmy-Grammy-Oscar-Tony equivalent of reality shows is, having appeared on just about all of them, even that one where celebrities had to learn to e that was about as exciting as watching people learn how to e.I only regret that she never managed to do The Jump, for which I had a soft spot – it got famous people to compete in winter sports, only to find that such activities required a touch more expertise than expected, as 34 of its 60 competitors were injured. It upped the stakes of celebrity reality TV eating a bull’s penis in the jungle no longer seemed so horrific next to the very probable prospect of snapping a ligament in a snowsuit while attempting to jump in the air. Oddly enough, it was axed after four series, so Dancing on Ice, in which celebrities can spend weeks avoiding a broken ankle and trying to pretend they’re not wishing they’d done Strictly instead, will have to do.Collins is such excellent value that it’s little wonder they finally signed her up. She is a walking headline generator and guaranteed entertainment. She made Celebrity MasterChef a talking point by getting someone else to do the cooking for her. She turned her series of Celebrity Big Brother into a timeless content farm for makers of memes (or, in Collins speak, “memés”). She is clearly self-aware, but seems to lack self-awareness entirely, too, and there is something infectious about her absolute over-the-top confidence.“Opening night, I want to do the splits. I want to do a couple of spins, I want to do fireworks,” she says in the promo video, before stumbling around like Bambi on the Baileys. Fellow contestant Brian McFadden has revealed that Collins has been blocked from their WhatsApp group twice for rudeness, but when you’ve got a personality this size, what emojis could possibly contain you? “I’ve asked for grade A Swarovski crystals and as many feathers as they can find,” she has said. Princess, crown, clinking champagne glasses.There were few comedies darker than Sacha Baron Cohen’s Who Is America?, in which the comedian prostheticised – OK, not a word, unless we’re playing Scrabble and it’s my go – himself into a series of increasingly absurd and provocative characters.He did this either to take advantage of his victims’ openness and goodwill or to expose the hypocrisy of people in power who happily condone things such as arming children, depending on which side you took. I found it too bleak to enjoy and often watched with a wince. It made Chris Morris tricking celebrities into campaigning against the fake drug “cake” look like a fuzzy warm remnant of spoofs gone by.In an excellent interview with Deadline, Baron Cohen revealed that he would be unable to make another series for at least 10 years, because his cover was blown. “We relied on the fact that no one was expecting me. I hadn’t done anything undercover for over a decade and so nobody thought, ‘Wait a minute, is this a Sacha Baron Cohen character?’ That’s the problem,” he explains.He also reveals what happened when he tricked Sarah Palin into an interview. Palin, you might remember, wrote a lengthy Facebook post before the show aired, denouncing his sense of humour as “evil, exploitative, sick” and calling him “shallow Sacha boy”, all but guaranteeing publicity for the series. It was, it turns out, entirely in vain. “She was just delivering these kind of rote answers, as if she was doing a campaign speech,” he said. “Even though I sat with her I think for about two-and-a-half hours, there was no comedy gold.” She never even appeared on the show.Danny Dyer is continuing his inevitable bid for an official role in the future of this nation by going up against the Queen to deliver the Alternative Christmas Message on Channel 4.He is, after all, of royal descent, so it seems only fitting that he rises to the challenge of talking some fackin sense. Over the crumbs of a festive feast, he will deliver a short speech in which he reflects on the political year gone by, an annus horribilis on which few will be able to look back with undiluted pleasure.Dyer is a strong choice for this ceremonial role. He voted Leave, but has changed his mind since, famously calling David Cameron a “twat”, twice, live on television, as Piers Morgan snivelled: “I think you’re referring to our former prime minister.” Dyer will discuss the importance of having someone to look up to, like his mentor, Harold Pinter, and will return to politics on Christmas Day, labelling Donald Trump an “absolute melt”, while showering disdain on our own politicians. “That shambles down in Westminster, what a palaver that is. I mean where are our leaders? Where are they?” At this point of the year, that’s looking like insightful political analysis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb8141c319ad82779a12c58303a04b3175728596/0_63_5906_3546/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ddf44983f33311db6eea6465a6ceb53","title":"metoo movement office parties decline weinstein moonves","story":"A decline in office parties has been blamed on the movement – but educating people about consent and boundaries is empowering for everyoneThe Week in Patriarchy is a weekly roundup of what’s happening in the world of feminism and sexism. If you’re not already receiving it by email, make sure to subscribe.No office holiday party this year? Blame #MeToo.While #MeToo has helped topple predators and usher in new laws, it has also increased workplace paranoia. Cancelled office parties are just one example of this a recent Bloomberg investigation found male Wall Street executives are now going out of their way not to be alone with female colleagues, avoiding one-on-one meetings and dinners. (Bloomberg calls this the “Mike Pence” effect, as the vice-president never dines alone with a woman who isn’t his wife.) It shouldn’t need to be said, but apparently it does: #MeToo doesn’t mean gender segregation. It doesn’t mean an end to socializing or fun. It definitely doesn’t mean everyone needs to start acting like Pence. On the contrary, educating people about consent and creating working environments in which there are clear boundaries around behavior, is empowering for everyone.And if you still need persuading that firm boundaries makes for a fun night out, I suggest you take a look at the House of Yes. Voted by Time Out as the second best thing to do in the world, the Brooklyn venue has been described as “the wildest night club on the planet”. A night at House of Yes might involve anything from naked hot tubs to drag wrestling to cage dancers – but it also involves adhering to a strict consent policy. The moment you buy a ticket you are told about this and you are reminded of it throughout the venue. Not just through posters but through “consenticorns” so-called “consent s” who wear light-up unicorn horns.“They wander around the room all night and serve two roles,” explained Jacqui Rabkin, marketing director at House of Yes. “They step in if they see a situation where someone looks uncomfortable or too drunk, and if ask if they need help.” Then, she says, because “they have a light-up headpiece, they also act like a beacon”. If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation you can quickly find a consent  all of whom have been trained in de-escalation techniques.With #MeToo setting off a Pence effect, House of Yes’s success is an important reminder that the stricter we are about consent, the more fun everyone can have. Rather than cancelling holiday parties, companies should be working hard to create a culture where everyone feels safe. They should fix the problem, not try and avoid it. That fix might not involve light-up unicorn horns, but it does involve talking about how we talk about consent.The criminal case against Weinstein will move forward, ruled a New York judge on Thursday.

They are adding meanders where before there were none, to slow the water’s flow, prevent flooding and improve habitats for wildlife.This means that finally, after decades of neglect, our waterways – from the mightiest rivers to the tiniest rivulets – are on the mend. By adding complexity to these linear corridors, which help creatures move from one place to another, riverine wildlife is now returning to areas where it has long been absent.When I was growing up during the 1970s and early 1980s, many of Britain’s rivers and streams were being “improved”. This involved straightening out meanders, dredging the river beds and removing vegetation from the banks so that the water could flow more easily.Meanwhile, many of our larger rivers, such as the Thames and Tyne, were still suffering from the effects of more than a century of pollution from heavy industry. And the marshy land on either side – the flood plain that used to contain the water if a river burst its banks – was often drained, reclaimed and used for housing or industry.The results were catastrophic. Not only did wildlife suffer but the faster flow hugely increased the risk of flooding in towns and cities downstream. This, as we are only too aware, has led to massive costs in terms of loss of life and damage to property.Fortunately, there is now a consensus across communities, water and insurance companies, engineers and conservationists that we need to put back complexity into our river systems, as is now being done in the New Forest.This has already happened elsewhere. A few years ago, I took a walk along a chalk stream in Dorset with a river keeper. He proudly pointed out the array of wildlife on his patch, including kingfishers, dragonflies and damselflies, as well as his precious trout. He then told me that the digger driver who had helped put back the meanders, creating so many improvements for wildlife, was the very same man who had straightened the river in the first place, decades before.Elsewhere in southern Britain, a natural approach is being used to rewild our rivers and streams. Beavers, known as “nature’s architects”, can transform a dull, straight watercourse into a haven for wildlife in a matter of months. With thriving populations now at large in Devon, Somerset and the Forest of Dean, it is surely only a matter of time before these ingenious mammals are being used as a conservation tool, to improve our waterways right across the nation.Sadly, there is still plenty of resistance to the idea that we should slow the flow of streams and rivers, especially from farmers, who wrongly fear that by retaining water upstream, their own land might be inundated. After the widespread flooding in my home county of Somerset, during the winter of 2013-14, the kneejerk response was to call for rivers to be dredged. Yet that would have allowed the water to run downstream even faster and exacerbate the very problem it was trying to solve.Even when rivers can be enhanced, they still face dangers. These include the long-term runoff from agricultural fertilisers, insidiously polluting the water, and one-off incidents involving chemical spillages, which can destroy an entire community of wildlife in a matter of hours. Now we face the threat of climate change and a likely rise in summer droughts, along with the increased demand for water to serve a growing population.But at a time when so much of the wider countryside is being degraded in the headlong rush to produce higher yields of food, or destroyed by vanity projects such as the HS2 rail link, it is good to know that our rivers and streams – and their wildlife – are in a better place than they have been for a very long time.• Stephen Moss is a naturalist and author based in Somerset.

Once located on paper, long-remembered names jump from the map: Nuthanger Farm, Ashley Warren and Honeycomb are all there. It was the multitude of rabbits found on this little square of England that inspired Adams to write Watership Down.The book, and the 1978 film that followed, famously terrified a generation. Instead of fluffy bunnies living in a rural idyll, Adams’s rabbits were both calculated killers and senselessly slaughtered. It was red in tooth and claw, and in the case of the film, shown in glorious and brutal Technicolor.But with a new BBCNetflix adaptation apparently taking a gentler tone, what is the reality for the UK’s rabbit population?For Dr Diana Bell, a rabbit disease expert at the University of East Anglia, it’s pretty dire. “Rabbits may be at an all time low” she says. “When did you last see a roadkill rabbit? You don’t anymore – they simply aren’t around like they used to be”On Watership Down itself, rabbits are certainly hard to come by. The Warren, a deep combe set into the Down, is pockmarked with burrows, but an hour’s watching reveals just four rabbits.Although there are fewer rabbits, the landscape does bear marks of the book. The huge beech tree that sheltered the Watership Down warren was a landmark for many years. “People used to really care about that tree,” says local resident Bryan. “One lady even made her husband drive three hours from Cheshire in the great storm of 1987 just to check it was all right”.The tree finally blew down in 2004, and a newly planted sapling stands in its place – ironically, fenced to protect it from rabbit damage. The names of two of Adams’s rabbit creations, Fiver and Hazel, are scratched into the fencing, the most bucolic of graffiti.Locals out on the hill have started to notice the lack of rabbits too.“Numbers have definitely gone down over the 18 years I’ve been here,” Bryan says, “I think some of that is environmental, but we still see a fair few rabbits with myxie which seems to come and go”Myxomatosis, or myxie, is a disease every bit as horrific as anything in Adams’s book, and it almost wiped out the UK’s rabbit population in the 1950s. The population bounced back, but new strains still affect the rabbits from time to time.For Bell, a newer, silent killer is even more worrying. “Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) first arrived here from China in the early 90s” she says, “and our rabbits were just starting to recover when a new strain appeared in 2010, RHDV2, which has been causing havoc ever since.”The big problem is that while myxomatosis has very obvious symptoms, RHDV2 leaves very little trace.“Rabbits that die from RHDV2 tend to look absolutely fine, so no one reports them” explains Bell, “and one key final stage of the disease is lethargy – so many simply crawl into their burrows and die underground”.As rabbits are subterranean and mostly nocturnal, it is difficult to get a good estimate of their numbers. However, when myxomatosis ravaged the population in the 1950s, buzzards, foxes and stoats all declined along with their main food source, so it is clear a decline in rabbit numbers has effects right up the food chain.But the same is also true down the food chain, and the distinctive chalk grassland of Watership Down relies on the rabbits to keep it maintained.Without the rabbits keeping the grasses down, the landscape so memorably brought to life by Adams might cease to exist too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72ba05d1a4db6d2f8266a2116feb925ac826157d/0_0_2640_1302/master/2640.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d799e7a95aefc821e54f421be0f954a1 1320w","title":"tell us what was your favourite film of 2018","story":"As we reveal our number one film, we want to hear what you’ve been watching on the big screen and why it was memorable After counting down the 50 best films of the year,  critics voted for Roma, Alfonso Cuarón’s memoir of growing up in early 70s Mexico City film, as their standout of 2018 – a “great piece of storytelling with inspired and surreal setpieces and electrifying sequences”.But a list of 50, even separate ones for the US and the UK, will inevitably miss out some of the films you consider worthy of a place this year.So tell us, what have we missed?Tell us about your favourite film of 2018 and why you are voting for it in the form below, including the moment or plot point you think was most memorable.

Because the fact is, all of those annually, if bafflingly, popular suggestions are wrong. A true Christmas movie must adhere to the following scientific, mathematical and logical rules:1 It can’t just be set at Christmas, it has to be about Christmas.2 It would feel extremely wrong to watch it at any other time of year.3 It must leave you feeling – in some seemingly subjective but actually very objective way – Christmassy.This is why Die Hard is not a true Christmas movie. Yes, everyone and their gran loves Die Hard, but it is no more a Christmas movie than Lethal Weapon, or Eyes Wide Shut, or Diner – all of which, like Die Hard, are set at Christmas, and none of which, like Die Hard, are about Christmas. I have no problem with watching Die Hard (or Lethal Weapon, or Diner) at Christmas – if anything, their lack of festivity can be a palate cleanser, a satsuma among all the stilton. But consider what Die Hard’s happy ending actually is: it’s not Hans Gruber falling out of a window and it’s not the good people of the Nakatomi corporation getting out of the building alive. It’s the nice cop Al getting over his fear of guns after “accidentally killing a 13-year-old” (so inconvenient) and, in the final scene, shooting a man dead. So someone from the LAPD has learned to kill again. Does that make you feel Christmassy, people? No, it does not.But the real reason Die Hard is not a Christmas movie is that it can be watched at any time of year. For the same reason, Trading Places is not, ultimately, a Christmas movie, as much as we all enjoy the sight of Dan Aykroyd eating fish out of his Santa beard. But it’s not on any level about Christmas, which is why I can and do watch it all year. And before all the diehard Die Hard fans start throwing Quality Street at me in protest, you should know that both of these movies were originally released in the US in the middle of the summer – so not even the film-makers thought they were Christmas movies. So there.Edward Scissorhands, by contrast, is a Christmas movie, thanks to the Christmas-setting climax, the Winona-dancing-in-the-snow scene and Danny Elfman’s pleasingly spooky-but-festive soundtrack. For me, it’s in the same category as Meet Me In St Louis and It’s A Wonderful Life: none of these movies are explicitly Christmassy in the way White Christmas, Elf, A Christmas Story or Miracle On 34th Street are, but they all have a definite Christmas feel to them, one that is based more on the holiday’s wintry darkness than its neon lights. Bad Santa, and to a certain degree Gremlins, also belong in this group, although in both of them the darkness is less delicate and more, shall we say, scatalogical.Which brings me to Home Alone. Now, Home Alone is certainly a Christmas movie. Indeed, that a film about an eight-year-old who is neglected by his parents and then pursued in his own home by two psychopaths is considered a feelgood comedy, as opposed to a horror movie, really is a testament to the power of the Christmas setting. But whereas John Hughes’ other explicitly festive movie, Planes, Trains And Automobiles, says something joyful, sad and true about the holidays (Thanksgiving, in that case), Home Alone just feels hollow. It was a movie written on autopilot, without any of the soulfulness of Hughes’ previous films, such as Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. After Hughes died in 2009, his former muse, Molly Ringwald, wrote this about his later films, including Home Alone: “They were funny, yes, wildly successful, to be sure, but I recognised very little of the John I knew in them, of his youthful, urgent, unmistakable vulnerability. It was like his heart closed.” A real Christmas movie must have its heart very open.This is why the greatest Christmas movie is The Muppet Christmas Carol. It was the first Muppet movie released after the death of the Muppets creator, Jim Henson, and it was made with palpable love and care by his son, Brian. Almost all the old Muppeteers helped him, save for one: Richard Hunt, who voiced Statler, Beaker and others, died from HIVAids the year before the film came out. It is dedicated to both Hunt and Henson, and is infused with a sense of wistfulness, but also hope for the future – in that it disproved some people’s fears over whether the Muppets could continue after Henson’s death. I’ve watched this film every Christmas for two and a half decades – on my own in India, with friends in Thailand, with my parents in London, and now with my own children – and every time it makes me happy and teary and full of joy, just as Christmas should.But if anyone puts on Love Actually, I will genuinely smack them in the face."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec64e94952dc218a30dc81d22cd51e509357b912/796_709_2706_1623/master/2706.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bc50ba3e1cb542417b1adaca28034ea","title":"wonky spuds tesco selling reject potatoes christmas","story":"Tesco accepts ‘reject’ potatoes after worst growing conditions in 40 yearsThe worst growing conditions in more than 40 years have brought misery for Britain’s potato farmers this year. Freezing spring temperatures in parts of the country, followed by the summer drought – the worst since 1976 – have hit growers across the country and threatened to put some out of business altogether.Now, however, comes a rare piece of good news for the industry. Tesco is relaxing its stringent guidelines governing the size and shape of potatoes to ensure a decent supply over Christmas. The supermarket giant has already taken delivery of some 4,000 tonnes of spuds that it would normally reject.“We’ve worked with our potato growers to use as much of the crop and prevent perfectly good spuds from going to waste,” said Rob Hooper, Tesco’s potato expert. “We want to support our growers wherever we can – and although some potatoes might be smaller and larger, they still pack the same great taste our customers expect.”More than a third of farmed fruit and vegetables never reaches supermarket shelves because it is misshapen or the wrong size, according to research published in August by the University of Edinburgh. It found that more than 50 million tonnes of produce grown across Europe is discarded each year.Supermarkets including Morrisons and Waitrose were last week reported to have increased their efforts to reduce the national food waste mountain at Christmas by offering shoppers edible produce nearing the end of its shelf life, as well as “wonky” sprouts, carrots and parsnips.The Observer reported in April that farmers were having to delay sowing their potato seeds because of the late spring snow, and that diffiuclt weather conditons had pushed the harvesting of the nation’s asparagus back weeks. Then a sustained heatwave played further havoc with growing conditions, compounding problems for potato farmers.The shortage became so dire in the late summer that the major supermarkets had to import tonnes of potatoes from other European countries.“The extreme cold of the Beast from the East delayed planting in the spring, then the extended heat and drought of the summer impacted on crop growth and development,” said Sharon Affleck, sales and marketing director at Branston, one of the UK’s largest potato packers, which handles about 350,000 tonnes a year.“Potatoes need a good water supply to help them to grow evenly and bulk up, especially when it’s hot. This means that the fresh potatoes available to pack are generally smaller, and the shape and skin finish is not as smooth as consumers may be used to.”The widening of the specifications, which will remain in place until June when the first of the new season’s crop comes in, has been welcomed by farmers.“It continues to be critically important that retailers provide flexibility on specifications during difficult growing seasons in order for British farmers to do what they do best – producing food for the nation,” said the NFU’s chief horticulture adviser Lee Abbey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e338e7bbbdc2046f4ea359f4423c3b38c9583f23/0_41_2020_1212/master/2020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7306a2aa65a358667df3547b66e76e07","title":"celtic dundee scottish premiership match report","story":"Mikey Johnston stepped up to the plate with two goals in Celtic’s dismantling of the bottom side, Dundee.The 19-year-old winger, deputising for the injured Odsonne Édouard, Celtic’s only recognised centre-forward, opened the scoring with a drive in the 42nd minute of a one-sided match.Johnston, making his second league start this season after scoring off the bench against Motherwell in midweek, doubled his tally in the 50th minute with a header from close range.Filip Benkovic added a third in the 69th minute with a strike from 12 yards to stretch Celtic’s lead at the top of the table to three points over Aberdeen with Rangers, a point behind the Dons, playing at St Johnstone on Sunday.Celtic face Aberdeen on Boxing Day before the Old Firm match against Rangers at Ibrox on December 29, their last before the winter break, and this convincing win will have done confidence no harm at all.As expected Brendan Rodgers tinkered with his line-up as goalkeeper Scott Bain replaced Craig Gordon and midfielder Tom Rogic came in for captain Scott Brown, while Callum McGregor was handed the captain’s armband.Jim McIntyre brought Glen Kamara, Adil Nabi, Ryan Inniss, Benjamin Kallman and Andy Boyle into a side that was soon under pressure.An angled attempt from Anthony Ralston was pushed away by the Dundee keeper, Jack Hamilton, who soon afterwards blocked a Johnston shot from close-range with defender Nathan Ralph heading Scott Sinclair’s drive from the loose ball to safety.Celtic’s dominance grew and in the 12th minute Sinclair’s attempt from the edge of the box sped just past the far post. Five minutes later the Celtic winger ended a driving run by cutting the ball back for Johnston whose volley from eight yards rebounded off the crossbar and the Dundee defence escaped yet again soon afterwards when James Forrest headed a Sinclair cross over the bar.There was no breathing space for the visitors. Hamilton was in the right place to gather Rogic’s shot and Johnston had two more efforts, one saved, one missing by inches but three minutes before the break he took a pass from McGregor, turned inside the box and drilled a low shot past Hamilton into the far corner.Bain had to save a Jesse Curran drive just before the interval that offered Dundee the chance to regroup only to unravel again five minutes after the break when Johnston’s header from Sinclair’s cross went in off the underside of the bar.Dundee had lost 5-0 to Celtic at the end of October and another rout was on the cards.Hamilton parried drives from Forrest and Ralston before Benkovic hammered in from 12 yards after the keeper had parried a shot from the substitute Ryan Christie, on for Forrest.Johnston was given a deserved ovation in the 77th minute when he was replaced by Jonny Hayes and Celtic kept going forward. Ralston beat Hamilton with an angled drive only to see the ball rebound off the post and Ralph cleared another Sinclair effort off the line before the final whistle ended a tough day for Dundee, who ended up three points behind St Mirren.Rodgers was pleased with the performance. “I just said to the players that, in my two-and-a half years here, it was one of my most enjoyable performances. It was so enjoyable, some of our play was so pleasing.”McIntyre recognised his side were inferior to last season’s champions. “Celtic’s movement, at times, was sensational. We struggled to cope with it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2455007e9726f39147c7159c443bf76b6ff911b2/0_115_3055_1833/master/3055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58999d4c7ebaeb9ae83ae589b5700c54","title":"manchester city crystal palace premier league match report","story":"Liverpool have the Christmas present they were looking for after Manchester City surprisingly fell to their second league defeat in three games. Jürgen Klopp and his players can now enter the festive period four points clear of the defending champions at the top of the Premier League. While one point separated the frontrunners City could look forward to rectifying the situation when Liverpool come here in the new year now there might be little they can do if their unbeaten rivals maintain their impressive run of results.City were unrecognisable for large parts of the game and not just because key players were injured or rested. They were unimaginative going forward and sloppy in defence, with Kyle Walker having a game he will want to forget. That is to take nothing away from Crystal Palace, who were organised and effective at both ends and thoroughly deserving of three important points.“When we score three goals away from home I think we can say we deserved it,” the Palace captain Luka Milivojevic said. “Andros Townsend’s goal was amazing.”City’s captain, Fabian Delph, accepted his side had not been at their best. “Palace were stubborn and organised but we started too slowly,” he said. “The ball was not zipping about.”That was certainly true, for the shock of the season took a while to get going, even if a late City goal ensured a dramatic finale. The first half-hour was a test of patience. Palace were content to keep men back, challenging the home side to find a way through, while City’s efforts to make their wealth of possession count were hampered by their being without the spark of ingenuity that David Silva or Kevin De Bruyne would normally supply.It was one of those tepid encounters that needed a goal, though after City finally supplied one after 27 minutes the script took a wholly unexpected twist. Not only did Palace hit back almost straight away, within nine minutes of going behind they were in the lead after Andros Townsend beat Ederson with a delightful left-foot volley from 20 yards out.First things first though. City would not have seen any of that coming when Ilkay Gündoğan strode through a static defence to reach Delph’s cross and beat Vicente Guaita with a firm header. The midfielder ended up unopposed on the six-yard line but had remained onside – the Palace defenders simply failed to pick up his run.The visitors’ only serious threat by that stage had come after six minutes, when John Stones took on a little too much in attempting to justify his selection in midfield and almost presented Wilfried Zaha with an opportunity after being caught in possession in his own half.City could have done with Stones to help out in defence when Palace equalised six minutes after Gündoğan’s goal. Zaha got the better of Aymeric Laporte on the right, then as the ball was transferred across the edge of the area Jeffrey Schlupp found room to get round Walker and make space for a shot past Ederson.Before City had a chance to reply they were suddenly behind and again there were questions to be asked of the defence. A free-kick into the area was not properly cleared and after two weak headers in succession from Gündoğan and Bernardo Silva the ball reached Townsend just outside the area. The winger returned it with a spectacular volley into Ederson’s top-left corner.“It sat up perfectly,” the scorer said. “I knew I couldn’t take a touch as City would have been on me and away on the counter.”Pep Guardiola’s response was to send on Sergio Agüero early in the second half, not for the ineffective Gabriel Jesus as might have been expected, but for Nicolás Otamendi. That meant Stones was back in his usual position just in time to see Palace extend their lead.Aaron Wan-Bissaka took on the defence down the right and from his cutback Townsend was unlucky to see his header strike a post. Walker was overzealous in trying to clear the rebound, jumping in to a tackle and catching Max Meyer in the area, allowing the reliable Milivojevic to score emphatically from the spot.That prompted De Bruyne’s arrival on a rescue mission for the final half-hour, with Riyad Mahrez following him on to the pitch a few minutes later.Until the closing stages the nearest City came to a fightback was a Leroy Sané free-kick that struck an upright, though when De Bruyne beat Guaita five minutes from time with a dipping shot that looked suspiciously like a cross, the crowd woke up to encourage their side to retrieve at least a point.The best chance of City’s final push came in stoppage-time when what was definitely a De Bruyne cross found Jesus on the six-yard line, only for the Brazilian to head over.One heroic block by James Tomkins to deny Gündoğan later, Palace had their victory and a sorry week for Manchester managers was complete."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9ffd50f40cc053ad808787468b99b80b79cfb02/0_23_2907_1744/master/2907.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55753fda28b6b4659b3db97a38572c14","title":"cardiff city v manchester united premier league live","story":"It’s the second half! United get it underway, the first having gone just about as well as Ole could have hoped. As for the half-time break itself, Matt Emerson would like to suggest how Jose spent it: “Alone. In the dark. In his vest and pants. Eating Doritos.” It’s a picture and no mistake. One of Gmail’s suggested auto-replies to Matt’s missive was “So cute!” The algorithms still need a bit of tweaking, I’d argue.45 min: Pogba has a dig from 25 yards. He shanks it 25 yards wide. There will be three minutes added to this first half.43 min: A free kick for Cardiff, in the middle of the United half. Camarasa hoicks it out left. Arter hooks it back in, and the ball lands on the top of the crossbar and bounces out for a goal kick. United have been quite magnificent in this half, but Cardiff have played their part in an entertaining game.What a goal this is! Old-school United are back! Martial probes down the inside right. He flips a pass left for Pogba, who slips one to Martial’s right for Lingard. Finally Lingard pings it back to Martial, who saunters free into the area and slots the calmest of finishes into the bottom left! First-time brilliance!39 min: Shaw threatens to break clear into the Cardiff box, but Manga does well to shut the door. United come straight back at the hosts, though, Lingard sashaying in from the left and whistling a low shot straight down Etheridge’s throat.Camarasa to take. And he launches a wonderful spot kick into the top left, de Gea with no chance whatsoever! You’ll not see a better penalty than that all year. And the stadium erupts, the game suddenly back on!37 min: Another chance for Gunnarsson to fling a throw into the area from the right. Rashford looks to run the dropping ball out of the box. He leans into it with his shoulder, and Michael Oliver points to the spot!35 min: It’s all United. Pogba drives down the left and flicks the ball off Gunnarsson for another corner. Young hits it long for Herrera, the pair trying to replicate the famous Beckham-Scholes one-two against Bradford back in the day. Nope. As Cardiff clear, Shaw lunges in late on Murphy and is properly booked.33 min: Young threatens down the right. Bamba is forced to clear for a corner. Cardiff are all over the shop as they try to defend it, Martial nearly prodding home at the far post, Morrison hooking away just in time.31 min: Cardiff win a corner on the left, Murphy earning it off Herrera. It proves a non-event, though Murphy comes straight back at United down the left and reaches the byline. Unfortunately for the hosts, Murphy flashes an over-excitable cross high over de Gea and away from danger.Well this is spectacular! But so simple. Pogba cuts in from the left and curls a pass to Herrera in the middle of the Cardiff half. From 30 yards, he aims for the top right ... and in it flies, Etheridge with no chance again! There’s a big deflection on Herrera’s shot, off the back of Cunningham. Not that Solskjaer cares, as he celebrates in the dugout with a look of sheer delight playing across his face!27 min: Rashford runs into the back of Cunningham. It’s a common or garden free kick, but the Cardiff fans explode in anger anyway. Hey, it’s panto season. There’s a fine atmosphere in the stadium, both sets of fans giving it plenty.25 min: From that, Young fizzes a ball through the six-yard box. Jones can’t quite get on the end of it. United’s bright start continues apace.24 min: Rashford is barged to the turf by Gunnarsson. Young takes the free kick, out on the left touchline. He looks for Pogba at the far post Bamba does very well to eyebrow the ball out for a corner. 23 min: Phil Jones goes marauding down the left wing. It’s a new era OK.21 min: Bamba strips the ball from Lingard in the centre circle. He romps upfield and has Murphy in acres on the left. There’s no United defender covering that half of the field at all! Just like the second half at Anfield last weekend. But Bamba doesn’t see the pass and is eventually dispossessed. Martial goes up the other end, crossing from the left. Rashford’s snapshot is blocked well by Cunningham.20 min: United are snapping into quite a lot of tackles, closing down a fair bit of space. It’s a conspicuous change in approach.18 min: Lindelof turns back down the United right and very nearly plays himself into a bit of trouble, with Murphy and Arter hovering around. He eventually does very well to slip a pass back to de Gea, who blooters clear.16 min: Paterson is back on his feet and by the looks of it he’s good to continue. Shaw’s back into the action as well it’s all good to see. The game restarts, and Martial skins Manga down the left again. He cuts back in the hope of finding Rashford, but Camarasa has read the danger well.14 min: Murphy makes good down the left and his low cross is hacked out by Jones. Centre stage again for Gunnarsson, who flings in one of those long throws. In the heat of an aerial battle, Shaw and Paterson nut each other in the full-on style. Paterson has come off the worst, and is lying on the turf looking very groggy indeed, a large ice pack pressed to his forehead. A long break in play.12 min: Martial’s dribble down the left earns a corner off Manga. Young’s delivery is smacked clear by the head of Bamba. “I feel that, on the basis of these ten minutes, United have found their permanent manager and can bring their search to a close immediately,” writes Peter Raleigh. “What club do I support? I don’t see how that’s relevant.”10 min: “I could never figure why Mourinho didn’t give MartialRashfordLingard a run as a front trident similar to Liverpool’s,” writes Hubert O’Hearn. “So I give Solskjaer top marks already for satisfying my curiosity. My suspicion is that the experiment will work out very, very well.” The early signs are certainly good. Though not everything will be fixed immediately, of course. Jones makes a half-arsed clearing header, and is thankful that Hoilett’s attempt to latch onto the loose ball and move towards the area is similarly clumsy.8 min: Lingard clumsily barges Gunnarsson to the ground, 25 yards out. Murphy looks to plant the free kick into the top right, but it’s always high and wide. A small foothold in the game for Cardiff, though, after United’s blistering start.6 min: Shaw robs a dithering Hoilett near the centre circle. Rashford goes tearing towards the Cardiff box. The move eventually breaks down, but United are on the front foot alright. They’re swarming around their opponents in the new-fangled pressing style. A penny for Jose’s thoughts right now.4 min: A suggestion that the free kick might have taken a nick off Paterson en route to the goal. But still, what a hit. In the stands, Ed Woodward smiles broadly, in full cat-cream mode.Gunnarsson drags down Pogba as the United midfielder looks to spin into space, 30 yards from goal. A free kick in a dangerous position. Pogba steps over it, allowing Rashford to send a stunning, swerving effort around the wall and into the bottom right, Etheridge rooted to the spot! What a start to the Solskjaer era!2 min: United ping it around the middle of the park awhile. There are already signs that they’ll have a more proactive attitude under the new regime, with Shaw and Young pushing up high on the wings.Cardiff get the party started! The ball’s immediately launched long. Some head tennis, and then a chance for Gunnarsson to Delap a throw into the United box from the right. The ball’s flung into the mixer, and Jones passes the early aerial test.The teams are out! Cardiff City are in their famous blue shirts, while Manchester United wear their storied red. A wonderful atmosphere in the stadium, a Christmas party in blue. We’ll be off in a minute!A very cheery Neil Warnock speaks, and delivers a masterclass in expectation management. “We’re looking forward to this. We worked our socks off last year, against all the odds, to get here, so we’ll enjoy it. We’ll give it our best shot, that’s all the lads can do. They’ve been super. I know there will be players out to prove things on their side we’ve been a bit unlucky in that respect following on from Southampton and Leicester, with the circumstances around those games, but we just have to get on with it. The crowd will be important, and we can’t concede early. We’ve got to be on our game. We think there are weaknesses and we’ve got to do our best to find them. It’s fair to say that if you look at the teamsheets, we’re miles apart, but that’s football, and you never know what’s around the corner.”Pre-match reading. Here’s our man Ed Aarons on some of the most memorable caretaker reigns of recent times. Contains quite a lot of Chelsea and Newcastle United, as you’d expect.Wayne Rooney is BT Sport’s special guest this evening. He’s asked whether getting shot of Jose Mourinho was the right idea. He says yes. “To be a successful football club, you need everything to be right, to be happy. That rubs off on the players. The relationships between some of the staff and the players wasn’t great. But the players are smiling again. It’s a good move for the club, and it’ll be fascinating to see how Ole sets the team up and how they play today.” He talks intelligently, does Rooney he’ll make a good pundit one day if he fancies it.Neil Warnock makes one change to the Cardiff City starting XI named in the 3-2 defeat at Watford last Saturday. Greg Cunningham replaces Joe Bennett.The first Manchester United team picked by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has four changes to the one named for the 3-1 loss at Anfield last Sunday. Eric Bailly, Diogo Dalot, Matteo Darmian and Romelu Lukaku are replaced by Phil Jones, Luke Shaw, Anthony Martial and ... cue drum roll and fanfare ... Paul Pogba.On the sixth of October 1945, Manchester United drew 0-0 at home to Everton in the Wartime League North. On the eighth of November 1986, they lost 2-0 at Oxford United in the old First Division. The managerial debuts of Matt Busby and Alex Ferguson there. From small acorns to mighty oaks.Will Manchester United look back similarly on the 22nd of December 2018 in years to come? Let’s wait and see, huh, but safe to say the result of today’s visit to Cardiff City shouldn’t be treated as much of a signifier in the grand scheme of things. You only have to consider the 2-0 win over Wigan Athletic in the 2013 Community Shield, or the 2-1 victory over Leicester City in the 2017 version, to realise that. The triumphant managerial debuts of David Moyes and Jose Mourinho, like you needed to be told.So yes, in that sense, today should mean nothing to United and their new interim manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Not a thing. But of course the reality is different. They’ll be desperate to get back on the horse after last weekend’s capitulation at Liverpool. There’s still the faint hope of finishing in the top four a win today would signal they haven’t given up the chase quite yet. And most importantly of all, it’s a chance to make an early statement of intent under Solskjaer, as they reroute and take their first tentative steps back down the Manchester United Way.There’s only one small problem. Their hosts this evening, Cardiff City, have won their last three Premier League matches at home, four of the last five on their own patch. It’s a splendid run that’s taken Neil Warnock’s team out of the relegation places. They’ll be hoping to catch United on another off day, still feeling giddy after a tumultuous week, and condemn them to a third away defeat on the bounce. With Cardiff resurgent at home, United determined to make an instant mark under their new boss, and the small matter of Solskjaer having once managed the Bluebirds himself, this is poised perfectly. It’s a new dawn. It’s a new day. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ae096fa0b56b9a8c7cf30aa96a08c23381e2337/0_68_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fff75dc2ef0ba9f4f9ed2d3cd75fce5d","title":"manchester city v crystal palace chelsea v leicester and more live","story":"Man City trail Liverpool by four points after being stunned by Palace, while Leicester’s 1-0 win at Chelsea may have kept Claude Puel in a jobWhat an afternoon in the Premier League. We wondered how Manchester City would react after Liverpool applied a little pressure last night. And the answer is not too well. having said that, Palace played brilliantly and Andros Townsend’s stunning strike was not just a gift for Liverpool fans, it was a joy to behold whoever you support. And a tip of the hat to Leicester too, who battled their way to a wonderful 1-0 win at Chelsea. I’ll leave you now. You can head over to follow Cardiff v Manchester United with Scott Murray, where Marcus Rashford has already given Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side a 1-0 lead. Merry Christmas!The Canaries are top of the Championship tree again.I’ll tell you who isn’t full of festive cheer today … Sean Dyche! He’s accused Arsenal of “absolute cheating”, which sounds like the title of a compilation DVD of es. Brendan Rodgers’ side are top and three points clear of Aberdeen after a comfortable home win. It’s the one you’ve been waiting for.Roy Hodgson and Pep Guardiola have been speaking to Sky after the match.We made it a decent start to the game. We scored a goal and the first two times they cross our halfway line they score two goals. Afterwards it is diffcult. They counter-attacked with quality. Congratulations to Crystal Palace. We played good, we opened the game up and they didn’t do anything. The second goal was an incredible one. The response from my team was perfect. We cannot say they didn’t try. It’s better to win but there are a lot of games to play. On the Liverpool game: “It’s imperative we think about the next games. We have Leicester and Southampton away before Liverpool.”Here’s Dominic Fifield’s report from Stamford Bridge on the day’s other shock result. Here’s occasional  scribe Tim de Lisle: “Jürgen Klopp said last night that 105 points could be needed to win the Premier League. That was assuming City would drop only three points in the remainder of the season, which they have now done.”Here’s Paul MacInnes’s report from the Vitality Stadium.Here’s Crystal Palace’s Luka Milivojevic, who scored from the spot again today, on his side’s stunning 3-2 win over Manchester City at the Etihad: We worked this way on counter-attacks. We wanted to convert them to score. The second goal from Andros was one of the best goals I’ve seen in my career. We had a penalty in the second half that was massive. As a two-goal cushion gives more pressure. A great day.”An email from Sabu Cherian: “Eight of the clubs which went into the Christmas at the top over the last nine seasons have gone on to win the Premier League. The exception, being Liverpool, when they lost the title in 2013-14 to Manchester City by two points. In that season, Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea parked the bus to overcome Liverpool 2-0 before Crystal Palace held the Reds to an enthralling 3-3 draw at Selhurst Park. Have the tables turned? It’s the same Palace, which has today defeated City just before Christmas to help Liverpool enjoy a game’s cushion in the title race. Will Riyad Mahrez’s missed penalty against Liverpool prove to be a costly one? Or, will City’s bench strength prevail? All in all, we have an enticing second half of the title race before us.” We certainly do Sabu.It’s another three points for Ralph Hasenhüttl.All eyes are on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in Cardiff as Manchester United’s new caretaker manager prepares to face his former club in the first match since José Mourinho’s sacking. Paul Pogba starts for United as do Anthony Martial, Luke Shaw and Phil Jones. You can follow it with your friend and mine, Scott Murray, here: Here’s Paul Doyle’s report from London Stadium. Here’s Paul Wilson’s match report from a dramatic afternoon at the Etihad in which Townsend’s stunning strike was incredible, but perhaps not as incredible as the result itself. And here’s what that result – and Leicester’s win at Chelsea – has done to the Premier League table. Gobble that up Liverpool fans.Away from the drama in the Premier League, Norwich went top of the Championship thanks to a late strike from Teemu Pukki, who was chatting to teh  just the other day. Javier Gracia’s side are back in form again. They do have a tendency to do things in streaks. West Ham had won four on the bounce going into this so it’s some result for Watford. A much-needed win for Eddie Howe’s side with Brooks scoring both goals in a bravura display. “Man City have made defeats the new draws. Pep is such an innovator,” honks Niall Mullen. The Hasenhüttl bounce continues apace. And what a lovely moment for 18-year-old Michael Obafemi, who got Saints’ third. Roy’s only gone and done it. How do you like him now Liverpool fans? A first clean sheet for Fulham in a game in which nothing happened.What a result for Puel and Leicester. A gritty performance that will likely keep him in his job. City have missed an absolute sitter … Jesus heading over at the far post under little pressure. And at Christmas too! Chelsea are throwing the kitchen sink at Leicester. And City are doing likewise against Palace. But both sides are holding strong. What a pair of results these could be. City are piling forwards at the Etihad. “So according to my infallible schoolyard logic … Roy\u0026gtPep?” writes Peter Hughes. Well, if they hold on. And if you believe in schoolyard logic. Deulofeu seals three points for the Hornets. What an impressive away win. Well, well, well. City are back in the game. De Bruyne crosses to the far post and Guaita loses the flight of it and it drops in at the far post. Imagine Ronaldinho and Seaman. A bit like that. Nervy times now. Can Roy hold on and find favour with Liverpool fans at long last? In Serie A, Milan have been beaten 1-0 at home by Fiorentina. Milan haven’t won in four games and are clinging on to a Europa League spot. Fiorentina may well take it off them. They’re just two points behind. Newcastle have brought on Kenedy as they look for a bit of guile against Ranieri’s Fulham, who have parked the bus as they search for a first clean sheet.Sané has sent a free-kick whistling over the Crystal Palace wall but it clips a post and goes wide. Manchester City are going to remain four points behind Liverpool as it stands. When Klopp’s side visit the Etihad on 3 January they could even have a cushion to fall back on should they lose. And if they win … well.He’s done it again, popping up with a header to secure the three points for Eddie Howe, whose side needed a win to get back on track. The crowd at Stamford Bridge are growing restless. Leicester are closing down diligently and giving Chelsea very little space to play between the lines. Puel may keep his job for Christmas. Well, that’s not going to make an equaliser any more likely. It was a second yellow card. Bournemouth lead 1-0. What a moment for the 18-year-old Republic of Ireland international, who is just on to replace Ings. Redmond robbed Schindler, who dawdled on the ball in his own half, before squaring for the teenager to get off the mark in the Premier League. And what an important three points against relegation rivals these could be for Southampton.Javier Hernandez has just missed a gilt-edged chance to equalise for West Ham against Watford, who are playing themselves back into form after a sticky patch through Novemeber and the beginning of December. Newcastle are still dominating up at St James’s Park. But Fulham are defending stoically. Yes, you did read that right. Might they get their first clean sheet of the season? Ranieri’s tinkering with his five-man defence seems to be working. De Bruyne replaces Delph for City and Mahrez is also getting stripped off. Pep has called for the kitchen sink! Saido Berahino has only gone and done a goal! He doesn’t do many these days, so cherish it Stoke fans. It’s Stoke 1-0 Millwall. Beep! Beep! Beep! This Crystal Palace team is reversing. And Man City can’t find a way through the massed ranks that Roy Hodgson has set up deep inside the Palace half. It looks like De Bruyne is going to come on. They need some ingenuity – and the Belgian has it in spades. Sunderland are showing some fight against Portsmouth. Luke O’Nien has got one back for the 10 men who score in every game. It’s 2-1 to Pompey. Saints keeper McCarthy will not want to watch this back. Billing pulls one back with a shot right down McCarthy’s throat that he should keep out, but doesn’t. Dwight Gayle has scored a hat-trick for West Brom, who are rampant at Rotherham. They lead 4-0 now. They will close to within three point of leaders Leeds and second-placed Norwich if the Canaries fail to beat Blackburn. In League One, Pompey are piling the pain on 10-man Sunderland. Ronan Curtis has made it 2-0 to the league leaders, who will stay a point ahead of second-placed Luton, who are leading Burton 1-0, and five clear of their third-placed opponents.My word! This is incredible. Palace win a penalty after a foul following a Townsend header that hit the post. Milivojević rarely misses from the spot. He slots … and 30 miles away the red half of Liverpool rejoices. City aren’t responding well to pressure at all. How important this could be for Puel’s future at Leicester. Maddison picks out Vardy, who slots home. What a turn up. Maybe he likes Puels’s style after all. One player who will have Boxing Day off is Sunderland’s Glenn Loovens, who has been sent off for the seventh time in his career in England. It’s a penalty to Pompey … and Evans converts, sending the capacity crowd at Fratton Park into raptures. It’s Portsmouth 1-0 Sunderland. Looks good for Celtic and Aberdeen, who will pull away from Rangers who play tomorrow.I’m off to make a half-time cuppa. While I’m away why not get worked up by perusing our 2018 list of the top 100 footballers in the world and then snort with derision as you wonder why Footballer X is not higher than Footballer Z. And sign up for The Fiver if you like football and forced humour. Here you go:Mike Mackenzie writes: “Townsend’s cannon shot goal was like Santa Claus coming to town ... except for City fans. I’m sure all Liverpool fans are grateful!” I expect they are, yes (cough!). Though there are still many, many minutes left. It will be interesting to see how City respond to feeling under pressure in the league, though, as they haven’t felt domestic pressure for about 17 months. I’m still processing that Townsend volley. It was incredible. He was kind of side on as he hit it which meant it wasn’t a dipper and had a lovely aesthetic feel to it, even though it was hit so hard. It could stand up against some of these sumptuous strikes. The on-loan Liverpool striker gives the Saints a healthy first-half lead from the spot. Hasenhüttl is having some impact. In the Championship, bottom-of-the-table Ipswich have taken the lead over promotion-chasing Sheffield United. That would be a precious win if they can see it through. Ellis Harrison scored the goal.Oh My! What an absolute pearler! This is a goal-of-the season contender for sure. Pep Guardiola looks stunned. City head clear and the ball falls out of the air about 30 yards from goal. Townsend should control it and look to prompt another attack. But instead he absolutely leathers a first-time volley with his left foot that hits the back of the net like a missile. Incredible! The goal … and the scoreline!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa3e5c6d48399fe9029efadef95affa3b8ec3fa6/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf09ad1619bef5cf6aadc2738c51286c","title":"real madrid v al ain club world cup final live","story":"Thanks for joining me this afternoonevening. It wasn’t a classic game but at least there were a few goals.Check back in shortly when the report will be with you.A lovely finish from Llorente, too, as he showed why he is getting his chance under Solari. He had great energy throughout and get Real Madrid moving up the pitch.Modric was given all the time in the world to do what he wanted to from start to finish and thoroughly deserved his goal. Benzema will be looking to find his shooting boots once again, as he missed a number of great opportunities. The result was never really in doubt. Al Ain did their best but the gulf in quality was too much. Real Madrid really should have scored more but at least Al Ain can tell their families about scoring against the Spanish giants. It’s a third straight Club World Cup for Real Madrid, which is an achievement, in a way.This is better from Vinicius as he gets the other side of the defence and then pulls the ball back, forcing Nader to do something, that thing being kicking the ball into his own net. 90 mins: Vinicius has certainly watched a lot of Neymar as he tries to dribble past a couple of Al Ain players in the box but instead of defeating them he just throws himself to the ground and appeals for a penalty. He really should have been booked. Grow up, mate. 88 mins:  Another free-kick is chucked into the box but on this occasion Courtois comes to claim it, which is exciting. This is the best game the world has ever seen!GAME ON!! A free-kick into the box is flicked over Courtois and into the top corner by Shiotani. What a lovely memory for him. 85 mins: Vinicius is on for Real Madrid, so we can all enjoy seeing if he is the future of football. Fellow Brazilian Casemiro has gone down injured and looks in plenty of pain. No point in risking him considering this game is done.83 mins: Fair play to Al Ain for getting this far and earning the opportunity to face Real Madrid but the difference in standards is there for all to see. How can they make this tournament more interesting?81 mins: Just in case there was any doubt, there is no way Al Ain are getting back into this, so instead let’s just watch the procession. Casemiro is now on, too, just ensure Real Madrid don’t concede three in the next nine minutes. I think it might work Mr Solari.Ramos is bored so instigates a counter-attack up the pitch and keeps running into the opposition area but Vazquez’s cross doesn’t make it as far as the centre-back, instead being slid out for a corner. The resulting set-piece from Modric very conveniently lands on his unmarked head right yards from goal and he obligingly puts it into the top corner. 77 mins: Carvajal chips a pass over the top for Bale but he takes too long, allowing Ahmed to get back and intercept him when through on goal. The Welshman then latches onto the loose ball but Eisa bests him once again. 75 mins: Courtois is forced into his first save of the match after a very long ball over the top from his opposite number makes its way to Caio, who gets the better of Ramos but his shot is straight at the Belgian and the follow-up is volleyed over. Yahia is now on for Al Ain, which also won’t make any difference. 73 mins: The pace of this game is similar to walking football now. More of this please. 71 mins: More Marcelo news: he chases the ball into the corner, keeps it in play but he ends up in a heap off the pitch and stays down holding his ankle, while Al Ain clear. He is up again and running round. Kroos is replaced by Ceballos, which is nice. 69 mins: Al Ain look pretty tired and Real Madrid are just knocking it around under absolute no pressure, I suspect Modric will do a handstand in the middle of the pitch sooner or later.67 mins: Another to add to the list proving Marcelo does not give a toss about this game he sees the goalkeeper off his line so decides to smash a shot from 50 yards which goes nowhere near the net. Cheers, mate.Mohamed Abdulrahman is replaced by Amer Abdulrahman, which will also make no difference to the result. 65 mins: Kroos slips the ball down the channel for Bale to latch onto but the Welshman is closed down by Eisa who smothers his shot. Al Ahbabi is on for Al Ain, which one assumes will change absolutely nothing here. 63 mins: Al Ain’s Ahmed absolutely bloody loves ing into a challenge from 10 yards away. The latest person to make a fool of him is Benzema who sees the defender come and dinks it over his outstretched leg before crossing for Bale who slices his shot wide. 61 mins: Al Ain are yet to have a shot on target, so it seems unlikely that they will be able to score twice. Al Ain clear a corner to the edge of the area where Llorente is waiting and he fires a low drive straight into the bottom corner before the goalkeeper has a chance to move. Game over. 57 mins: Llorente races onto a pass over the top but can’t get the ball under control and goes down under pressure but the referee sees nothing in it. 55 mins: The American referee has a word after some pushing and shoving in the box before Al Ain take a woeful corner along the ground which is smashed clear. It comes straight back but a shot from Yaslem goes out for a throw-in. 53 mins: Bale gets away from the defence down the left and sends a cross right to an onrushing Benzema but he volleys the ball straight into the ground and it bounces a few inches wide. He really should have done better there. 51 mins: Pinball in the box after Modric rides a challenge (he probably should have just gone down for a penalty), then his cross is headed up in the air, allowing Bale to perform a spectacular overhead kick but it goes just over the bar. Real Madrid have upped the tempo after the break as they look to add a crucial second.49 mins: Bale drives into the box but is held up well by Ahmad, forcing the Welshman to dribble the ball straight out of play, much to his chagrin. 47 mins: Marcelo loses the ball while trying to nutmeg his opponent. The Brazilian isn’t really taking today seriously. Here we go again!!The teams are wandering back out onto the pitch, while Isco heads back to the bench looking miserable as sin. Real Madrid will be looking to finish this off quite quickly and avoid any added exertion in what has been a pretty simple match so far. It has been all Real Madrid in Abu Dhabi, which is no surprise. The only real shocking thing is that it is not more than 1-0. It was a great strike from Modric but they really should have added to it. Needless to say, Al Ain aren’t very good.45 mins: Ramos goes into the book for a foul on Caio. He completely misses the ball and instead smashing into the Brazilian to send him off the pitch. No wonder no one likes Ramos.44 mins: Some lovely football in the box results with Marcelo receiving the ball on the edge of the box but he is dispossessed when he attempts to do a 360. 42 mins:  Marcelo is adding to his list of errors here: the latest being taking a throw-in and then standing in an offside position as it is returned to him. Wake up Marcelo. Fayez goes down in pain after Bale sends a Benzema cross well over the bar but the Al Ain man’s attempt to block it seems to cause him some sort of injury. 40 mins: Eisa with some lovely acrobatics to get off his feet and tip a Bale header over the bar from a corner. Everyone thought it was going in but the goalkeeper had different ideas. The subsequent corner is chipped towards Modric on the edge of the box from where he volleys it (think Scholes v Bradford) towards the bottom corner but the goalkeeper was equal to it. 38 mins: So ... Al Ain have a free-kick out on the left but rather than cross it into the box, it is sent across the pitch and out for a throw-in. Rarely have I seen such a useless set-piece, it was worse than Joey Barton’s corners for Manchester City.36 mins: It really should be 2-0 after Vazquez pulls the ball back straight to the feet of Benzema who is eight yards out and unmarked but contrives to smash the ball well over the bar mainly due to the fact he was leaning so far back it might as well be lying down.34 mins: Luke asks: “Hi Will. What a fantastic match up we have here today! Could you share with us some of your fondest memories of Al Ain Football Club over the years? Just a few paragraphs will do.”My personal highlight was when Manchester City played them in a midseason friendly, winning 3-0. Richard Wright was part of the squad who travelled and someone from the club sent me his shirt afterwards. Great days.32 mins: There is a lot of space down the left, which Marcelo and Bale try to make the most of but the Welshman’s cross from the byline hits the first man and ricochets off a Real Madrid player out for a goal-kick.30 mins: A Worse Pass of the Year contender from Marcelo, who sends a 10-yard pass to absolutely no one down the flank. I think that was the opposite of showboating, whatever that is. 28 mins: Vazquez essentially walks through the Al Ain defence but his pass to Kroos sends the German wider than he wants, resulting in a poor cross straight to the goalkeeper.

My Nokia 3210, unveiled the previous year, was state of the art. Competitively priced, lightweight (we thought) … there were even different coloured covers!Fast-forward 18 years and my daughter Alice – 12, new to phone ownership and not easily impressed – is examining this piece of communication history. In her first year of secondary school, with her interests and independence growing fast, Alice uses a smartphone to communicate with friends, organise activities, listen to music and take photos, as well as to contact and be contacted by us.In recent years, parents of communication-hungry tweens faced a predicament: offer their child a smartphone with unfettered access to the world wide web (and everything that comes with it) or pick up an older phone, with limitations imposed by more primitive technology. Now, thankfully, there’s a third way.Alice will be comparing the Nokia with the Verve IMO S2 with monqi – a new phone exclusive to Tesco Mobile, and designed specifically for children and young teenagers easing into mobile technology. How will it and the classic Nokia shape up in her fickle fingers?First up, the Nokia 3210.“It’s really heavy,” she exclaims. “The screen is tiny. It looks old.” She is examining the handset with the sort of sceptical curiosity she might extend towards a fax machine, or acarrier pigeon.“I guess you could call people and text them,” shesays. “Very slowly,” she adds, noticing the three-letters-per-key setup. No emojis. That’s not good. Her face briefly brightens as she spots the hash key. “Wait. What did you actually use that for back then?”The lack of a camera bothers her even more than the no internet access, presumably because the latter is available via our home computer. Not being able to listen to music is another shortcoming.With her reaction so far fairly scathing, it is time to reveal the phone’s killer feature: Snake! This, initially at least, is a hit. “That’s quite good!” she decides, setting about the game. Her initial enthusiasm proves short-lived. “Actually, it’s pretty boring.”Asked when the phone might have been designed, Alice hazards a guess at 1990. At almost triple her lifetime ago, that is ancient history for her.Does the 3210 have “old skool” appeal perhaps? “No,” she says firmly. “Retro is good in clothes, but not in phones.”Case closed. On to the IMO S2 with monqiThis, it would seem, is more like it. “It looks nice. It feels smooth to hold and use and it has a good-size screen – not too big or too small,” says Alice, back in her comfort zone.First of all she checks out the photo options, pulling a series of silly selfie faces. There are two cameras, I tell her, peering at the manual. “Of course there are, front and back,” she says, raising an eyebrow at my ignorance.“It’s really easy to work out,” she says, connecting to the wifi and starting to browse the website of a clothing brand she covets. As well as online window shopping, Alice uses her phone to watch clips from favourite films and musicals, to research and help with homework (foreign language dictionaries for example), and to stream music and contact friends via – parent approved – social media.She makes the odd phone call too, mainly to me, often to ask if she can go to a friend’s, and frequently followed by a call to request a lift home.Taking photos is a favourite pastime, and Alice likes the editing features on the IMO S2. She quickly starts to play around with tints and effects, writing captions and adding characters to her pictures.Intrinsic to the IMO S2 is the monqi operating system, which enables parents – having installed the parent app on their own phones – to monitor and shape how the child’s phone is used.Functions include: setting time limits on usage (remote shut down at homework or dinner time, for instance), blocking unsuitable internet content (monqi’s bespoke browser has built-in filters), monitoring internet and phone usage in real time, and checking on whereabouts. There is also a family chat option – a controlled alternative to third-party messenger apps.“Parental controls are a good idea, especially for younger children when you definitely want to know they are only seeing appropriate things,” says Alice, as she scrolls through the monqi functions.She admits that time limits make sense too. “Especially at first it’s good to make sure it isn’t being used all the time. I do lots of other activities, which keep me busy, but it can sometimes be tempting to have my phone on too long, especially if lots of group conversations are going on.”Having a smartphone has been helpful for settling into secondary school, she says – facilitating new friendships and enabling her to keep in touch with old classmates too.“A smartphone makes it easy to swap numbers and send a message or join a chat with your school friends,” says Alice. “With an old-style phone you would have to call someone direct, and that would feel more daunting,” she adds.The monqi system ensures this is all done safely new contacts are approved through the parent app, so mums and dads get a chance to check they are legitimate and appropriate.The IMO S2 meets with Alice’s approval. “Your parents look after you, and this setup is another way of them doing that. I’d be very happy to have this phone,” she says.Although used to tales of her parents’ seemingly prehistoric analogue childhoods, her foray into early mobile phones has given her a new sense of how technology has changed. “It has made me really appreciate how much we can do now.”Not having today’s smartphone technology would make her life more complicated, she says. “I think we are very lucky today. Maybe those early phones were ok for someone older,” she says in a placatory tone, looking straight at me.I think we have a winner.Visit Tesco Mobile to find out more about the IMO S2 with monqi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0896450882ebe852943fe6091e587c189199152/0_72_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47fc95829c1d7604f2df0a51ea6be8b2","title":"i feel more independent one 11 year old on her first year with a phone","story":"Amelia, aged 11, from Bristol shares her experiences of phone ownership – from the ‘contract’ she signed with her parents to getting lost on the way to schoolI finally got a phone last September, just as I started secondary school. I was one of the last people in my class to get one and it felt like I’d been waiting forever. Most of the others had one in year 6. My parents said I didn’t need one, as I was only walking down the road to school. But I think it would have made sense.Negotiating a contractWe talked a lot before the phone arrived. Mostly about when and where I could use it. But I was happy I was allowed a smartphone! I know one girl who just has this old-looking one. My parents and I decided we’d come up with a kind of contract between us. This is what we agreed:I was mostly OK with the rules. But not the social media one, as loads of my friends have Instagram! It was an improvement on the first version, though. That one said I was only allowed my phone downstairs!Coping with peer pressureThe phone has changed my life. These changes are mostly good, but I do feel that some bits have not gone quite as well. You feel like you can never make a mistake in a message.One of the better things is I feel more independent. I can plan when to see friends without asking my parents. If I walk 40 minutes to school the phone makes me feel safe. When I first started the walk, I took a wrong turning and ended up lost in the docks. All I could see was boats! Thankfully, I could call my dad. He helped me.But I sometimes feel my parents get cross with me more often now. The other day I was on my phone messaging and my mum started getting annoyed. She told me it was unhealthy to spend so much time looking at a screen, and I should “interact more with the real world”. I got angry and shouted back.Getting used to phone lifeAt first I thought it was a bit weird that my parents could look at my phone whenever. But I don’t really care or notice now. I don’t go online much. I mainly use my phone to chat or play games. I use the computer in the kitchen for the internet.Sometimes my phone distracts me. If I’m in the middle of a conversation and I get a message, I’ll turn to my phone instead. And if I hear a notification, I’ll rush to check my phone.But I’d never be without my phone now.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ebdfd732764928a71b7c35bef8b8818823df55/0_19_1714_1028/master/1714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ab69a94870b46e156bb355d81f43a7","title":"quiz litty shook or goat can you talk tween","story":"Finstagram, spilling tea and looking snatched.

My parents’ drive, energy and work ethic was incredible and they never moaned, even when the business they’d built up from scratch collapsed in the 90s. They lost everything, but they took other jobs, started again and enabled my brother and me to finish our educations.Race meant nothing to me growing up in Bradford. I’m an Indian and grew up among Sikhs, Punjabis, Muslims, Pakistanis, white English and Lebanese. I was the only Asian kid in my school, but it wasn’t an issue. On my 16th birthday I invited my six best friends to a Sikh temple and they all dressed up in Sikh costume and helped chop vegetables.Sitting around doing nothing is horrendous. I’m always up at the crack of dawn, freezing my ass off in a field somewhere, but I love it. My husband is trying to teach me how to lounge. The only pacifier that really works is Netflix.Some people think I’m rude, but I’m just a straight-talking girl from Yorkshire. I’m proud to be from a county with a very strong cultural identity.Shouting across a table in a rowdy pub is what life is all about. I’ve been known to dance on the table, too, but my friends don’t even bat an eyelid. They’ll just look up and go, “OK, Anita’s on the table again.” I need to rein that in actually.Just because you like the countryside doesn’t mean you have to listen to Bach all day long. I grew up in the 90s and went to Leeds University so music and dancing is a huge part of my world. It’s part of my youth culture. Part of my tribe. I love drum and bass and hip-hop and music by white men with guitars.I ran away from therapy. I don’t think you figure out what sort of person you are until life throws shit at you. Everyone keeps telling me, therapy’s the thing to do, but I just felt that the idea of talking about yourself was so indulgent.For a long time I’ve done what a lot of women do and that’s saying what you think people want to hear. Pleasing people. Giving the right answers. The older I get the more exhausting I find it not to be honest. I’ve held my tongue for way too long. I’ve been in a meeting where someone thought it was OK to do an Indian accent and I just laughed it off like everyone else. I wish I’d told them to stick it. That wasn’t too long ago either and there have been so many moments like that. I want to stop doing what I’ve been doing since I was a kid – not rocking the boat. I want to rock the boat.

Then, set back from the road, is Ferrum House: a mottled brutalist cube panelled in raw Corten steel that almost seems to hover above its more restrained timber-clad base.As a town, Bruton is no stranger to innovative architecture. The Hauser \u0026amp Wirth gallery is on its doorstep and a 17th-century chapel in the town centre was converted into the restaurant and hotel At the Chapel in 2009. But when Pennock and Anderson moved here 18 years ago, “it was pre-Hauser and pre-flat whites”, smiles Anderson.The couple came here from Seattle, where Pennock worked in software typography and (US-born) Anderson was a photographer. In fact, one of the reasons they liked the town was because it was a less obvious choice. “It had an air of run-down eccentricity that appealed,” remembers Pennock.This is their third home in the town and they built it on the site of an old garage. “It had been a petrol station and repair shop until the 1960s, but more recently it was just a place where people parked cars,” says Pennock.The garage had been part of a plot belonging to the Georgian house next door – which the couple owned and lived in until their new home was finished. This, of course, was one reason why the planning application had a smooth passage. “On the one side was an old factory building, with no side windows. And on the other was us,” says Pennock.The site was a tricky triangular slice, so the house widens out on the southwest side that faces away from the road, where it opens on to a decked outdoor area. There is a further deck on the first floor and an enclosed one on the top floor, with large openings that frame views of the town and treetops.The design of the house was by Mark Merer. Although it is in a conservation area, the house got the go-ahead “precisely because it didn’t try to copy neighbouring buildings,” explains Pennock. There are no faux cottagey windows, no new-build thatch or Poundbury-style porticos here. “We didn’t offer something that pretended to be ‘in keeping’ with the local vernacular. Instead, it was seen on its own merits, as a convincingly contemporary, well-designed building.”The initial proposal specified that the exterior would be terracotta in colour, but the idea for Corten steel panels came later. “We’d been back to Seattle and saw how Olson Kundig had used the material on a warehouse conversion,” says Anderson. The reddy-orange colour of the bolted-on panels has already mellowed and will continue to darken over time.For the inside spaces, the couple’s wish list was short and to the point: maximise the space and make it as energy efficient as possible. So windows on the southwest side are large to make the most of the light (and heat), while the street side has far smaller openings. An air-source heat pump and structural insulation panels make the house “almost but not quite” up to the Passivhaus energy efficiency rating. Even so, the couple’s utility bills are never more than £100 a month.In keeping with the architecture, surfaces are clean-cut and hardwearing, with polished concrete and sealed cork flooring. Furniture is a mix of high street, vintage finds and modern design classics, such as Eero Saarinen’s womb chair and the shell chair by Arne Jacobsen. Art and sculpture is everywhere, mostly by friends and artists. “We’ve accumulated rather than deliberately collected,” says Pennock.While this is a house that flouts tradition, it has won an award for the best new build in a conservation area from Somerset Building Preservation Trust. “We love it here and can’t imagine living in a period house again,” says Anderson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60f0739487bf289799b3e11daa66f1ba44da2562/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bae16e7bb7c2c221473a505ec06d0bc","title":"how ghost stories have shaped my life","story":"Yuletide ghost stories have shaped my life – as well as my understanding of what happens next…Scrooge was famously haunted by three spectral visitors at Christmas time, but the tradition of telling ghost stories at midwinter goes back much further than Dickens. People have been gathering around the fire to tell stories at Yule, the pagan festival to mark the winter solstice, for centuries. As the year comes to a close, it’s natural to think about loved ones no longer with us – and what better time for ghosts to draw near than deepest, darkest winter?Thinking about the dead and remembering the past go hand in hand, especially at Christmas. Perhaps it’s no surprise the most wonderful time of the year promises scary ghost stories. Reminiscing, it seems, is as compulsory as turkey and tinsel – whether that’s talking about old times with family, re-watching comedy classics, or remembering our childhood days. When I look back at my childhood, few memories are more vivid than the time I saw a ghost. I appreciate that what I’m about to say sounds like fiction, but whether or not it was real or imagined, the experience undeniably shaped my life and the person I am today.Like all good stories, I should start at the beginning… I grew up in a small two-bedroom house in the West Midlands with my mum and my nan. Mum had me when she was 18 and I shared her childhood bedroom, which was filled with her collection of clown dolls, figurines and puppets. I don’t mean one or two – every surface was covered with them. One day, I must have been about seven, I was playing on the floor when I saw a doll move by itself. It didn’t fall off a shelf or slip from its stand, its hand moved as if it was beckoning me. Other things happened, too a door knob rattled when there was no one on the other side.Once, when I was in bed, I saw a white mist, like a whirlwind, hanging above my head. I hid under the covers, terrified, and must have fallen asleep at some point. I asked my nan about it the next day, and she told me that several of my relatives had died in the house. If there was anything there, then they were my family and wouldn’t hurt me. It was like a crack had opened up in my world: if one “impossible” thing could be possible, then why not others? The experience sparked what was to become a life-long fascination with the supernatural – in particular death and what comes after.Growing up, I used to wonder why adults didn’t talk about it more, why scientists and the people in charge weren’t working hard to discover what awaits us: the afterlife or nothingness. Like many adolescents, I kept my thoughts to myself in an effort to appear “normal”, but the obsession never left me.Things began to change when I studied English at A-level. I remember reading Waiting for Godot and having a surreal couple of days when I wandered around school feeling as if I wasn’t really there. Jean-Paul Sartre’s Nausea didn’t help my existential angst – though to be fair, an unhappy home life at the time (a stepfather who didn’t make me feel welcome) probably had more to do with my sense of emotional dislocation.When I realised it wasn’t just Sartre – that other people in history had spent their lifetime contemplating the “big” questions – it was a revelation. I dropped plans to study English Literature at university and took philosophy instead. Although it didn’t answer my questions, it was a comfort to know that others had been troubled by the same concerns: the nature of reality and consciousness, whether God exists, what happens when we die. I wasn’t uniquely mad. I read all kinds of books on ghosts and the paranormal over the years – some taking a scientific view, others philosophical or religious.I was brought up Church of England more by default than choice, and we went to church occasionally, but it was never a big part of my life. My mum also took me along to a spiritualist church a couple of times, where people sat in a village hall and the man at the front passed on messages from a “spirit”. Neither experience really resonated with me.In my late 20s, I sought out people with alternative views – namely occultists and Wiccans. Although I didn’t find any answers, I experienced enough to be convinced that there’s more to our reality than society would conventionally have us believe. That’s not to say I believe every psychic, medium, or TV ghost hunter. The mind and imagination is incredibly powerful and reality is, at least to some extent, affected by perception (a subject which has troubled philosophers from Descartes to Kant).There are all kinds of possible explanations for the supernatural, and part of me would like to put my experiences down to childish imagination – especially when I’m alone in the house at night. But I can’t. It was as real for me as sitting here now typing at my computer is real for me. I haven’t kept it a secret, nor have I tried to convince others of what I saw. How can you believe the impossible unless you’ve experienced it for yourself?Looking back, I can see that there was another reason I was so preoccupied with death as a child. I was acutely aware that my nan was old and wouldn’t always be around. After the doll incident, I refused to sleep in my mother’s bedroom again and shared a double bed with my nan for the rest of my years in that house. I would often lie awake at night, listening to her breathing, afraid to fall asleep in case she should stop.One memory in particular stands out. I was aged around eight or nine, and I was watching her take the curlers from her hair, when a huge wave of worry came over me. I couldn’t imagine her not being in my life one day, and I begged her to come back to me after she died. Tired of my pleading, she promised me that she would try. If there was any way she could, then she would. She died when I was 19 and living away at university. I knew she didn’t have long the last time I saw her, and I told her that I loved her, and I thanked her for bringing me up. Her last words to me were: “Don’t cry, we’ve all got to go sometime.”I suppose that’s why ghost stories are so powerful. Yes, being scared is thrilling and the unknown holds a disturbing kind of fascination. But on a very deep level, we all carry an awareness of our mortality inside us. For purely selfish reasons, don’t we all want to know if we will continue after death in one form or another? Add grief into the mix and ghost stories can have a huge emotional pull. Are our loved ones really still there, watching over us? Are they safe and happy, or lost and alone? Will we ever see them again?It sounds strange, but I grieved for my nan long before she died or was even taken ill. I don’t know whether that made it easier or harder when it happened.The days following her funeral were a kind of blur. I remember briefly dozing off and her face filling my whole mind. It was so vivid – in the way that dreams are when you’re grieving. She said, “you don’t really want me to come back, do you?” I replied no, terrified by the thought, and she smiled and then faded away. I can’t say I’ve seen her ghost, but I’ve often had a sense of being looked after in difficult times: a hand on my shoulder, a sense of comfort. The presence has always felt female.So when I decided to write a novel, I knew it had to be a ghost story. The more I talk about my experiences, the more I realise that I’m not alone. There’s something oddly comforting about sharing ghost stories with people who have seen things too, and I wonder if that’s why our ancestors told scary tales around the fire. Perhaps talking about the darkness is our only hope of getting the measure of it, as if by knowing it, we might lessen its hold on us.Now, at the age of 43 and with a family to care for, I have less time to consider the afterlife, though I like to think that my nan is still with me somehow. It’s only at quiet times, such as the “dead days” between Christmas and new year, that I find myself thinking about the past.Reminiscing can feel a little self indulgent, but don’t we all deserve to take a moment to reflect on the experiences that have made us who we are? Something tells me that Dickens, like Plato, knew that an unexamined life was not worth living. If we want to understand who we are and what we’ve become, we must face the ghosts of the past.Order Twisted Tree by Rachel Burge (published by Hot Key Books, 10 January) from bookshop for £7.03"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b870b80c2a7330b7439bf4a227d1489a24fdcc29/0_0_480_640/master/480.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f667c345b1e5b4f7189cb2f4075b855 720w","title":"david dimbleby rebuffs sneering john humphrys in interview","story":"Former Question Time host rebukes Today presenter for ‘typical sneer’ in interviewDavid Dimbleby took umbrage when the BBC Radio 4 host John Humphrys described him as posh.Dimbleby, who was guest-editing the Today programme on Saturday morning, responded sharply when he was asked about his views on the monarchy.Humphrys said he imagined Dimbleby had been quite close to the Windsors over the years, given the number of royal occasions he had covered and the fact that he was “quite posh”.“Sorry John, there’s a typical sneer in that question,” Dimbleby fired back. “You’re quite posh, I’m about as posh as you are. I come from Wales, you do. I’m not posh, I happen to have been a broadcaster for a long time.”“You had a very distinguished father,” Humphrys retorted, referring to Richard Dimbleby OBE MBE, a leading news commentator for the BBC during the 1950s.“Well, that doesn’t make me posh, I had a distinguished father, that’s a ridiculous question,” Dimbleby said. “No, but the point is about the monarchy. I’m not close to the monarchy, I’ve met the Queen probably less often than you. I’ve met her once, I think. I have no connection at all.”“I don’t know why I made that assumption,” Humphrys said, before going on to question Dimbleby on what he thought about the monarchy.Asked what question he would ask himself in an interview, Dimbleby said: “Ever think of stopping? And I’d say ‘no, I just love asking questions, I’m not sure I like answering them.’”Humphrys thanked Dimbleby for guest-editing the Today programme, and noted that he is “positively not posh”.Many listeners were not so convinced. Online responses to the encounter have focused on the differences between the two BBC veterans’ backgrounds and education. Can a former public school boy who studied at Christ Church Oxford, sent a son to Eton, and is married to the granddaughter of an earl really argue he is not among the nation’s social elite?Even Spectator magazine acknowledged that the guest editor was on shaky ground. “Dimbleby is leading the way when it comes to traditional posh credentials at least,” he said. Listener @lucycthomas called for a rematch:It is true that Dimbleby and Humphrys both have Welsh mothers and began their careers as reporters, but there are few other similarities. To the average audience member, however, they may well both qualify as posh, given they have high salaries and speak with the “received pronunciation” favoured for BBC staffers until recent decades.Humphrys, one of five children, was born to a hairdresser and a self-employed French polisher in Adamsdown, Cardiff. When he passed the 11-plus exam he went on to Cardiff high school, then a grammar. Dimbleby, the elder brother of the Any Questions? radio presenter Jonathan Dimbleby, was born in Surrey to the leading BBC correspondent and presenter Richard Dimbleby. After prep school in Sussex, he went to Charterhouse school in Surrey. He read philosophy, politics and economics at Christ Church, Oxford, where he led the college’s student body, edited the student magazine Isis and was a member of the infamous all-male dining and drinking society, the Bullingdon Club. He graduated with a third-class honours degree.His son Henry Dimbleby, a co-founder of the food chain Leon, was revealed by Jacob Rees-Mogg on a Question Time of 2015 to have been his contemporary at Eton.Dimbleby, who was married to the cookery writer Josceline for 33 years, has been married since 2000 to Belinda Giles, the daughter of the former Sunday Times editor Frank, and granddaughter of the 9th earl of De La Warr. He chaired his last Question Time earlier this month and will be replaced by the BBC newsreader and Antiques Roadshow host Fiona Bruce next month.He still enjoys the political cut and thrust, though. A key element of the Today programme he edited was an interview with the editor of the Evening Standard, George Osborne.After questioning the former chancellor about Brexit, he asked the architect of Tory austerity if he felt homeless “deaths in doorways” were “a direct result of the austerity that you imposed”, which Osborne denied.He then asked Osborne to agree that his career after parliament had capitalised on his previous government position by “taking job after job after job and earning millions of pounds a year”.“You became prominent as chancellor and you now swan around the world making speeches and work for Blackrock, and earn several hundred thousand a year from them. It is as though, somehow, the business of going into politics, which you abandoned when it turned against you, was actually a pathway into what you are doing now, making a buck for yourself.”Osborne replied that he would not be editing a newspaper if he was prioritising his income. Dimbleby also revealed his previous attempts to assume high positions at the national broadcaster during the interview. “I twice tried to become director-general and I once tried to become chairman,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b554dcfc4591e1791802b5fe403696a518fa110a/289_107_4826_2896/master/4826.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cc46c659a7bb4c716fd5abb76d05900","title":"online photo sharing internet safety children more savvy than parents","story":"Study reveals parents are less savvy than their offspring about the perils of posting family photosIt’s become an accepted part of keeping up to date with extended family and friends, but if schoolchildren were in their parents’ shoes, the majority wouldn’t share posts of their sons and daughters online.While some were concerned about being embarrassed or the longevity of content which could remain online indefinitely, others expressed concern about their personal data being compromised. One of the pupils surveyed said: “Although our parents mean well, sometimes the aftermath of a post can be disastrous.”In response to the poll, children’s mental health charity Place2Be and law firm Mischon de Reya have produced three films ahead of the Christmas holidays – the optimum period for parental oversharing.In one video, about safety online, 10-year-old Adavan said: “If you share anything with your family, you know who’s going to see it. But if you share it publicly, there are millions of people who can see your picture.”Joe Hancock, cyber security lead at Mischon de Reya, encouraged parents to share wisely. “Simple steps, such as checking your privacy settings and asking others not to share content of your children on their accounts if they have not updated their privacy settings, is a good start. And, as we found out from the children during filming, having their consent is key,” he said.The study marks a shift away from the usual debate about teaching children to use the internet safely. Sandra Davis, head of the law firm’s family department, said: “Children are the experts on the real and immediate impact of sharenting – the full extent of which we cannot know yet. We must ensure we listen to children and take their views into consideration now in order to avoid any unintended consequences further down the line.”Not all children were wary about the consequences of sharenting, though. Another child who took part in the survey said: “If I have children when I’m older, then I will most likely share pictures of them on Facebook. However, this would only be occasional and primarily just because I would be proud of my child and their accomplishments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16cc12f3e63d1d54a8a3e3fd5b5aa035e6891f96/0_71_1940_1163/master/1940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9d8922eb251f1649c73e1ea38aad568","title":"women tv directors christmas left out in the cold","story":"Survey shows that men remain firmly in control of what we’ll be watching over the festive seasonMale directors will outnumber their female counterparts by six to one on British television this Christmas, despite growing pressure on the entertainment industry to improve equality of gender representation.The festive schedules reveal that only 24 of the 147 film and television directors represented on the main network channels are women, with those that do feature predominantly in charge of panel shows, soaps or children’s cartoon features.The damning figures have been uncovered by a Labour party research team who surveyed the listings for programmes and films being shown on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day.The figures show that Channel 4 does slightly better than other channels, screening the work of seven female directors, including those of The Snowman and The Snowman and the Snowdog. In second place is BBC Two with five women directors in charge of shows such as Only Connect Quiz Special and Christmas University Challenge. ITV manages four shows directed by women, chiefly by virtue of running episodes of the popular soap operas Coronation Street and Emmerdale.But the commercial channel still does better than BBC One, which has just three women. One of those is the late Caroline Aherne, director of an acclaimed Christmas edition of her sitcom, The Royle Family, repeated on Christmas Eve.“The lack of representation of women directors in this year’s Christmas TV schedule shows how much more needs to be done to improve inclusion in the film and TV industries,” said Kevin Brennan MP, Labour’s shadow culture minister.The discrepancy evident this season can be partly explained by the traditional reliance on repeats of old favourites, such as a Two Ronnies episode, directed by Marcus Mortimer in 1993, or on vintage family films, such as Mary Poppins, directed by Robert Stevenson, and Joe Dante’s Gremlins. Yet men also feature heavily among the directors of the more recent family films being screened, such as Dan Scanlon’s 2013 Monsters University or the 2016 Disney cartoon Zootropolis, which was directed by three men.The two recent feature films made by women that will reach the small screen this Christmas date from 2011 and are both children’s animations. They are the Korean-American Jennifer Yuh Nelson’s Kung Fu Panda 2 and Sarah Smith’s Arthur Christmas, which she co-directed with Barry Cook. This supports the theory that it is easier for a woman to take the lead in children’s entertainment.The producers of funny shows and films also seem to be better at allowing women to take the creative helm. On Christmas Day, Debbie Isitt’s 2006 comedy Confetti will be screened on BBC Two, while Sharon Maguire’s hit Bridget Jones’s Diary will be shown on ITV.Reacting to the figures, Kaye Elliott, of the charity ScreenSkills, said that while “there is a way to go in terms of women directors”, it was also clear that targeted investment in areas of poor representation such as gender and ethnic background helped create opportunities. “It’s why we have run initiatives such as the drama directors programme with Directors UK to boost the number of women and other under-represented groups with practical experience and mentoring on prestige dramas,” said Elliott. “Obviously, there can be practical problems for women who also have caring responsibilities, given the intense schedules that are the norm in film and television. But these are issues that affect men, too. We are pleased to say that we have supported men as well as women to return to work after a parenting break through a scheme we have funded Film London to deliver.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cfa0ef09bc6c9e5a4fafa648949e8a2e290bb0c/0_282_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30c22c503e98d48522b5c30f07bae007","title":"scotland reporting guardian politics","story":"’s Scotland correspondent Libby Brooks reflects on the increased visibility of women, the huge variety to her role, and the things she is still learningWhen I describe my job as a bit like being the foreign correspondent next door, it can raise eyebrows. It’s definitely not my intention to suggest that Scotland is so bafflingly other – nor that my London newsroom is so embarrassingly ignorant of Caledonian matters – that pain-staking translation is needed. But, while a berth in Glasgow may not be as obviously foreign as a posting to Paris or Moscow or Delhi, it does share some essentials in as much as my job involves reporting a place that feels culturally as much as geographically distinct from street level.As the ’s Scotland correspondent, working alongside our Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, who is based in Edinburgh, I aim to reflect what’s concerning folk locally - when local does not mean within a two mile radius of Parliament Square – as well as what has impact nationally, or internationally. In explaining this country to the country next door, I often find myself writing about what Scotland does differently – most obviously through the ongoing ergence brought about by devolution, whether that’s the abolition of tuition fees in higher education, raising taxes for the wealthy or a new social security system that recognises welfare as a human right – as well as interrogating the impact of such policies. Free tuition has not, for example, significantly reduced the access gap for poorer students.Over the past year or so, I can think of examples of what Scotland does differently both good and bad: whether that is Glasgow’s pioneering work on knife crime, a landmark legal ruling on rape, the country’s shocking rate of drug-related deaths, or the Scottish government’s burgeoning private finance debt.Having grown up in Glasgow, I thought I understood the city I was returning to in May 2014, when I began a six-month secondment to assist Severin report the independence referendum campaign. I was wrong. Plunging into the feverish and politically complex atmosphere of the indyref was a near vertical learning curve. Four years later, after two seismic referendums and four election campaigns (two general, one Holyrood and one council), I still feel like there’s so much more to learn about this country.Having been so immersed in the vicissitudes of Westminster when I was editing on the opinion desk back in London, I discovered an entirely different climate in Scotland. Since the summer of 2014, we’ve tracked some of the most dramatic political shifts in the country’s history, not least the increasing support for the Scottish National party, which exploded after the independence referendum, the accompanying collapse in support for Scottish Labour and later the boost in popularity for the Scottish Conservatives under the leadership of Ruth Davidson.While it is of course essential to write with context, I’m also aware of the limits of regarding everything through the constitutional prism. Likewise, the swift and sharp online response when one is suspected of reporting in an even vaguely partisan fashion in either direction is an object lesson in the need to remain as scrupulously neutral as possible.One thing that immediately hit me was the visibility of women – when I arrived in the summer of 2014, the political landscape was crammed with impressive females – including Davidson, the then SNP deputy, now leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Labour’s Johann Lamont, as well as strong campaigning voices like Lesley Riddoch, Jeane Freeman and Clare Lally.I sometimes risk taking for granted the fact that Scotland’s first minister is a staunch feminist who is as comfortable offering a gender analysis of a policy as a constitutional one, or that I’ve worked with not one but two openly lesbian party leaders (Labour’s Kezia Dugdale and Davidson, who is currently on maternity leave after the birth of her first child).Nonetheless, this feminisation was by no means across all sectors. I was also shocked by the lack of women reporting politics – when I first entered the media tower at the Scottish parliament, I upped the female contingent there to three. Since then more women have joined the Holyrood lobby, and with a bunch of colleagues I helped set up the networking and campaigning organisation Women in Journalism Scotland, in 2016.One of the many reasons that I love my job is the variety: I can’t think of any other post where I’d find myself at a press conference with the first minister one day, the prime minister the next, then end the week discussing digital exclusion with a homeless outreach worker in Glasgow as the final tranche of universal credit transfers are rolled out across the city. It’s a truly privileged position to be in – to be reminded that the high politics have an impact on real lives, and to work for an organisation that will give equal weight to each story.But with that variety comes the agony of choice. There’s so much going on across the country, it’s fair to say that Severin and I could fill our working weeks thrice over quite comfortably. Part of the role is about deciding what and how to prioritise, and judging when a story has reached a sufficient level of interest that it will appeal to a global-facing newsdesk. It can also involve acting in a more directional capacity, suggesting potential columnists to the opinion desk or events to the culture desk, or providing some Scottish texture to our UK-wide reporting, whether that’s the demise of the high street or the anti-Trump protests.I know that readers don’t always agree with what we prioritise, and I’m always happy to hear why. In my early days on the Scotland beat I found Twitter and below the line prompts and suggestions invaluable – and occasionally face-saving (I’m looking at you Mae, Tenthred and Great Baldy).Over the past few years there’s been a significant shift in the centre of gravity of the , as it has opened offices across the US and Australia. I’ve watched the organisation becoming more global at the same time as it has become more local. With our Manchester office, ably headed up by our northern editor Helen Pidd, boosted by a clutch of new reporters since 2015, and Steve Morris and Rory Carroll doing their brilliant reporting across Wales, the south-west of England and Ireland, including Northern Ireland, it does feel like the entirety of the UK is now represented through our coverage like a stick of rock.The observant reader will note that my initial six-month secondment to Glasgow ended some time ago. The position of a second Scotland team member was made permanent in 2015, and I was utterly delighted to stay because – well, the story just kept getting better. I hope that I never take for granted the privilege of getting paid to ask interesting people (what I hope are) interesting questions and learning something new every day. Meanwhile, my toddler son is developing a broader Scottish accent than I have. Who knows what the future holds, but for now I have a sneaking suspicion that I didn’t know it was time to come home until I got there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3127b0214d69efab2b5a63db9beeb391198209b/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c28a943da84bcc327571d8c0a107b05f","title":"im an asylum seeker ive not been allowed to work for three years","story":"Rose was trafficked from Nigeria to work as a prostitute. She escaped and started a new lifeI was 21 when I was trafficked from Nigeria to London. I was helping out washing dishes in a cafe in Lagos when a woman promised to find me a job overseas. I kind of regarded her as a mother figure as my own mum had recently died from a terminal illness.I was tempted. I’d just gone through unbearable pain. Before my mum passed away, she’d suffered a lot of abuse from my father’s family when my dad died. My mum was blamed for his death. They called her a witch and accused her of killing my father. She was tortured. She was made to go through a process that no one should ever go through.Around the same time, I was being forced into an arranged marriage with an older man and made to undergo female genital mutilation. I ended up running away from my home town and moving to Lagos. I thought this woman would help change my fortunes that I’d move abroad and make money by helping out in a factory or cleaning houses and I could send money back to my 11-year-old sister.Instead I was shocked to discover that this woman had organised for me to be a prostitute. I was told that I had to pay back the money used to bring me here. It was less than human. It was against every basic belief and right that I knew. We weren’t allowed out on our own. There were always men guiding us. They made us swear an oath that we wouldn’t disappoint them. They abused us. We were forced to do unthinkable things. It was hellish.It only came to an end five years later when I was in a hair salon in Peckham, London, where I was allowed to spend time learning how to do African braids. A female customer came in and spoke Hausa, a language spoken back in Nigeria, and started asking me if this was my job. I ended up telling her my situation and she promised to help me. She came up with a plan to meet her one evening, and so I escaped and stayed with her. She was a cleaner and so at first I used to help out on her jobs. After a while I started fending for myself, and I met someone and we started a family.Since then I have applied for asylum so I can stay in the UK and the Home Office has moved myself and my son and daughter to Bradford. I’ve not been allowed to work for three years. I have always wanted to better myself by gaining some form of education and so last year I completed the level 2 diploma in health and social care. I was about to register for level 3 but the college said because of my status I am not eligible and so would have to pay the £4,300 myself. It broke my world. It reminded me that even though I’m safe, I’m still a prisoner. I don’t have freedom. I cannot work … I want my son and daughter, aged 10 and seven, to see me as someone doing something, not sat at home doing nothing. I’m grateful, but it’s not me.The house we live in is crumbling but at least we have a roof over our heads. We live off an allowance of £100 a week. The kids cannot get the basics they need. The money is mainly spent on food. My daughter was lagging behind in school, especially in maths, and so I enrolled her in private lessons. It’s £30 a week – it’s a big sacrifice but I want their futures to be better than mine.I’ve tried to integrate by joining the local church and volunteering at an Oxfam shop. I sometimes buy clothes there with my staff discount. I want my kids to see me doing something. We want the chance to work while we’re waiting. Idleness eats into your brain. At times I’ve been suicidal. I don’t want this life for myself. I could be working and contributing to the system. What they give is not enough. We want the chance to work ourselves. I want my kids to see me as a role model.Refugee Action helps refugees and people seeking asylum to build safe, happy, and productive lives in the UK.

Corbyn underlined the fact that he cannot set Labour’s policy unilaterally, saying: “I’m not a dictator of the party.”Twenty-four hours after the furore in the House of Commons in which he was accused of insulting the prime minister, the Labour leader appeared much more relaxed on a visit to the Hope Centre, a homelessness charity in Northampton whose campaign against eviction he is supporting.He admitted he had lost his temper when confronted with a wall of jeering Conservative MPs at prime minister’s questions after May had accused him of lacking a clear Brexit policy.“I was extremely angry: the last point I’d made was, they’d suddenly found £4bn to prepare for no deal. £4bn. At the same time, police officers have lost their jobs 100,000 vacancies in the NHS, a housing crisis a homeless man dies on the steps of Westminster and she and the Conservative party turned the whole thing into some pantomime joke,” he said.Conservative MPs challenged Corbyn’s claim that he muttered “stupid people” and not “stupid woman”, as many viewers of video footage believed.But he was unrepentant. “It’s interesting their sudden concern about these matters. Where is their concern about the homeless people of this country?” he said, repeatedly jabbing a finger on the table to emphasise his point.“Where is their concern about universal credit? Where is their concern about 200,000 children living in poverty in this country?”The prime minister was taunting Corbyn for declining to table a motion of no confidence in her government – as some shadow cabinet ministers wanted him to do.Instead, he exasperated many of his own MPs by putting down a symbolic motion criticising the prime minister – which the government refused to allow time to debate.“The reason I tabled the motion in the way I did was to try and maximise support around the specifics of the vote in the House,” he said. “The reason I took that judgment is I thought it was the best way and the best chance.”With the clock running down to 29 March, when Britain is due to leave the EU, a vocal group of Labour MPs – including some in the shadow cabinet – are pushing for the leadership to endorse the idea of a “people’s vote”.But asked if he could imagine a referendum emerging as a solution if it becomes clear that parliament is deadlocked – as the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, mooted this week – he said: “I think we should vote down this deal we should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”As to what stance Labour would take if a referendum were held, Corbyn said, “it would be a matter for the party to decide what the policy would be but my proposal at this moment is that we go forward, trying to get a customs union with the EU, in which we would be able to be proper trading partners.”And he struck a distinctly Eurosceptic note by again highlighting Labour’s concerns about the state aid rules that form part of the architecture of the single market.“I think the state aid rules do need to be looked at again, because quite clearly, if you want to regenerate an economy, as we would want to do in government, then I don’t want to be told by somebody else that we can’t use state aid in order to be able to develop industry in this country,” he said.Neither is he willing to countenance the idea that Labour should support May’s deal, to avoid Britain crashing out with no deal in place at all – a move the prime minister has repeatedly said is in the “national interest”.“The national interest is for parliament to have a vote on this deal now,” Corbyn said, pointing out that it was May who had pulled the vote, which MPs had agreed to hold on 11 December.“They reneged on that. And then she suddenly turns round and starts accusing us of playing politics with it. She’s the one that reneged on the deal. Not me.”In his party conference speech, Corbyn surprised some activists by saying Labour could back the prime minister’s deal if she secured a permanent customs union and offered stronger assurances on workers’ rights and environmental standards.He said that offer remains open. “It’s there: at no stage since I made that in October has the government been in touch with us at all.”“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”In Northampton, after hearing the personal stories of three of the Hope Centre’s clients, Corbyn said Labour would act quickly to end rough sleeping, which has more than doubled since 2010 to 4,751 – a figure charities believe is a drastic underestimate.The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, has announced that a Labour government would allocate £100m to buy emergency cold-weather accommodation for rough sleepers, part-funded by a levy on second homes.Corbyn said he would also repeal the Vagrancy Act of 1824, which criminalises rough sleeping and begging. It dates from the period of the Napoleonic wars, when destitute soldiers were returning from the battlefield – but was invoked almost 3,000 times in 2016.“It’s an absolute relic of the kind of politics of the Duke of Wellington, being used against people now, on the streets of this country. Can’t we just move on from the Duke of Wellington, and get rid of it?” he said.He said he was “very, very disappointed, and very sad” about the case of Onasanya, who was suspended from the party after being found guilty of repeatedly lying to avoid a speeding ticket.Onasanya, along with the Sheffield Hallam MP, Jared O’Mara, who remains an MP despite resigning from Labour, was selected for 2017’s snap election by a small panel of members of the party’s ruling national executive committee (NEC).“In any future election, we’ll have a much more democratic process,” Corbyn said. “It was no secret I was not happy with NEC panels selecting candidates.” He added, “I’m very determined that the party membership should be enfranchised in doing this. I’m very clear about that.”He said Labour was “very ready” to fight a general election, if the impasse at Westminster resulted in a snap poll – and asked if he was ready to become prime minister, he replied: “Yes. Absolutely.”He joked that he would take with him to Downing Street a reconditioned garden fork, bought during his visit from a social enterprise run from the Hope Centre’s workshop.Meanwhile, with business at Westminster suspended for the Christmas break, Corbyn said: “I’ve got an appointment with my allotment on Sunday.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c47868a8901fe2b9f6a111d86a057a44f4738a8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=642a51e76ab79a07c7734fb628aff956","title":"eu nations planning no deal brexit customs trade","story":"Don’t let the festive lull fool you: behind-the-scenes, no-deal Brexit contingency planning is accelerating around the EU. With not even 100 days before Britain leaves, and Downing Street ramping up its no-deal planning, the European commission last week unveiled bare-bones plans to keep flights in the air and money flowing should the UK crash out, warning that it would take all necessary steps to limit disruption for its members. A temporary nine-month regime, which the bloc can terminate unilaterally, would allow UK airlines to fly to the continent and back but not between EU cities. It would allow EU banks to clear transactions in the City, and allow British trucks to deliver goods into the EU.The EU’s executive arm also urged member states to be “generous” in protecting basic rights for the more than one million Britons on the continent by granting temporary residence permits to give them some security as they try to resolve their long-term status.No-deal preparations are most advanced in member states that would be most severely affected, including Ireland, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. Ireland last week published its contingency plans, conceding that they were at best “a damage limitation exercise”.Dublin’s concerns range from the economic impact of a slump in exports and the value of sterling to road haulage delays, skills shortages, smuggling and medicine supplies.France, too, which has passed legislation allowing it to pass emergency Brexit laws by decree, said its no-deal planning was well advanced. Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau said Paris was not readying the army, but preparations had been under way for “quite a while now for a hard Brexit – which is not what we want”.Key areas for pre-emptive action include:Countries with ports handling large volumes of UK trade – including Rotterdam, Antwerp, Zeebrugge, Calais and Hamburg – have been preparing for the risk of a no deal since soon after the referendum.France is hiring an extra 700 customs officers, expanding border control infrastructure such as checkpoints, roads and lorry parks, and building new warehousing in Calais, Cherbourg and at the entrance to the Channel tunnel.The Netherlands is taking on more than 900 extra customs officials and 145 vets – for checks on food, plant and animal products – at Rotterdam.Belgium is adding 140 customs officers, and Ireland is adding 1,000 extra staff for customs controls, sanitary and phytosanitary checks and export certification. The Irish government is also buying land near Dublin port for new border inspection bays, and parking for 270 trucks as they await checks, as well as offices for 144 staff. Similar preparations are underway at Rosslare port and Dublin airport.Shipping routes are also being expanded, and entirely new ones created, which would allow goods to be shipped smoothly between Ireland and Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain without ever having to enter the UK.EU companies using UK goods could face serious supply-chain problems if – as the EU has said would be the case – the bloc no longer recognised British standards after a no-deal exit. In such a case, companies would also face cost increases from transport delays.The Institute for Government thinktank lists many EU states that have already launched awareness campaigns for small- and medium-sized businesses, many of which have done little to prepare.Dublin’s Getting Ireland Brexit Ready website provides sector-by-sector advice, supplemented by practical roadshows, while the Dutch Brexit Impact Scan helps companies analyse and address their no-deal risks, with questions tailored to their business sector and relationship with the UK.Belgium has a similar impact assessment scheme, as do Denmark and France. France is also offering regional meetings to businesses addressing future customs arrangements. Poland has published a booklet offering information to businesses.The Irish and Dutch governments are so concerned about the possible impact on their companies that they are offering cash grants and vouchers worth between €2,500 and €1.5m to companies with a particularl exposure to the UK, to pay for specialist advice or help them look for new markets. It is unclear how far the full rights of British citizens living in the EU – such as access to healthcare, social benefits, pensions and family reunion – would be protected in the event of no deal.Partly because the EU27’s approach would be based on reciprocity – and therefore dependent on the UK’s treatment of EU nationals in Britain – no-deal preparations are less well advanced in citizens’ rights than in other areas.“It would seem very strange for us to make an exception and give the British resident in the EU a more favourable situation than EU citizens resident in the UK,” Loiseau said last week.France is among several countries promising some degree of unilateral action to preserve UK citizens’ rights, including passing legislation to allow British nationals working in the French public sector to keep their jobs.Germany has drafted legislation that should allow UK nationals to escape a ban on non-EU citizens holding dual nationality, as long as they apply before the end of the transition period.Many EU27 consulates in the UK have organised internet seminars and created web portals for their citizens living in Britain on the legal rights of both them and their partners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8cfdbfbdf24b86b8f4a16b3b97259ae42bba65/17_167_2320_1391/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=189c5ee8a13b137eb967f1688c5da419","title":"frankie boyle review 2018 forget brexit","story":"It’s been tough to find much to laugh about this year. But Britain’s most savage satirist is going to give it a go...Consider the plight of the satirist. I know you’ve got your own plight, and there are only so many plights that you can consider at any one time, and that the plight of the satirist might even seem to you to be one of the easier plights. A satirist, you imagine, is having a pretty heavy week if they do more than pop up on The News Quiz to say that every MP in the DUP looks like a committee member of a bowling club who’s just seen a visitor enter the bar wearing jeans. And now that you put it like that, yes, you’re right, it’s not much of a plight at all, really.The plight of the satirist, such as it is, is a compulsion to look at the grimmest, most important thing they can think of, and then for reasons that probably wouldn’t survive a really good therapist, try to make it funny. To try to address the iniquities of their society, the satirist must manufacture some hope that what they’re doing might make a difference, then type it all up and send it off somewhere before they remember that it never does. Looking back over the events of this year is a bit like holding a doll for a therapist and pointing to where the bad man hurt you. Among the lowlights were:1 Theresa May dancing on stage at the Conservative Party conference (choreographer Ray Harryhausen), looking like an uncloaked Dementor on a hen weekend.2 A group of deranged kippers burning a cardboard effigy of Grenfell tower. They were later quizzed by police, and Kensington and Chelsea council, who asked them to quote for some public housing projects. 3 A senate grilling of Mark Zuckerberg, who gave the general impression of a Batman villain whose backstory is being given puberty-delaying drugs by a paedophile, and who seemed visibly relieved to be questioned on privacy concerns rather than Facebook’s monopoly power.4 The continuing media fascination with Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man who has all the authenticity of a character at a murder-mystery weekend.5 Philip Hammond delivering a budget speech so dry it was sponsored by Vagisil, making watching for 75 minutes feel like a gateway drug for necrophilia.6 The hilarious emergence of the phrase “rules-based international order”, which I like to imagine pronounced with the jaded, lisping irony of Gore Vidal, drunk on his deathbed.7 The Palestinian right-of-return marches that demonstrated the old Israeli proverb, you can’t make an omelette without shooting protesters. Trump said the US was “fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement”. The lasting peace that will come about once Israel has shot all the Palestinians.Beyond that, the year broke down into four seemingly unending and increasingly apocalyptic chapters.Domestically, the year was dominated by the Conservative party successfully externalising its bitter isions on trade. They have never, in their whole history, not been fighting about trade: trade laws are to the Tory party what ownership of the Queen Vic is to EastEnders.Theresa May was always only a placeholder prime minister, something that would appear to make about as much sense as using a slice of Victoria sponge as a bookmark. At the time of going to press, she had survived a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs, and there was the general impression that European leaders had agreed to end freedom of movement just to stop her from visiting them. Throughout the year, Boris Johnson has maintained that dishevelled, confused look of the people at the end of a disaster movie being ferried to the ambulances. He resigned as foreign secretary in July, barking “Chequers is dead” as if he were in an Agatha Christie novel and had just discovered the body of the butler at the bottom of the stairs. Johnson has promised a bonfire of EU regulations, a teetering one, without fencing and namby-pamby safety glasses, so that we can wipe the drifting cinders from our newly liberated eyes screaming, “Fuck you, Brussels! Maybe I want to be blind!” I look forward to a UK without EU red tape, and vegans weeping in supermarkets that resemble a cross between a botanical freak show and a fruit-and-veg hospice.I say, let’s forget the worries of Brexit for a week or two, and just enjoy our last Christmas with running water. Brexit has many downsides, but I think it will be nice for the Irish to watch a British famine. Personally I look forward to a new age where the London Christmas lights won’t be turned on by vacuous celebrities, but by someone found guilty of “talking foreign” and sentenced to complete the circuit. A time where we no longer guess the fluctuations of the market, but our high priests stare into polished heads, newly bald from radiation sickness, and interpret the patterns cast by the light of flickering sewer-fat candles.Paradoxically, I think Brexit will actually lead to less nationalism: economic collapse meaning that borders lose all their current toxicity, as they’re constantly redrawn in a never-ending struggle between regional warlords, antibiotic-resistant microbes and organ-harvesting cyborgs. Our children will have less inclination to dwell on skin colour as they’ll be preoccupied with appeasing the whims of some pitiless, scab-encrusted Cyclops waving a horse’s hoof nailed to a broomstick, roaring for fresh meat as he plays his three-note national anthem on a ribcage xylophone.It is at times like those that we will remember the work of Dominic Raab, who resigned in November, having decided that he could not endorse a deal that he himself had negotiated. Raab didn’t want to be Brexit secretary, but he didn’t have the negotiating skills to decline the job. When Raab took over, I was heartened by the thought that negotiations were being handled by someone with the air of an embattled leisure centre manager, who could be outmanoeuvred by a statue of Stephen Hawking. Surely better withdrawal terms have been negotiated during prison sex. Much of the Brexit discourse has revolved around people who seem inbred telling us that ersity is bad, but there don’t seem to be any easy solutions. In a way, I envy the touching optimism of people who feel that another referendum might clear up all this bad feeling once and for all.The Labour party somehow managed to achieve a Brexit position more incoherent than a government of opportunists at war with itself. There is definitely something odd about Labour supporting free movement for goods and not, well, labour. Meanwhile, May tried to attack Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of antisemitism while in the middle of the Windrush scandal, which was like Pol Pot complaining about gender balance in the films of Martin Scorsese. Corbyn has mastered a lot of things, but strangely not saying shit just to get elected. Mate, say some shit just to get elected: it’s really your only job right now. This needs to go to the top of your to-do list, not somewhere down below “fix the spare room door”.And yet, he has undoubtedly been travestied by a press who must somehow contrive to terrify Middle England with a man who looks as if he celebrates New Year’s Eve by edging the lawn. Corbyn was attacked in August after the Daily Mail printed pictures of him laying a wreath for some Palestinian martyrs. Corbyn argued that, just because he was near the graves of terrorists, didn’t mean he was honouring terrorists. Personally, I’m surprised our politicians find the time to lay so many wreaths when not one of them has poured liquor on the ground for Tupac.Perhaps some idea of how Britain intends to deal with the post-Brexit world is encapsulated in the Dickensian figure of the secretary of state for international trade, Dr Liam Fox, a man for whom Another Day, Another Dollar means the proposed minimum wage in our trade agreement with the US. You might wonder how a former doctor can cheerfully promote arms sales. Luckily, Liam’s brain has plenty of experience hosting seemingly irreconcilable contradictions: such as believing we should all stand on our own two feet, while claiming expenses of three pence for a 100-metre car journey in 2012. Liam Fox manages to be a grotesque moral nihilist and yet, somehow, not even the worst Dr Fox. Like me, he was raised on an Irish Catholic council estate in Scotland. It’s these sliding-doors moments where I have to thank alcoholism for denying me the focus to become a genocidal sociopath.Yet perhaps the clearest signpost to post-Brexit Britain this year lay in Boris Johnson, and later Prince Andrew, advocating the procurement of a new Royal Yacht. Andrew said that, for British exports, it would be a tool in the bag – despite having never used a tool, or carried a bag. There is no doubt that having Prince Andrew on such a boat could boost Britain’s reputation, provided it never docks.Of course it’s hardly the first ship the royals have had: that burned up entering the atmosphere after their journey here from their home planet, Azeroth 9. But how do you respond to the monarchy asking for a £100m boat? The history of European royalty suggests they’re going to be well ahead of any suggestion to “go fuck themselves”. On balance, I say stick with the royal train: we can always add an international dimension just by extending the tracks into the sea.The murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia is another very difficult subject to find the lighter side of, unless someone in the Ecuadorean embassy has clipped the story out and stuck it to the fridge. The 15 Saudi suspects have been banned from entering the UK, which is a shame as the people this hurts the most are the box office staff at Salisbury Cathedral. Turkey wants the murderers tried there, possibly because sticking journalist killers into a Turkish jail will really tidy up the lifers’ wing.You can imagine that this is all quite surreal for the Saudis they behead people in public, and starve the children of Yemen. The idea that they would be lambasted for killing a fully grown man in private with no witnesses must seem ridiculous it would be as if I had got into trouble for saying someone looked like a spoon.The murder was such a calamitous fuck-up from start to finish, I like to think that it’s got David Davis’s fingerprints all over it. Considering the version of events that the Saudis were willing to push, I’d love to see the ones they rejected. “We regret to inform you that Mr Khashoggi perished while attempting to rape an outboard motor.” They killed Khashoggi with a bone saw. No wonder they need to buy arms: their own weaponry seems to be sourced from the Whoops! shelf at Homebase.We apparently “share values” with the Saudis. After they behead someone (48 in the first four months of the year), they sometimes crucify the body in the public square for three days. Watching a horror movie in Saudi Arabia must have all the adrenaline buzz of a local council meeting. I’m guessing the most horrifying film you could screen there would be a remake of The Dukes of Hazzard where Daisy Duke drives her own car.Our government was angry about Khashoggi and sent the Saudis a strongly worded arms invoice. Perhaps it’s unfair to expect Britain to criticise the Saudis. Can we be expected to take the moral high ground when it comes to royal families sanctioning murder? Sadly, the only long-term consequences of Khashoggi being killed will be that, in future, when a Saudi diplomat orders a pizza, the Deliveroo rider will kick it the last few feet to the front door. Despite the long-running, disgraceful and illegal war in Yemen, there is no sign from Britain of a moratorium on weapons sales. So Britain, an international arms dealer, censuring someone for using its products would be as hypocritical as that bit when Willy Wonka rolls his eyes at Augustus Gloop.Saudi’s war in Yemen struggles to get much coverage here, despite the significant role Britain plays sometimes it seems that only journalists getting killed will engage the British press. In the US, the worst person you can kill would be a cop in China, a government official and in the UK, woe betide you if you touch anyone who’s mastered Pitman shorthand.Perhaps the saddest part of this whole business is knowing that there are so few British journalists committed enough to get murdered: you could silence most just by breaking the fingers they use to do select all, copy, paste. Nobody’s going to flay you to death just for barking offers of money through the letterboxes of recently bereaved parents, or trawling for offensive tweets with your free hand. Of course, there are a lot of good journalists. Perhaps journalist is now just too broad a term, in much the way the word actor encompasses everyone from Meryl Streep to Sooty.There’s no point asking how UK arms dealers sleep at night after watching footage from Yemen, as they’ll reply, “Very well: in fact my erection even stops me rolling out of bed.” Yet shouldn’t we, as a society, demand better? If we can set aside the moral element here (and I don’t know that we can, but just as an exercise in trying to recognise the sheer breadth of our current futility, it might prove useful), Britain sees its interests as almost synonymous with an industry that isn’t labour intensive, or environmentally sustainable, and that seems to be riddled with corruption, because it reminds us of what it was like to be powerful.Of course Donald Trump trundled out in front of the cameras like a corpse on a Segway and announced: “We are with Saudi Arabia, we are staying with Saudi Arabia.” I honestly think that the Republican establishment is just coming to terms with how useful Trump is – realising that this troll-doll King Lear, who looks like something you’d pick off a baking tray after cooking pizza above it, can say the things that they themselves would like, or find useful to say, but can’t because of some vestigial attachment to decency. The Republicans’ current attitude to Trump is of turning a blind eye to your racist builder because you just need to get the conservatory finished.Trump has not refashioned the GOP in his own image. He has achieved something more significant: he has managed to maintain a semantic distance from the Republican party despite cheerfully delivering its agenda. Meanwhile, the Democratic establishment has chosen to mirror his attachment to nepotism, entitlement and conspiracy theory – not that the conspiracy theory is necessarily invalid. Trump might, I suppose, be a Russian spy: it would certainly explain why he can’t speak English. It’s not that he’s normalising his own behaviour it’s that, by comparison, he’s normalising that of dreadful people everywhere. Jared Kushner, a bloodless, lipless demon, a dependent clause of the Anti-Life Equation who could be thrown into any Edgar Allan Poe adaptation and trusted to improvise, looks merely emo in comparison.The racial animus that Trump has cynically aggravated saw his supporters protesting Nike’s Colin Kaepernick advert in September. The Nike swoosh is now the sound their products make when they go on fire. One patriot filmed himself destroying his Nike clothing by cutting off the top couple of inches from his socks. Instead of destroying the clothing, he’s created an additional, free set of Nike sweatbands.What does it say about our times that we’re expected to look for moral guidance to corporations like Nike, whose brand message of “Just do it” started out as a looped PA announcement in their Vietnamese trainer factory. I’ve always been wary of Nike – I think because their single tick logo is so reminiscent of the one used in my youth for Bob a Job: just a glimpse of a trainer and I’m back in short trousers, fibre-glassing that pensioner’s loft for a shiny 50 pence piece. (If you’re interested it was 10p for the insulating, 40p for wearing the shorts.)Despite Trump’s rage, the taking-a-knee protests have continued. It’s odd, in most cultures going down on a knee is considered respectful: personally, I expect either a proposal or a medley of hits from Oklahoma. You have to hand it to the president it shows a certain ambition to try to undermine the idea of protest in a country that was founded by, well, Protestants. Trump has tried to make this about respect for a flag I very much doubt he could draw from memory, and for military service that he studiously avoided.Of course the NFL players are not actually protesting the flag. That would be as pointless as arguing with a sock, screaming at a table cloth, or a whole bunch of other stuff Trump probably does on a daily basis. The protest was originally about racial justice, and black people being shot dead by the police. You have to ask yourself how abusive a relationship has to be if even kneeling in silence is too provocative, how you are valued in a country where even the statement that your life matters ignites furious dissent.There is an obvious misogyny to the Trump administration, and the president no doubt has many supporters whose idea of foreplay consists of dropping a rope ladder down a well. This was highlighted by the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court, despite a confirmation hearing where he unspooled like a Columbo villain, bellowing endlessly about his love of beer. Trump ordered an FBI probe during the hearing, an investigation that was concluded with the speed of an airplane edit of CSI Miami. An investigation that ranged from the FBI agent looking at himself in the mirror and noting that Judge Kavanaugh wasn’t at that moment raping him, all the way through to noting that he hadn’t raped anyone during his time on television being questioned by senators.With Kavanaugh now on the bench, the irony for American women is that huge amounts of beer will soon become their only means of abortion. Should he be any kind of judge? There’s an argument that the very last thing you want to hand to any man accused of sex crimes is a hammer, but then again maybe we need his hands where we can see them. Still, it certainly is a very scary time for young men in America. Especially the ones aged 10 that Trump has put in cages.A climate of fearAt least Trump, looking like a cross between Dr Frankenstein’s first attempt and a tiebreak dinner for the contestants on I’m A Celebrity, came up with the solution to politicians only ever making short-term policies: he made sure there will only be a short term. This year he appointed a former energy lobbyist as head of the environmental protection agency, and announced his intention to change regulations that prohibited new coal burning plants. My guess is that the only concession Republicans plan to make to global warming will be to change the lyrics of America The Beautiful to “…from sea to boiling sea”.Climate catastrophe is imminent. Climate change could decimate pollinating species, leading to a world starved of fruit and vegetables. The best way to alert the world to that danger is to hold the next climate conference in Coatbridge, a town so short of fibre many residents can only shit successfully with the aid of a corkscrew. Perhaps we should try to look on the bright side. The colossal internet servers that provide the architecture for the modern world’s de-socialisation are based above the Arctic Circle. Should they burn out through lack of natural cooling, maybe people will look up from their phones and withered genitalia to once more make eye contact.The death of the planet seems almost too big to take in, doesn’t it? The real tragedy is not that we can’t prevent it. The real tragedy, I think, lies in the fact that we can. There are a lot of things we can change through political action, some small, some large, that would add up to saving the Earth.Consider again the plight of the children starving in Yemen. It’s a hard thing to consider. It’s OK to admit that, I think – that it’s hard to empathise: you don’t know much about it, you have your own plight, and it’s a difficult thing to think about. To consider that, in a world that has pub lunches, wristwatches, golden retrievers, the novels of Donna Tartt, the music of Kendrick Lamar, flumes and The Amazing Spider-Man, there is still a plight where you starve to death, as a child, for no reason.I mean, there is a reason, that I suppose has somehow made itself too obvious to mention. The reason is that some people are addicted to money and power, many of them pathologically so, and we let them do what they like. In our name, and with our taxes, we let them kill who they like in the service of their bored, baroque perversity, because we don’t care enough to stop them. We cannot seem to rouse ourselves, even as they move to turn the world into a consuming flame. We are running out of time to save the children of Yemen, and ourselves – and yet we could still, in theory, be redeemed.

As well as editing London’s biggest circulation daily paper, he has a £650,000-a-year role working one day a week for the investment fund Blackrock, and is chairman of a panel of advisers to Exor, an Italian holding company worth $24bn. He has also taken on academic posts, and earned hundreds of thousands making speeches to financiers.Tackled over his political legacy, Osborne denied that his austerity policies were behind a rise in homelessness and poverty, insisting that people were more likely to stop him in the street to take issue with hikes to VAT and stamp duty and getting rid of tax breaks for “non-domicile” residents - before quickly adding that that was what he “got from people in wealthy Kensington”, where the Evening Standard’s offices are located.“The tax rises that I either introduced or attempted to introduce turned out to be the most controversial,” he said. “The public expenditure savings were a necessary part of the package of getting this country back on its feet.”The rise in homelessness was a consequence of bad policy, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/168d139211d229138ebda58d1e8f8c708e327c90/30_58_2865_1719/master/2865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8da75a1e46f07bee17971d63284b495","title":"mps whatsapp chats jeremy corbyn","story":"It’s how plots are hatched, deals are done and party lines agreed – but what really gets said in Westminster’s notorious WhatsApp groups?If you ever get the chance, take time to observe MPs sitting in the House of Commons. Roughly half will be paying some kind of attention to the debate the rest will be on their phones. Of these, some will be on Twitter, either to compose bons mots or check the number of retweets and likes they have got. A few will be checking they still exist: I once caught Julian Huppert, a Lib Dem MP up until the 2015 general election, Googling himself during a select committee hearing.Most, though, are likely to be on WhatsApp, the messaging service, advancing their careers or targeting the downfall of someone else’s. In the past, most plotting was done in Westminster’s bars and private rooms. Now it’s done via WhatsApp. When you hear a succession of government spokespeople appear on the radio and the TV using much the same language to talk down the significance of some new crisis, such as the resignation last month of transport minister Jo Johnson, it is not due to an outburst of spontaneous consensus. Rather, it is the result of a WhatsApp network agreeing a party line for everyone to repeat for media consumption.The advantage of WhatsApp is that it is securely encrypted, meaning that politicians feel free to express what they really think, rather than what they would like people to think they think. WhatsApp is politicians unplugged. Which isn’t to say that WhatsApp messages never get leaked, only that they get leaked on purpose. There are the groups whose contents are designed to remain confidential, and there are the groups in which everyone knows there are one or two members who are unable to prevent themselves from blabbing to the press.The trick for any politician is to keep track of which WhatsApp group is which, and to post the right message to the right group. Sometimes this is easier said than done. There is the cabinet WhatsApp group, the Leave-supporting cabinet “Monday Pizza Nights” group. There’s the Remain-supporting Tory backbenchers. There’s the 70-strong European Research Group (ERG), led by Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg. There is the shadow cabinet. There are the unofficial opposition of Labour moderates. Then there are the known unknowns. And almost certainly the unknown unknowns.What do they talk about? Handily, I’ve taken a peek at what might have been some of the key chats of this tumultuous year.Jacob Rees-Mogg How many letters of no confidence do we have now?JRM That’s what I’m worried about.SB OK, well, at least 50…SB On my life, we’ve got 40 nailed on. Cross my heart and hope to die.JRM Very well. So you’re saying that if I, too, were to submit a letter to the 1922 committee, then others would follow and we would reach the 48 we need to trigger a leadership challenge?SB Count on it. I’ll organise a press conference outside parliament.Boris Johnson I hope you don’t mind me butting in. I’m behind you all the way. I see this as a huge opportunity in our nation’s history for me to become prime minister. I’ve had my hair cut specially.SB Sorry about that. I got my fours and twos muddled up. I thought we had 42 letters and it was only 24.JRM You’ve made me look a nincompoop. We need a plan B.SB I think we actually need a plan A.JRM Your literacy is better than your numeracy.

We could get rid of this backstop agreement forever by just starving the Irish into submission.JRM Expletives help no one, Mark. And while I personally have some sympathy for starving the Irish, I think we need to be very careful about stirring up the historical legacy of the potato famine.PP Why? Whoever heard of a potato going hungry?JRM So our plan is just to say no to everything and hope that sooner or later something happens?

Our plan remains unchanged.KS But the Tories have pulled the meaningful vote…JC Have they? We still stand firm. Our priority is to promise a Brexit that delivers on the will of the people by offering the country a whole lot of things the Tories are not offering and which the EU won’t give us.KS But that isn’t an alternative plan?JM Then we shall be demanding a general election with me as leader of the Labour party…JC Hang on a minute, aren’t I the leader?JM Yes, of course. But the media do quite like me.KS Guys, guys, there isn’t going to be a general election. The Tories and the DUP aren’t going to bring down the government. We need to have a position on the second referendum.JC We’ve got one. All options are on the table…KS But what does that mean. Are we for one or against one? And do we want to stay in the EU or leave?JC I’ve got to go.

I’ve been spending the weekend stockpiling some medicines for a friend of my mother-in-law.Amber Rudd Well, I believe the prime minister has secured a deal that is the best on offer and is right for the country, and we should all jolly well get behind her to help her get it through parliament.Jeremy Hunt Chill out, Ambs! We all know you’re thrilled to be back in the cabinet. No one’s listening. The PM never checks this group.

You were sacked weeks ago.DR I resigned, actually.AL I must have forgotten to delete you.Andrea Leadsom removed Dominic Raab from the group.AL Does anyone know who the new Brexit secretary is?Gavin Williamson Haven’t a clue. I’ve been spending the past few weeks trying to flog off the last few hundred fireplaces I’ve got in storage. If anyone fancies one, I can offer a good deal.Penny Mordaunt I think it’s Stephen Bartley.AL Still not ringing any bells. But I’ll add him anyway,Andrea Leadsom added Stephen Barclay to the group.Stephen Barclay Hi chaps. The PM has just phoned me to say she definitely has no intention of pulling the vote and has sent me on to Marr to reassure MPs.SJ Yup. She’s definitely pulling the vote.Michael Gove Actually, the PM has also phoned me to say the vote is going ahead. Let’s speak later, after I’ve told the Today programme what’s going on.PH I can’t believe Mikey has fallen for it, too.SJ Me, neither. He’s going to look such an idiot. But good news for my leadership bid...AR It’s been confirmed the PM is pulling the vote.PH Who would have guessed?Chris Grayling Sorry to be late on this. My train got cancelled. Have I missed anything?PH Only your entire life.Jeremy Wright Do I exist or am I just a hologram?SJ No one knows.AR Pull yourselves together, everyone. I think Theresa has absolutely done the right thing. The best deal on offer wasn’t the best deal on offer and it’s important she goes back to Brussels to negotiate a better deal that can’t be bettered.AL On the plus side, pulling the debate gives us more time to scrutinise the Lords’ amendments to the ivory bill.PM Does anyone have a plan?JH Forget the DMs. Anyone who wants to back my leadership bid gets first pick of their cabinet job.SJ Same goes for me.AR What about you, Philip?PH I’ll be fine. I took out a huge bet on sterling going down and the stock market tumbling. Happy days!SJ Fuck. The ERG have got the 48 letters. There’s going to be a no-confidence vote, after all.AR Now is the time for us to all get behind...JH Oh, do give it a rest, Amber. How much longer are we lumbered with Theresa for?PH No one knows.

Our members and voters are overwhelmingly pro-European. This lets them, and our country, down.”Corbyn told the  that if the parliamentary deadlock over May’s withdrawal agreement sparked a general election in the new year he would “go back and negotiate (with the EU) and see what the timetable would be”.Asked about a second referendum, favoured by many of his MPs and Labour supporters, he added: “It would be a matter for the party to decide what the policy would be, but my proposal at this moment is that we go forward, trying to get a customs union with the EU in which we would be able to be proper trading partners.”Labour passed a motion at its party conference in Liverpool in September that it would seek a general election as its first choice, but left open the option of supporting a second referendum.“Jeremy Corbyn has finally come off the fence he’s been sat on for the past two years,” he said. “But unfathomably he’s come down on the same side as Theresa May. The Labour party is incapable of providing opposition to the worst UK government that most people can remember.”The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, added that Corbyn “refuses once again to take the blinkers off”, with the party’s policy indistinguishable from the Conservatives’.“He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy,” he said. “On Brexit, you simply cannot put a cigarette paper between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd7296352e44dfb7081cf16a442b23465d583426/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f13ac0caa43cd52fa1d4b528bf7315a","title":"uk nationals in berlin given assurance of residency in event of no brexit deal","story":"Britons promised a ‘very generous’ offer though not told what status they would getBritish nationals living in Berlin have been reassured that an urgent registration process to secure legal status will be in place for them in the event of the UK leaving the EU with no deal.Worried Britons who attended a meeting hosted by the British embassy said they felt relief that the state authorities had been able to go further than the European commission, whose no-deal planning announced this week made them feel abandoned.There are an estimated 100,000 Britons living in Germany, the majority of them working, but they fear they will be treated as third-country nationals after Brexit, last in the queue for jobs after Germans and EU nationals, as is the legal norm for people from outside the bloc who apply for work.Berlin recently overtook North Rhine-Westphalia as the state with the most UK nationals with 18,000, the ambassador said in his opening remarks.Engelhard Mazanke, the head of the foreigners registration office at the Berlin state office for citizens, told Britons that he could not say what kind of residence status they would get when the UK leaves the EU, or what documents would be required.He promised, however, that the immigration office would clarify the situation as soon as possible and be “very generous” with UK nationals in Berlin who have to go through the federal legislative process to establish their new status.He told them it would take eight weeks for the immigration office in Berlin to issue residence permits and that it would not be possible before 29 March, but he reassured Britons in the audience that the city had an “excellent, flexible team which coped with the refugee crisis two years ago”.He told them that Britons would be able to register their personal details on an official website by the second week of January, to help establish that they have a continued right to live and work in the state in the event of no deal.One British national at the meeting said they felt that at last someone had listened to them after two years of anxiety. “His statement is remarkable, in my view because he, as the first of the heads of the immigration offices in Germany, is willing to come out at this stage and put Brits’ minds at rest,” the source said.France also sought to reassure British nationals of their post-Brexit status.The Europe minister, Nathalie Loiseau, said the country would guarantee the residence, employment and welfare rights of the 160,000 British citizens living there provided that Britain offered the same guarantees to French expatriates.The campaign group British in Europe, which is chaired by the Berlin-based lawyer Jane Golding, wrote on its website on Saturday that “a ministerial decree would be adopted and British citizens would have a three-month transition period post March 2019, during which they would be exempt from needing whichever new status would ultimately apply to UK citizens in Germany”.Golding said that UK nationals would still be losing some of their rights and called on Brussels and London to do more to ensure those affected retained those rights whatever the deal.“There are some unanswered questions and we will be following up with the relevant authorities in the new year. We also know that there is still some EU-wide coordination going on behind the scenes. But it shouldn’t be left up to the EU27 to give us reassurances, which is where a no-deal leaves us.“The responsibility falls squarely on the UK government to do all it can to make sure its citizens, wherever they live, are protected,” she said.Brussels has urged European governments to take a generous approach to protecting the rights of 1 million Britons living in the EU if the UK leaves without a deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1032ad628073600d169305946eb933df06ff462e/0_59_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10a802dc9d62b7624130f3dcbea38d15","title":"exeter saracens premiership match report","story":"• Exeter 31-13 Saracens• Champions’ 22-match unbeaten runs comes to an endChristmas comes around about as often as Saracens lose matches these days but there was absolutely no festive cheer on offer for the league leaders in Devon. After 22 matches unbeaten in all competitions the Premiership champions were abruptly dragged back to earth by a fiercely motivated Chiefs side who, for now, have replaced their rivals at the top of the domestic tree.The foundations of Exeter’s best result of the season were again laid up front, with Saracens ultimately finishing second best in areas they usually dominate. Luke Cowan-Dickie, promoted to start at the 11th hour, made a striking return at hooker opposite England’s Jamie George, Scotland’s Sam Skinner delivered another fine performance and the significant impact of Harry Williams and Ben Moon off the bench left Saracens with nowhere to go.Perhaps the most telling snapshot of the day came as Chiefs’ pack rampaged over for a close-range penalty just as a weary Mako Vunipola and George were walking towards the main stand having been replaced. A last-minute converted score from Matt Kvesic also secured the Chiefs a bonus point which puts them three points clear at the top.Cowan-Dickie was only drafted in to start at short notice after the Chiefs’ captain Jack Yeandle had to withdraw before kick-off through illness and Saracens’ skipper Brad Barritt was also forced off prematurely having taken a blow to the back the head at a breakdown at the start of the second quarter. With Michael Rhodes also suffering a shoulder injury and both Maro Itoje and Billy Vunipola currently sidelined, the champions are showing some signs of wear and tear.Prior to Barritt’s departure Saracens had been largely in control thanks to an early brace of penalties from Farrell but the game’s momentum then started to shift. The Chiefs finally worked their way into the visitors’ 22 but were frustrated when a penalty kick to the corner and a lineout move down the blindside ended with Cowan-Dickie being forced into touch. Saracens’ relief proved short-lived, however, when Skinner charged down Ben Spencer’s clearance and Cowan-Dickie gleefully collected the rebound to score.Saracens’ early composure was starting to fray with winger Alex Lewington enduring a particularly torrid 40 minutes beneath the high ball and their lineout starting to creak. Exeter, though, saw two more lineout drives repelled and, with the scrums growing increasingly messy, there was no further scoring until Steenson slotted a penalty from in front of the posts with the final kick of the half.Chiefs’ 10-6 half-time lead was hardly imposing but in a tight, gritty contest it had real psychological value. Even with the giant Will Skelton on for Rhodes, it was the Chiefs who exerted the majority of the pressure in the third quarter, with the sight of the lightly-built Steenson forcing Vunipola back in the tackle indicative of the hosts’ mindset. Long before the end, with Williams bagging another powerful try for his collection and Ben Spencer’s consolation effort trumped by Kvesic’s final flourish, there was only one side in it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0564f55d9a3dc1fcb50203040bbb19aa392b7708/0_144_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6835ee35d101f67cc6b37d184e256bd4","title":"snap snapchat android technology","story":"Don’t suggest to executives at Snap, parent of the Snapchat app, that they work for a social network, or that they’re in the social media space. “It’s a communications platform, not a social network,” says Claire Valoti, international vice-president of Snap.You might think that an app where you create media – photos with captions and effects – and then send that to a selection of friends and acquaintances (where it self-deletes) sounds like social media. But Snapchat wants to distance itself from rivals such as Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, which this year were the focus of so much negative attention for their effects on democracies, cyberbullying, or invasion of privacy.For 2019, making that distinction seems to be an important part of the company’s message. But as it looks back on 2018, where it recorded losses of more than $1bn (£790m) on revenues of just $791m in the first three quarters, the clear target is to improve revenues and head towards profitability. It aims to do that in two ways: by getting more users who own smartphones running Google’s Android software and by delivering more adverts to all its users through “programmatic” advertising bought automatically by ad agencies.Having created Snapchat in 2011, based on an app idea for “ephemeral messaging” that he had at Stanford University, Evan Spiegel brought Snap to market in March 2017, valued at $33bn. Since then the stock has mostly slid downhill, to a valuation in mid-December of $7.3bn it has yet to have a profitable quarter.Snap faces two problems in its struggle for profitability. First, Snapchat doesn’t have enough users to reach critical mass with advertisers. It isn’t quite an essential destination, even for the young demographic that predominantly uses it they also spend huge amounts of time on YouTube, which has all the heft of Google’s algorithms behind it. Snapchat had 186 million daily active users (DAUs) in the third quarter of 2018. Twitter doesn’t release a DAU figure, but claimed 326 million monthly active users. Facebook, with Instagram, has 1.5 billion DAUs.The other problem is that Snapchat doesn’t get enough revenue from the users it does have. In the third quarter, advertising on Facebook’s two ad-supported services, Facebook and Instagram, generated $35.39 per user in North America, $11.75 in Europe and $4.29 in the Asia-Pacific region. Even users beyond those three regions generated $2.81 each. Twitter generated $5.19 per US user, though only $1.17 per international user.Snapchat languished at $2.62 in revenue per North American user, and $0.85 for all those beyond half of Twitter’s figure in the US, and less than a tenth of Facebook’s.But Snapchat presently has more users on iPhone than on Android, which stunts its revenue potential. “We have been very vocal about making it better on Android,” Valoti says. There might be other revenue sources. Snap is also preparing a second version of its “Spectacles” – a goofy pair of glasses that could take 10 seconds of video and share it via the app – after they failed to take off first time around.Now it’s looking to come back. “When Evan is asked about where the future is heading, he will talk about computing being layered over the world,” says Valoti. “The camera is the computer, it’s the link with the world. We believe in the future it won’t just be through your smartphone. Spectacles are part of that strategy.”So will be the measure of success or failure in a year’s time? “Growing the number of Android users,” says Valoti. Android users, it’s over to you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd2588c2dddb2a1e14531ad85a679dbcc0c41795/0_352_6809_4086/master/6809.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd8c1e9e38e54fd5e8140185c8c07f93","title":"readers travel photography competition december winners","story":"Our final selection of the year ranges from New York cops to Venice shops, camel fairs to penguins.

It now owes $9.2m on a note due in October 2019 but donations have slowed and attempts to secure a state government grant have met determined resistance.In a statement, the foundation said a sale may be necessary. Negotiations and fundraising continue: a GoFundMe page had by Saturday raised a little over $33,000. But material is being culled for potential debt reduction “without selling off core items”.The museum contains riches: examples of Lincoln’s earliest known writings his presidential seal, with wax remnants from its last use an 1839 legal brief that contains the signatures of Lincoln for the plaintiff and his rival Stephen A Douglas for the defence the blood-soaked kid gloves the 16th president had in his pocket when he was killed.But it also contains many items that could be considered expendable. For example, there are five dozen playbills, letters and lithographs which belonged to Junius Brutus Booth, the father of Lincoln’s assassin, John Wilkes Booth. The older Booth died in 1852, eight years before Lincoln was elected.There is also an 1874 invitation to the wedding of the daughter of President Ulysses Grant, a 1928 memo to the wife of the law partner of Lincoln’s son Robert Todd Lincoln and a 1948 limited edition copy of Stephen Vincent Benet’s poem John Brown’s Body.Selling such items would hardly make a dent in the debt. Online, a copy of Benet’s poem from the same printing goes for under $100. Several years ago, a New York dealer sold an 1851 Junius Booth playbill for $400.“You can’t take nine of those pieces and come up with $9m,” said Brian Kathenes, a New Jersey-based appraiser. “You’d probably have to go after some of the better stuff or sell a lot more of it off.”That will be difficult to do. Harold Holzer, an award-winning Lincoln scholar, said museums routinely sell duplicative items or “second-rate things” acquired along with prized treasures.“But not to pay the rent,” he said, “because the temptation is too large to defenestrate the place in order to pay for the walls. The walls were built to protect the material. The material is not there to protect the walls.“Everything that you remove exponentially cripples the institution. It makes things worse, not better. Even if you collect some money, your reputation is so scarred that I don’t think it would ever recover.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0cfc6511aa1b6757b9bdb1f80fa98e1c172720c/0_169_5047_3029/master/5047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f768931732e74d3d6b6549db15c58b","title":"extra 2m cars on uk roads for festive shopping and visits","story":"Saturday expected to be busy with traffic peaking again at lunchtime on Christmas EveDriving home for Christmas could best be done on Sunday, according to motoring organisations, with an additional 2.2m cars expected on the roads on Saturday for festive leisure trips, whether to shops or to visit relatives.The M40 northbound from Oxford into the West Midlands is most likely to land drivers in traffic on Saturday, according to the RAC and traffic analyst Inrix. Delays of more than an hour are forecast from junction 8A of the M40 to the M42 link road.Traffic generally would peak between 10.30am and 4pm, the RAC said, advising drivers to travel before 9.30am or after 7.30pm.After a relatively quiet Sunday, traffic is expected to peak again around lunchtime on Christmas Eve, when delays of around 20 minutes can be expected on parts of the M1 in the east Midlands.The worst of the Christmas getaway though has passed for motorists, on so-called Frantic Friday, when leisure travellers mixed with regular commuting traffic. An estimated 19 million drivers were out on Britain’s roads on Friday, according to the AA.Queues of slow-moving traffic were adding almost an hour to inter-city car journeys north out of London on Friday lunchtime, with the M40, M6 and M1 particularly busy, while journeys west on the M4 and A303 were also slowed by around 20 minutes.Rail services will be disrupted over Christmas for engineering works – as well as strikes in parts. Beyond the usual shutdown for 25 and 26 December, a number of key rail services will either be closed or reduced over the coming 10 days. Network Rail insisted that the majority of the railway would be unaffected, although it would be carrying out work worth £148m on 330 projects over the holiday season.Beleaguered passengers who have not been automatically provided with a rail replacement bus could turn to the coach, with National Express set to lay on an additional seats for 50,000 passengers over the holidays – including Christmas Day, when all other public transport options have been dashed. According to Trainline, most coach bookings for 25 December have been made for a lunchtime exodus from London to Liverpool.Among the most affected rail services will be lines out of London Paddington, with the west London station closed for an additional three days in late December. Half of London Victoria will be shut down from this Sunday until the start of 2019, as work closes one of the main lines into the station from Clapham Junction, Britain’s busiest rail interchange. The Gatwick Express fast airport service will not run for the duration.Stansted Express services will be reduced during work on the lines east from the capital to London’s third airport. East Midlands and Thameslink trains running north of St Pancras will also be affected by engineering.Christmas strikes by the RMT union, in the ongoing row about the future role and responsibilities of guards on trains, will disrupt Northern and South Western railway services. Northern services will come to an early end from around 5pm on Saturday and next Saturday, while the South Western network out of Waterloo will operate a reduced strike service on 27 December and New Year’s Eve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da5821dbfb34591f7e98ff277082e2edcb0bf42/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95574c41a2ee15cccc4f3d6e4b23c5fe","title":"thousands of hungarians join latest rally against orbans slave law","story":"One of labour reforms allows employers to ask staff to work up to 400 hours per year of overtimeThousands of Hungarians marched to the presidential palace late on Friday to protest against labour reforms as a rally led by spoof political party MKKP merged with a subsequent demonstration staged by opposition groups.Passage of two laws last week backed by prime minister Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party angered a variety of groups.One, dubbed by critics the “slave law”, allows employers to ask staff to work up to 400 hours per year of overtime. Another would set up new courts which critics say could be politically manipulated.MKKP’s gathering started outside parliament, where one protester brandished a placard saying “Happy boss, gloomy Sunday”.The Two-Tailed Dog party (MKKP), launched over a decade ago as a joke, has become a semi-serious force, using ironic humour to tackle practical issues. “I wanted to come because I consider the Dog party to be the most serious of all in the current lineup, which is rather sad,” said Almos Edes, 26, a university student holding a sign saying ‘We promise everything’ beneath a logo of Fidesz.Edes was sceptical of any change being triggered by the rallies, but said he had joined to make his voice heard.Friday’s rally also took aim at grievances including regulations that have led to the departure of the Central European University, founded by Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, from Budapest.“We can finally work eight days a week. We no longer need to hassle with independent courts. Homelessness has been eliminated. Irritating foreign schools will vanish. And Soros, Soros, Soros, Soros, Soros,” said an invitation to the rally posted on Facebook.Orban has said the protests have been partly stoked by activists paid by Soros, an accusation Soros’s Open Society Foundation has denied.Demonstrators, subsequently joined by another rally called by opposition groups, then marched up to the presidential palace in Buda Castle, briefly blocking a bridge crossing the Danube River."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43cddfce65bd65eee7f15aab906287369b511edb/927_3714_5265_3159/master/5265.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f039e25eb9f3060274866ca0494373e1","title":"what happened next weekend stories 2018 blind date","story":"Did the arts campaigners bring change – and did any Blind Date couples make it official? Following up the year’s Weekend storiesMeanwhile, Simon Hattenstone reported on cleaning up UK sport. In July, Goldie Sayers was finally awarded her bronze medal in the javelin from the 2008 Olympics, after Russian silver medallist Mariya Abakumova tested positive for drugs during a re-analysis of her sample.In February, we challenged four writers to give up plastic for a week. Stuart Heritage was getting through a mountain of nappies, and bought a SodaStream to try to reduce the number of plastic water bottles he used. His town now has a packaging-free shop, so his rice, pasta, spices and salt doesn’t even touch plastic. “Best of all,” he says, “one of our children poos in the toilet now: landfills of Britain, you are welcome.” Ian Jack, meanwhile, has now cut back on the takeaways and goes out for Chinese, Indian and Vietnamese: “Yes, we’ve cut back on the takeaways, and most of them these days are from a pizza place, that packs its pizzas in plain brown cardboard boxes that look very recyclable. If we want Indian, Chinese or Vietnamese food, we go out and eat it, though a favourite local Chinese takeaway, Zing Zing, now promises in its online manifesto that “most of our containers are recyclable and come from a supplier that uses socially responsible techniques during the manufacturing process.” Maybe more takeaways could adopt this practice. A lot of stuff in our refuse bins is still plastic, of course – bottles for shampoo, bathroom cleaner and so on – but I think less than before.Earlier that same month, Hattie Garlick reported on a scheme at Dartmoor prison, training inmates in mediation to encourage non-violent communication. Since then, the scheme has expanded – it now has 12 facilitators, six of whom are full time – and plans to expand to another wing next year. According to Maria Arpa, who is leading the project, staff have noticed that the Dialogue Road Map she introduced has increased safety on the wings for prisoners and staff.In April, John Harris wrote about families who have been separated by visa restrictions introduced by Theresa May during her time at the Home Office. The rules mean that if you meet someone abroad and want to live with them in the UK, you must be earning at least £18,600 a year the result is that around 15,000 children are thought to be living without one of their parents.Laura Clarke, who lives in Rugby with her son Elijah, is still fighting to be reunited with his father, Biniyam, who is stranded in Ethiopia. Under “exceptional circumstances” rules, she has once again applied for a visa for him, and spent thousands of pounds in the process. “Both Elijah and I have not seen Biniyam since early October 2017,” she says. “He’s missed another birthday and now he’ll miss another Christmas.”Tom Shelton went through a painful period in County Durham, while his wife Annie and her son were forced to remain in the Philippines. In October, he left the UK for six months to rejoin his family. “It’s great to be together again,” he says. “Wonderful and worrying at the same time. In the UK, Annie would earn more than £20k a year, but here she gets £7 a day: a good salary locally, but it just covers rent and food. There’s no ability to save.” Sally Williams’ report in May on women who carried the BRCA mutation, a gene that dramatically increases the risk of getting ovarian or breast cancer, encouraged more women to sign up for a study that Daniel Reisel, coordinator of the BRCA research clinic at University College London, had recently launched. Called BRCA Unite, supported by the gynaecological cancer charity the Eve Appeal, it is investigating what saves some women with the mutation and why.In May, Diane Taylor wrote about Jimmy Thoronka, a sprinter from Sierra Leone who three years ago was homeless and living in a park, after vanishing following the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Thoronka was finally granted discretionary leave to remain in the UK for two and a half years this April. He continues to train at the Mile End track in east London and is being coached by Lloyd Cowan and Clarence Callender. He is also working for Sainsbury’s, coaching children, and hopes to complete a course in personal training next year. He still lives with Taylor and her partner, Simon Hattenstone.Rupert Neate reported in May on the deaths of three young Britons while working for billionaires on multimillion-pound superyachts . Since then, at least two more crew members have died, including Rebecca Boyle, 32, a stewardess from London, who died on the Italian riviera this summer. A coroner found that Boyle died of injuries sustained when she fell on her way back to her cabin from the yacht’s hot tub. Meanwhile, the 40-strong crew of the Indian Empress – a $95m superyacht owned by former Formula One team owner Vijay Mallya – were awarded more than £700,000 in back pay, more than a year after Mallya abandoned the yacht and crew in Malta following his arrest on £1bn fraud charges.In July, Jonathan Watts and photographer Thom Pierce profiled seven environmental activists risking their lives to protect land around the world. In November, there was good news for Nonhle Mbuthuma: after a long and, at times, violent struggle against powerful mining interests, the Amadiba campaigner and her community won a landmark legal case in the South African high court. The judge ruled that the government must have permission from local people before it can offer mining concessions. Elsewhere, many activists continue to face enormous and often deadly dangers. On August 11, Weekend published a gal-dem magazine takeover, in which every byline, photograph and illustration was contributed by a woman or non-binary person of colour. That weekend saw an extra 7,000 copies of the newspaper sold an additional 500 copies of the magazine made available through the  Bookshop (a first) sold out in days. gal-dem editor and deputy editor Liv Little and Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff say the issue felt like “a defining moment in becoming a fully fledged business.It’s often the first thing people want to talk to us about”.In September, Sally Williams reported on the family of Nur Begum, who are among the million Rohingya refugees sheltering in the world’s largest refugee camp in Bangladesh. The family is now facing its second winter in the camp. The Bangladeshi government announced it would begin repatriations to Myanmar in November, but the transport buses remain empty. “There is likely to be a further push next year,” a spokesperson from Oxfam says. “It’s clear that it’s not safe for refugees to go back, and there’s little progress on granting them the equal rights that they want.”Nur has since become unwell. “She has a cough,” her daughter-in-law Zaheda says, “so she is staying close to the camp’s medical centre.” But there was good news for Rashida, 25, Nur’s youngest daughter, and a mother of four, who had been abandoned by her husband Jamir: he has since returned. “They are happy,” Zaheda says, “and I am feeling happy about that. I long to go home, but we are afraid of what could happen to us in Myanmar.”In September, writer Dina Nayeri went to Katsikas refugee camp in Greece with Refugee Support, to report on how the charity is trying to revolutionise the way camps distribute aid. Since their visit, Katsikas has doubled its capacity to 1,000 refugees after adjusting to the number of new arrivals, the mini-market that Refugee Support opened there is thriving. It launched a pilot Empowerment Fund in July, where it asked people in the camp for business ideas to promote self-sufficiency – it has so far funded 12 ideas, from bike hire to pie making.Joe Hammond wrote about his terminal diagnosis of motor neurone disease, and why he is writing cards and letters for his young sons to open on their birthdays after his death. He has now completed 26 of his planned 33 cards, typing the final seven after the weakness in his right hand made his handwriting illegible. “My body is failing fast, but life remains richer than it ever did before,” Hammond says. Since the article appeared, he has corresponded with a huge number of  readers who lost a parent as a child, while 4th Estate publishers bought world rights to the book. Hammond can now do very little for himself in January, he will have a feeding tube fitted.Also in September, Anna Moore told the story of Sally Challen, who is appealing her life sentence for murdering her husband on the grounds that she was a victim of coercive control throughout their marriage. Sally’s hearing has been postponed twice, and is now listed for February 2019, more than two years since Sally’s grounds for appeal were originally submitted. Sally’s son, David Challen, describes the wait as “excruciating”. Meanwhile, on 22 November, Justice for Women – the campaigning group behind Sally’s case – won leave to appeal for Emma-Jayne Magson, who is also serving a life sentence for killing her partner.In October, Jess Cartner-Morley reinvented her column to reflect the new eco-aware mood in fashion. She was, she admits, anxious about how the piece would be received. “I worried that the truly ethical would shoot my efforts down for not being rigorous enough, because I still buy and recommend new clothes, as well as championing ‘shopping’ from your existing wardrobe. Also that my front row crew would drop me, Mean Girls-style, for being photographed in clothes that cost £30 a decade ago.” But the reaction was overwhelmingly positive. “Some of my favourite responses were from fashionistas who confided that they were cutting down on new purchases, too.”Josh Jacobs revealed the abuse and misuse of MPs’ staffers in October. Since the article appeared, the House of Commons announced that Gemma White QC will launch an independent investigation into Westminster work culture. Jacobs has received calls and messages from yet more staffers and their families, telling stories of being demeaned by their bosses.In November, Sarah Boseley and David Levene reported on how the Democratic Republic of Congo is stamping out sleeping sickness. the same month, the European Medicines Agency approved fexinidazole, the first simple oral pill for the disease that used to kill thousands and for which, until a decade ago, the main treatment was drugs derived from arsenic. It will transform prospects for those infected by the bite of the tsetse fly and could help eradicate the disease by the WHO target date of 2020. It’s a triumph for the Congolese doctors and their government programme, and for the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative.And what of our Blind Date couples? We ran some numbers on this year’s columns and found that the average dater scored their evening an impressive 7.93 out of 10. There were kisses shared on eight dates and six people awarded their date a perfect 10.We asked all our daters what happened next of those who replied, at least four couples made it to a second meeting. MA student Sophie and solicitor Emily’s date in July has blossomed into a full-blown romance. “We had a second date before the article was even published and have been seeing each other ever since,” Emily says. Meanwhile, illustrator Lizzie and book editor Tom gave each other full marks in May 2017 – and announced their engagement in April this year. “We are so grateful as we would never have met otherwise,” Lizzie says. “We’re very, very happy.” They have invited Nina Trickey, Weekend’s cupid, to the wedding.While other dates didn’t lead to love, they did have life-changing consequences. Both Laura, a digital marketing manager, and Richard, an employment lawyer, used their moment in the spotlight to come out of the closet. “I had a hugely positive response,” Richard says. “It lifted a massive burden from my shoulders.

Photograph: Ray LohanThis award is claimed outright by a very special group of men and women who exist in a peculiar political limbo reserved for creatures known as Ministers of State.These poor souls yearn for full Cabinet status and live in constant hope that somebody in the Taoiseach’s first XIV will resign, get sacked or run over on Kildare Street by the 67 bus – sooner rather than later.A delegation of Ministers of State from outside the greater Dublin area met Minister of Finance Paschal Donohoe this month and pleaded with him for more expenses as the cost of accommodation in the capital these days is astronomical.Under existing rules, a Minister of State receives a €94,535 salary as a TD and a ministerial payment of up to €35,319, pushing their earning power up to €129,854. They do not enjoy the same expenses regime as backbench TDs, and this rankles.Unfortunately, news of their tête-à-tête leaked and all the juniors got for their trouble was an overwhelming wave of derision from inside and outside Leinster House. Paschal sent them away with a flea in their ear.This one goes to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar who, having survived a toe-curling meeting with a bored-looking Donald Trump in the Oval Office, set off for Capitol Hill for the traditional Speaker’s lunch and lost the run of himself during a speech in front of the president and members of Congress.Launching into an anecdote about a conversation he had when minister for tourism with then businessman Trump, Leo told how the man who would become president asked if he could do anything about the proposed building of wind farms near his newly purchased Doonbeg golf resort in Co Clare.He said he rang Clare County Council on his behalf.“I tried to do what I could do. The planning permission was declined . . . The president has very kindly given me credit for that. I have to say it probably would have been refused anyway,” he added, modestly.And a trip which should have been a success ended up with Leo insisting he did not try to influence the planning process while, back home, Opposition TDs bellowed for an inquiry.This award goes to Helen McEntee, Mairéad McGuinness and Verona Murphy who, on the Brexit front, have been playing a blinder in Europe, and more particularly, in the UK.McEntee, the Minister of State for Europe, has been growing in stature in Brussels as she bats for Ireland in negotiations and at media briefings. She is a very able stand-in for Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney when he can’t attend meetings. She has also handled media situations with bullish UK Brexiteers with understated authority.MEP McGuinness has been a rock of sense in a sea of confusion, misinformation and meat-headed ignorance, calmly stating the case for Ireland and the European Union as Brexiteering MPs and Anglocentric journalists wilfully try to misinterpret her plainly-put statements of truth. Her stock in Europe has never been so high.Wexford woman Murphy, head of the Irish Road Haulage Association, has become a much sought-after commentator about Brexit and its effects on business. Her impressive grasp of her brief and knowledge of the transport sector has left many Leave cheerleaders floundering. So it comes as no surprise to hear that the trucking expert, who puts the articulate into articulated, is currently being courted by the Fine Gael with a view to her running for the Dáil in the next election.Just one other thing. Is it absolutely necessary for Leo Varadkar to have Helen McEntee standing silently at his side during every photo-op in Brussels and at every impromptu doorstep interview? Is her seat in Meath so vulnerable that he has to do the Sinn Féin trick of pushing candidates into every TV shot and camera frame?This goes to Michael Lowry after his Long Walk to Freedom in June when he emerged from Dublin Circuit Criminal Court with a “fantastic result” after “22 years of turmoil”.The Independent TD for Tipperary and former minister for communications, who was excoriated by the Moriarty tribunal for his involvement when minister in the awarding of the State’s second mobile phone licence to Denis O’Brien’s Esat Digifone consortium, left court in “a free man” with nothing but four convictions for tax offences against himself and his refrigeration company along with an overall €25,000 fine and a trifling three-year disqualification from acting as a company director.The runner-up in this category is Shane Ross, who had a run in with his constant tormentor Mattie McGrath in the Dáil canteen after McGrath had been giving him a tough time over his proposed drink-driving law.Mattie was having lunch with his daughter when Ross, aka Winston Churchtown, came tearing around the corner, shouting the odds.“You’re a bollocks. You’re a f***ing bollocks,” Winston told a startled McGrath in the course of an expletive-laden tirade. Winston then disappeared around the corner, only to re-emerge and start the name calling again.But the winner is journalist and anti-abortion activist John Waters, who took the hump during a podcast with Eamon Dunphy and stormed out of the studio.“Aaah, don’t go!” pleaded Dunphy as his guest departed having been asked to define when life begins.“This isn’t a fair interview! You’re a bollocks! You’re a f***ing bollocks! You can f*** off, Eamon! . . . Talk to Una Mullally. F*** off.”This goes to Ivana Bacik for her tireless work, stretching back to her student days, on the abortion campaign. And for her great energy in promoting Votáil 100, the centenary of womens’ suffrage.The winner here is Daily Mail journalist Joanna Bell, who was ejected from the Irish embassy in London last week for her drunken heckling of Ambassador Adrian O’Neill during a reception. Bell, originally from Dundalk, interrupted him as he spoke about the possibility of a second Brexit referendum.Afterwards, she contritely revealed that “a good lunch with an eccentric aristocrat” was the reason for her “excessive robustness.”The eccentric aristocrat, by the way, is the Hon David Roper-Curzon, who is set to be Lord Teynham when his 90-year-old father dies.As she was being escorted down the stairs, Bell shouted: “This is because I am pro-Brexit.” Also on the stairs, but heading in the opposite direction, were Jeffrey and Mary Archer.Mrs Archer shouted after her: “I’m a Brexiteer and I’m not being asked to leave. This is about manners, not politics.”And then Jeffrey cried: “And I’m a Remainer!”No. Not the Pope. Francis delighted his many followers when he visited in September, but what was supposed to be the highlight of his trip – Mass in the Phoenix Park – was something of a damp squib due to rain and a low turnout.The award goes to Minister for Culture Josepha Madigan, who was the subject of one of the most unexpected political stories of the year when she was forced to go public and deny that she had celebrated Mass in her local parish church when the priest failed to turn up one Saturday evening.What actually happened is that she led a prayer service with fellow parishioners in the absence of a priest so that the congregation were able to worship, albeit in a different way, having made their way to church.And she got a rap on the knuckles from Diarmuid Martin, the Archbishop of Dublin, for her trouble.Committees are often overlooked, but certain TDs and senators put in a lot of hours and hard work at this unglamorous end of politics. The Public Accounts Committee is a different animal. It gets a lot of attention and, consequently, it is often used by grandstanding TDs to draw attention to themselves.Catherine Connolly, Independent TD for Galway, has been an outstanding performer at the PAC. She is calm, measured and incisive. She asks her questions and she gets her answers. Job done.If only others – yes, Marc MacSharry, we’re looking at you – could do the same.This one is being shared by Mattie McGrath, Michael Collins and the Healy-Rae brothers. Rarely a day goes by in the Dáil without one of the four kicking up a stink about how rural Ireland is on its last legs, dying on its feet with its people broken and beaten down by “them above in Dublin”. They paint a pitiful situation of life beyond the Pale. If you were to spend too long listening to their bellyaching, you’d begin to wonder why anyone at all wants to live in rural Ireland.There is good and bad in rural and urban living. This forever complaining quartet, despite what its members might believe, doesn’t have the monopoly on bad luck stories in the Dáil Éireann.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan is still marooned in the Seanad, months into the Upper House’s consideration of the Judicial Appointments Bill. Senators, particularly those with legal backgrounds, are holding up the progress of the Bill by tabling countless amendments and talking for Ireland.They are ably marshalled by senior counsel Michael McDowell, who is having a filibustering field day and enjoying every minute of it. He hasn’t looked so happy in years. What could make him happier? Word is that he would love a Dáil comeback.Meanwhile, Charlie must endure the meanderings with fortitude. It’s Winston Churchtown’s pet project, but he doesn’t have to listen to the senators droning on. Charlie has clocked up almost 70 hours of duty – it’s like he’s doing community service in the Seanad. The debate has reached section 38 of the Bill, and there are more than 60 to consider. And all the while the amendments fly in.Bród and Síoda.By popular acclaim, and a landslide victory, Michael D Higgins.This goes to Simon Harris for his achievement in leading a difficult abortion referendum campaign from the front, steering it to an overwhelming vote by the people to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution and overseeing the introduction of legislation to allow the provision of abortion services in Ireland. He was present in the Seanad on the night of December 13th, along with those who campaigned for decades for Irish women to have autonomy over their own bodies, when all stages of the Bill passed.The winners are Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney. Despite being rivals for the party leadership last year, the two have worked together very well on the Brexit issue. They have presented a united front and remained steadfastly on message. Their sure-footedness and grasp of the issues is in marked contrast to the Brexit shambles lurching between crisis and farce across the water.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin is the clear winner. From his surprising Dáil announcement in January that he was not only supporting the campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment but was also in favour of the introduction of abortion within a 12-week time limit, to his decision to continue supporting the Government next year so it can be free to concentrate on Brexit issues, Micheál has put in a strong and principled performance in the thankless and difficult role of leader of the Opposition. He is also saddled with a parliamentary party team which is far from united, with some actively working to undermine his leadership.It may be that he knows he doesn’t have the numbers to come out on top if an election is called in the next 12 months, so stalling in the “national interest” isn’t such a bad idea. And while his decision to support the recommendations of both the Citizens’ Assembly and the Oireachtas committee on abortion was deeply opposed and resented by a large rump in the party, he emerged as the one most in tune with the will of the people.The decision to continue the confidence-and-supply arrangement with Fine Gael may backfire on him, and is very unpopular with many activists, but the public may take a different view and reward him for taking a noble stand at a time when Ireland faces potential grave national crisis."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

People are looking to reduce their exposure and closing out high risk sell positions before the holidays and this is creating upward pressure on market prices, which is ultimately resulting in a rally.CoinMarketCap)The dramatic price gains come at the end of a disappointing year for Bitcoin, having traded at close to $20,000 (£15,850) in December 2017.The wildly fluctuating price is not unusual for the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency, with five previous cycles seeing bitcoin fall by an average of 85 per cent each time.Before the latest recovery, the price of bitcoin was around 83 per cent down on its 2017 high.iStock)Opinion is ided over whether bitcoin will return to its previous highs, with some analysts suggesting that bitcoin will eventually become worthless.\u0026nbspOthers are more positive in their forecasts, including Mr McAfee, who famously predicted that one bitcoin will be worth $500,000 (£396,000)\u0026nbspin 2020.If not, I will eat my d**k on national television, he tweeted in July 2017.

But is that reasonable?In 2017 Liam Fox famously claimed that concluding a trade deal with the European Union after Brexit would be the “easiest in human history” because we’d start from a position of already being fully aligned on tariffs and regulation.Such bullishness is notable by its absence now.Indeed, one of the reasons Brexiteers are so alarmed by the Irish “backstop” provision of the withdrawal agreement is that even they doubt that there will be a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU in place by January 2021\u0026nbspwhen the transition is supposed to end.But what are the prospects for trade deals between the UK and the rest of the world after Brexit? What deals could we strike with the likes of China, India, Brazil and other emerging markets?A glance at the international trade secretary’s Twitter feed\u0026nbspshows he remains upbeat on such prospects. Is this warranted?The answer is that it will depend\u0026nbspto a significant extent on what sort of trade deal the UK can get with the EU.Brexit is a mess, so why are MPs not postponing their Christmas break?Other countries are very likely to wait until they see how close we end up to the EU’s single market and the customs union before deciding, as that will impact the cost-benefit calculation of any bilateral UK trade deal for their firms and industries.If we end up closely aligned on customs with the EU that might limit our government’s autonomy to even forge independent trade deals on goods with third countries since we could be imposing the EU’s common external tariff.What about services? Well, presuming we’re out of the single market, that would give us more scope for services trade deals. And it’s true that services are a large and growing share of UK total exports.Yet the problem here is that international trade deals in recent years have been essentially about goods, rather than services.Another snag, at least from the perspective of sovereignty-obsessed Brexiteers, is that a service deal worth having would entail some degree of regulatory harmonisation, for instance recognising each others’ professional qualifications. Is that “taking back control”?Associated to that question is immigration. “A big ask of emerging markets when it comes to trade deals is UK visas for their nationals,” says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform.That may not go down well with those Brexiteers who want less immigration from developing countries, not more.Finally, there’s “gravity” to think about. It’s an empirical reality that countries tend to do more trade with big economies that are closer to them than those that are further away.Even if we did successfully forge goods and services trade deals with lots of emerging market economies the results might well be disappointing to Brexiteers, like Fox, who have assumed big increases in trade flows.It’s for this reason that almost all Brexit modelling exercises, including the government’s\u0026nbspone, show only a modest gain to UK GDP in the long term from hypothetical post-Brexit trade deals with the rest of the world, with the damage far outweighed by the macroeconomic costs of introducing trade frictions between us and the EU.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But how could it look under a no-deal Brexit?Items that are grown in the UK won’t be affected, but those that are imported will become more costly as they will be subject to tariffs and other expensive trade barriers.Parsnips and carrots Let’s start with the good news. Parsnips and carrots are grown in abundance in the UK. They are available throughout most of the year and are rarely imported from abroad. So even a Brexit as hard as a raw parsnip is unlikely to affect this popular Christmas side dish.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPeople with the Brussels sprouts-hating TAS2R38 gene are out of luck. Brussels sprouts are so abundant in the UK that they are actually exported around the world. The topical Christmas cracker joke, “How will Christmas dinner be different after Brexit? No Brussels” is unlikely to be true for the actual vegetable.These are the least recyclable Christmas chocolate wrappersAlthough the UK is a major potato producer, some potatoes and potato products still get imported to meet UK demand. This mainly applies to frozen or processed potato products such as frozen fries. Due to a large harvest in 2016-17, the UK is expected to be a net exporter of fresh potatoes in 2017-18. Fresh potato imports have been predominantly from EU countries, but traditional suppliers such as France appear to have found other markets. UK fresh potato exports are predominantly to the EU (98 per cent).So as long as growing conditions are favourable, there ought to be sufficient fresh UK potatoes to roast for Christmases to come.It is thought that sweet chestnut trees were brought to Britain by the conquering Romans and, like many other immigrants, they have naturalised and become an important part of the food chain. In most years\u0026nbspthe nuts grow to a reasonable size in the south-east of England. But in other areas it is unusual for more than one of the fruits in each husk to reach full size. They are generally not harvested in time for Christmas, but can be preserved by boiling and freezing.The fresh chestnuts you see at Christmas in the UK are mostly sourced from elsewhere in Europe. This is because sweet chestnut trees in the UK are threatened by both fungal blight and, more recently, the oriental chestnut gall wasp.If having reasonably priced quality fresh sweet chestnut imports is important to you at Christmas, Brexit could be a problem.Created with Sketch.

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place.

They also make a good option for retaliatory tariffs against the US, the world’s largest cranberry producer. The EU took more than 50 per cent\u0026nbspof US cranberry exports in 2018, with the UK leading the way.That is not to say the UK does not have its own cranberries. The two native cranberry species in the UK are vaccinium oxycoccos (the northern cranberry) and vaccinium microcarpus (the small\u0026nbspcranberry). Wild harvesting used to take place in Scotland but, due to habitat loss, this is no longer done. As a consequence, the cranberries bought in UK stores are the species vaccinium macrocarpon. These are harvested in North America and Eastern Europe using a method that involves flooding the land, which is impractical in the UK.Vaccinium macrocarpon is also grown commercially on Terschelling, an island belonging to the Netherlands. The Netherlands is also a global trade centre for fresh fruit and vegetable imports and exported about €6m (£5.4m) worth of cranberries in 2017 (many of which were grown elsewhere).So the availability of cranberries in the UK is largely dependent on shipments from the EU. This supply chain arrangement may have to change after Brexit, particularly if the UK were to decide not to follow EU trade legislation. Depending on the flavour of Brexit, the costs of establishing a new supply chain independent of EU trade hubs and losing the economies of scale that the EU enjoys as a whole could lead to shortages initially and increased costs in the future.The majority of UK families opt for roast turkey on Christmas day. This will cost them more if there’s a hard Brexit.Turkeys are becoming more expensive to produce in the UK. Turkey producer Kelly Bronze’s prices, for example, are up by about 5.4 per cent\u0026nbspthis year and it has warned that a hard Brexit will affect its business by 70 per cent.A significant cost of producing turkeys in the UK is related to the labour cost of hand plucking. This relies on EU migrant labour and staffing for the Christmas peak and is a real concern. Brexit scenarios considered by farmers’ groups indicate that any deal affecting\u0026nbspthe labour pool is likely to lead to increased prices.For those not paying a premium for hand-plucked turkeys, any Brexit trade deals imposing tariffs or import restrictions on cheaper turkeys from the EU would not make them cheaper for the consumer. A trade deal with the US might provide the option of turkey meat marinated in chlorine – not necessarily to everyone’s taste.Strasbourg attack: Is it safe to visit Christmas markets in Europe?Elderly woman cuts down flashing Christmas lights in middle of nightCassetteboy remixes Die Hard to prove it’s a Christmas filmThe average number of turkeys slaughtered in the UK per week in December 2017 was half a million birds or about 2 million over the month. Allowing for the additional 1.6 million from November, the figure is still more than 6 million short of the estimated 10 million consumed at Christmas.Pigs in blankets The cost and availability of sausages wrapped in bacon is dependent on pork supplies. British farmers currently produce only 40 per cent\u0026nbspof the pork eaten in the UK. The other 60 per cent\u0026nbspcomes from EU countries such as Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.So, as with turkey, a hard Brexit would lead to a rise in the cost of sausages and bacon due to either import costs or supply and demand issues.Christmas might only come once a year but Brexit is likely to make it even more expensive.Hana Trollman is a PhD researcher at Loughborough University.

He was holding a print-out of the draft of an article I’d written. “You did law, didn’t you,” he stated. It was true, my degree was in law. I nodded.\u0026nbsp“What’s this?” He asked, pointing to his desk. “It’s a desk,” I said. “Well f*****g well say so. Don’t say, ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs, and therefore might be a desk.’ It’s a desk.”I can’t tell you how often I’m reminded of Bambridge’s words. There is hardly a day that goes by when I don’t see a piece of writing or hear a speech that is pure verbiage, and can only have been produced by a lawyer or a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe latest example is particularly shocking. When I last looked, BT was supposed to be a communications company. Okay, telecommunications. But a corporation, nevertheless, that ought to pride itself on directness and speed of delivery. In that context, the ability of the receiver to comprehend should be paramount.\u0026nbspUnited Airlines mocked for corporate speak response to passenger rowSo, take this, from BT as it promises to overhaul its pay policies after the investor backlash following the £2.3m package handed to departing boss Gavin Patterson. The company will consider “a broader range of performance factors and wider circumstances” when determining executive remuneration. It also pointed to “a more structured process to help it step through the application of its discretion in the future.”Eh? Who writes this stuff? Clearly, not someone who believes in telling it how it is, and is unable to say something for definite without suffocating it in qualification. That has to be a lawyer, or as I say, a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe problem with this approach is that it suggests an organisation that is hidebound, stricken with fear, unable to proceed without a high degree of caution, incapable of saying “we screwed up, and we’re sorry”. Patterson received too much –\u0026nbspperhaps not under the strict terms of his contract –\u0026nbspbut, given the company’s poor showing, too much.\u0026nbspDecisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out.But BT cannot admit that, oh no. It won’t try to claw back the money as that would be unseemly, and besides, the lawyers have probably advised that would be difficult. Instead, it attempts to sooth and gloss over with words straight out of the lawyers’ lexicon of “safe” twaddle.\u0026nbspSlight as it is, in the overall picture of a multi-billion pound global empire, BT’s announcement about leaders’ pay is indicative of a loss of way, a lack of confidence. Intuition has succumbed to process.\u0026nbspWith any management there should be room for both, for the heart and the head. Of course, things have to be done properly and carefully, but they also need to be done. Decisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out. It is not the answer.Too often, I’ve seen the lawyers rule the roost. On a product safety issue, where fatalities had ensued, they were reluctant to let the management meet the relatives and express their condolences, because this could lead to an admission of liability. In another episode, involving a food company, they took the same line. Again, after a tragedy, a holiday operator was told on no account to contact the family.\u0026nbspWhile lawyers may give their advice for the best of intentions, to avoid the client being shredded in the law courts, and having to pay out vast sums, they do not afford enough attention to that other court, the one of public opinion –\u0026nbspand the one that these days, especially with instant relaying of news, 24-hour bulletins and social media, is increasingly vital.\u0026nbspThere’s little point in shoring up a legal defence, in cloaking a company’s actions in legal procedure and its outpourings in law-speak, if it simply makes the company the subject of derision, and harms its reputation.\u0026nbspSurely\u0026nbspit’s not beyond the wit of any intelligent C-suite member to say they share the loved ones’ pain, without stating there and then, it was the company’s fault? Likewise, is it really impossible for BT to say it recognises, and is concerned about investors’ frustrations, and will do its utmost to prevent a recurrence?Ask any business chief what keeps them awake at night, and they will say loss of reputation –\u0026nbspto the business, and to them, personally.

A redesign sets out to show that to consumersClick to followThe IndependentWorkers at Suma in Elland, YorkshireWhen Sheree Hatton started working at the whole foods distributor Suma six years ago, she knew it was different to anywhere else she’d ever worked.Hatton lives in Halifax with her husband and young son. In her previous job in advertising and sales for a newspaper, she was\u0026nbspused to a hierarchical business with targets for workers. Suma,\u0026nbspa worker’s co-op where each employee owns a share of the business, offered her a chance to have a say in everything from overall strategy to day-to-day operations.\u0026nbspEating organic food lowers risk of certain cancers, study suggestsCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Organic food healthier than farmed products, says new research“I knew Suma was different from what I had been used to,” Hatton says. “But the more I learned about co-ops, the more I realised that by feeding into business decisions\u0026nbspyou have an equal opportunity to say how the business should be run.”Suma is known as the largest whole food distributor in the UK. But fewer people know that Suma is also Britain’s biggest workers co-operative, with an annual turnover of £55m. More than 200 people now work at Suma after rapid growth in the last few years.\u0026nbspAll of them are considered equal. Every worker at Suma is paid the same salary of £33,000. They get the opportunity to work in every part of the business – including the canteen kitchen – on rotation at the company offices in Elland, Yorkshire. And they get to vote on business decisions. “We are an equal business and we’re very proud of what we’re doing here,” Hatton says.\u0026nbspBut customers, like Hatton, often aren’t instantly aware of Suma’s co-operative status or what that means, according to a survey they commissioned in 2017. “One of the embarrassing points was that not everyone knew that we are a co-op,” Hatton says. So in 2017, Suma workers decided it was time for a rebrand.\u0026nbspPearlfisher (Courtesy Photo)Suma was started over 40 years ago in the kitchen of a house in Leeds. Reg Taylor, owner of a small retail shop, proposed at a meeting attended by other wholefood shops in the north of England that they set up a wholesaling co-operative, to supply to each other, in 1975.The name Suma was first used when the business moved to a lock-up garage in Leeds. In 1977, the business was sold to seven employees who became the founder members of the Triangle Wholefoods Collective Ltd, trading as Suma.Suma has recently benefited as consumers have become more conscious of their health and the ethics of food, plus the growing popularity of veganism. The business introduced its own vegan line in September 2017. New vegan products, including the 2018 introductions of meat-free mini-burgers in tins, have helped sales grow in the last decade.Suma now sells over 7,000 products. The branding has evolved\u0026nbsphaphazardly as lines have been added. Workers knew from customer feedback that they needed a redesign to create a single identity across all ranges, including essential, body and home. Designers also wanted to position Suma at the forefront of the new movement for sustainability and contemporary food.“We really wanted to show off that it was a co-op,” says Harriet Ferguson, senior designer at Pearlfisher, the agency commissioned to do the work. “The existing identity didn’t really do that.” Pearlfisher designers added a tagline to the logo\u0026nbsp“Co-op since 1977” to make Suma distinctive against competition against younger brands. Then they designed a logo out of different shapes to show the different personalities in the co-op.“We called this our Suma of parts and used these shapes to create the logo type. This\u0026nbspdynamic pattern can be used on the packaging at\u0026nbspdifferent levels,” Ferguson says.Suma’s inhouse design team picked some of the trickiest products for Pearlfisher to work on in the redesign, including fiddly products with small labels, like pate tubes, and some that didn’t obviously fit into one range, like coconut products.Pearlfisher turned their designs into a set of packs for Suma’s inhouse designers to roll out across old and new lines. The agency also introduced colour palettes to make different products more identifiable. They used earthy tones for the basic products, simple colours for unprocessed food and bright, natural colours for processed pastas and peanut butter. For the premium products, like speciality coffee, they used a charcoal colour palette with pops of colour.The most important thing, says David Jenkinson, creative designer at Pearlfisher, was creating a sense of the collective in all the elements. “The new identity embodies the idea that this is a collective of iniduals,” he says. “They are aligned, they sing from the same hymn sheet, but they are different.”The new\u0026nbspcolourful logo, with its tessellating shapes, will be seen on lorries up and down the country and on tins and tubes of Suma products in wholefood stockists\u0026nbspfrom January.\u0026nbspWhole Foods releases its 2019 list of new food trendsA key part of Hatton’s job has been communicating the new design to staff internally. In a company where 200 people can vote on every small change, Suma needed a process to make sure the redesign wasn’t delayed by disagreements. “We didn’t want 200 people deciding what colours to use!” says Hatton. Instead the branding team built a case for the rebrand and wrote a business plan. They took the plan to workers, who voted it through. Then the designers were free to make decisions, with in-house work making sure workers were happy with the results.“It’s probably been a little slower, just generally because we’re trying to get consensus and make sure people are behind everything before we proceed,” Hatton says. Some longstanding members wanted to stick with the existing designs, because they saw that it had worked. Hatton and other Suma members listened to them and tried to alleviate any concerns. “In a typical commercial industry people just get told what is happening,” she says. “The difference is that we want people to be passionate about it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged.

Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

Quentin Crisp, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Brigitte Bardot, Edward Snowden and Brendan Cox have all given past speeches.Dyer provided one of the TV highlights of the year\u0026nbspin June when he appeared on ITV’s Good Evening Britain -\u0026nbspas part of a surreal panel also including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and ex-Baywatch star Pamela Anderson – and launched into an impassioned rant against Brexit and former prime minister David Cameron.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Who knows about Brexit? No one has got a fucking clue what Brexit is, yeah.

He’s in Europe, in Nice, with his trotters up, yeah? Where is the geezer?\u0026nbspI think he should be held to account for it.\u0026nbspTwat.”In November, Dyer continued his diatribe against the British political class and the “age of food banks”\u0026nbspin The Big Issue.“Theresa May, bless her, just got that job by default,” he told the magazine. “Boris Johnson running around with his stupid haircut, spouting bollocks. Young people look and think: ‘If these are the people running the country, why shouldn’t I just go and loot and riot?’”“Politicians are just floundering around. They have been given this thing called fucking Brexit because of one man. One man. Who we voted in to be our prime minister, who purely for his own ego decided to call a referendum just to get rid of Nigel Farage.“Well, fuck you\u0026nbspCameron, you posh twat. Sorry. It backfired on him, didn’t it? And what does he do? He fucks off. He doesn’t like the way it went and he fucks off.”The Londoner’s plainspeaking on TV and on Twitter has made him a folk hero over the years and his vitriol on Brexit\u0026nbspsaw him become an immediate fixture in Cold War Steve’s satirical photomontages on Twitter, as high an honour as 2018 had to offer.Dyer – who first rose to fame starring in low-budget Cockney gangster films and as host of Danny Dyer’s Deadliest Men -\u0026nbspwill also address American politics in his Christmas Day broadcast, describing Donald Trump as an “absolute melt”. He previously asked his Twitter followers:\u0026nbsp“Is it me or is this geezer completely off his strange-looking nut?”One of his most famous tweets of all concerned events across the pond in 2012:\u0026nbsp“Can’t believe it’s nearly 11 years since them slags smashed into the Twin Towers. It still freaks my nut\u0026nbspout to this day.”As for the Queen, his rival for viewing figures on 25 December, Dyer is actually distantly related to her, as we learnt from a memorable 2016 instalment of the BBC’s Who Do You Think You Are?, which traced his East End roots back to the Tudor epoch and Edward III, a revelation he was stunned by.“I think I’m going to treat myself to a ruff… Just get a massive ruff, just bowl about with it and if anyone questions it then I’ll explain to them why I’m wearing a ruff,” he said, rather touchingly.\u0026nbspWishing the Queen a happy 90th birthday on an episode of ITV’s Celebrity Juice, he said: “You probably ain’t got a clue who I am… Go out tonight and get off your fucking nut. Enjoy yourself!”The author of The World According to Danny Dyer (2015) has done some of his very best work on social media, routinely dishing out deathless wisdom in his signature style: “I hate that early bird. You know, the one who catches the worm. Get back in ya nest ya feathery little mug.”On Christmas, he posted in 2013:\u0026nbsp“Just whacked me tree up. It’s looking slightly camp this year.\u0026nbspCan’t work out how to give it a pair of bollocks.”On pubs:\u0026nbsp”You’re going in for a drink and a laugh with your mates.

Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu.

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place. He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle.

Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.Griffin was sacked by CNN in March 2017 after posing in a photo while holding a fake bloody head that resembled that of Donald Trump.The comedian, who apologised and said she went too far with the image, went back on tour in 2018, performing at New York City\u0027s Carnegie Hall among other venues.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And thus did Charles Dickens become the man who invented Christmas as we know it today.\u0026nbspThe great Dickens scholar FG\u0026nbspKitton said so in an essay in 1903, and the great Downton Abbey actor Dan Stevens proved it to be true by starring in the 2017 film The Man Who Invented Christmas.Charles Dickens: The man who invented Christmas plagiarised JesusAnd yet, bah, humbug and damn those pesky experts: lots of them disagree.\u0026nbspIndeed, no less an authority than the US university-based Dickens Project now advises: “It is the smart thing to say that Dickens was the man who “invented” Christmas. Show you are smarter by disputing it.” A Christmas Carol\u0026nbspcomplete with John Leech\u0027s illustration of Mr Fezziwig\u0027s ball\u0026nbspIt is true that industrialisation meant fewer people were exposed to the rural squirearchy’s habit of opening their doors to the lower orders and staging grand Christmas celebrations – of the kind seen at Crewe Hall in Cheshire, where Dickens’ grandfather had been the butler, or in the pages of A Christmas Carol, where The Ghost of Christmas Past reminds Scrooge of how much he had enjoyed the dances organised by old Fezziwig.But in 1843, outside the ranks of the aristocracy and aspirant upper middle-class imitators, Christmas was alive and well.\u0026nbspPrevious attempts to kill it had, after all, foundered on the stubborn resistance of “Merrie England”.Puritan MPs may have ordered December 25 to be kept as a fast day in 1644, to avoid giving “liberty to carnal and sensual delights”.\u0026nbspAnd Oliver Cromwell may be famous as the man who banned Christmas.\u0026nbspBut the “rude multitude” broke the head of the major who tried to enforce the “Ordinance for abolishing holy-days” in Canterbury in 1647, and by 1656 MPs meeting in parliament, on Christmas Day, were reduced to wailing: “The people keep up these superstitious observances to your face … We are returning to Popery.”Created with Sketch.15 Christmas films to watch on Netflix  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Christmas Chronicles, a holiday adventure from producer Chris Columbus (“Home Alone”, Harry Potter) and director Clay Kaytis (The Angry Birds Movie), tells the story of sister and brother, Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis), whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about.

After A Christmas Carol, people become obsessed with celebrating Christmas.“Before, there were people who were, like Scrooge’s nephew, doing their own family Christmases, but after, suddenly everyone is thinking: ‘We should be doing that.\u0026nbspWhy haven’t we got people coming round and playing blind man’s buff?’“It all starts to get much bigger.”Newspapers began to notice the establishment of “plum pudding clubs” to help less well-heeled Victorians meet the cost of their Christmas dinner, so they too, like the Cratchit family, could hear “the pudding singing in the copper”.\u0026nbspOther clubs helped them buy a goose, maybe even a “prize turkey” as big as the boy asked to fetch it by the reformed Scrooge.And, says Ms Hawksley, fewer employers wanted to look like the unreformed Scrooge: “It became fashionable for people to expect that they could have time off at Christmas.”Nor did Dickens stop at A Christmas Carol.\u0026nbspHe wrote four more Christmas books.\u0026nbspThen in 1850 he brought out the first “Christmas Number” of his newly created magazine Household Words, working with other writers to pack it with stories for the consumption of “the teeming millions”, as Reverend JH\u0026nbspMorgan called the intended readership of the two-penny weekly.He became, as the Morning Chronicle put it, “the chief literary master of the ceremonies for Christmas”.But, Ms Hawksley\u0026nbspemphasises, when he started it all with A Christmas Carol, Dickens had been seeking to do far more than simply become a sidekick to Father Christmas.\u0026nbsp“It was done as a protest,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “Christmas Carol was written from the heart, from Dickens feeling a desperate need to create change.”These were the “hungry Forties”, a decade when Britain was in the grip of economic depression, when harvests failed and food prices were rising beyond the reach of many on low incomes.\u0026nbspIn May 1843 Dickens had railed against the wealthy attendees of a City of London charity dinner, calling them “sleek, slobbering, bow-paunched, overfed, apoplectic, snorting cattle”.\u0026nbspThey offered a stark contrast to the poverty he was encountering with ever greater frequency on his customary long walks through London.Then in October Dickens was invited to give a fundraising speech at the Athenaeum in Manchester.\u0026nbspThis was the same Manchester where Friedrich Engels was beavering away at what would be published as The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844.\u0026nbspEngels sought to shame the Victorian manufacturing class by documenting the “the misery and grime which form the complement of their wealth”.\u0026nbspHe told of workers living in overcrowded slums complete with “foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement”, forced by “barbarous” employers to “work 30 to 40 hours at a stretch”, with child factory hands dying or being reduced to “a crowd of cripples” before they could reach adulthood.\u0026nbspHe wrote A Christmas Carol in just six weeks.\u0026nbsp“He saw galloping poverty,” explains Ms Hawksley, “And a government doing nothing about it.\u0026nbspHe couldn’t let it continue.\u0026nbspHe was desperate to do something.”Into the mouth of Scrooge, Dickens inserted what, in his Manchester speech, he had called the “cruel absurdities” of the age.\u0026nbspTo the charitable gentleman seeking alms for the poor, Scrooge offers only a reference to the treadmill of the workhouse, which was about the only official social security option then available.When the gentleman suggests the poor would rather die than enter the workhouse, Scrooge answers: “If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”The remark comes to haunt Scrooge once the ghosts start arriving, but it wasn’t far off what many thought about the poor being an unconscionable drain on the finite resources of a population that could not keep expanding forever.\u0026nbspIn most of his books, Dickens wanted to shame his readers into doing something,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “What he wants people to realise is that every single person is, like Scrooge, responsible for the poor they are ignoring.“The point about Scrooge’s conversion is not that he buys the most expensive turkey.\u0026nbspIt’s that the turkey will feed a family.“For Dickens, it’s not about diamonds, or going out and buying a load of plastic crap like people do at Christmas today.\u0026nbspIt’s about the fact that buying decent food and giving Bob Cratchit a salary increase will save Tiny Tim from dying.”Nowhere, says Ms Hawksley, is the central message of A Christmas Carol more clearly stated than when the Ghost of Christmas Present shows Scrooge two emaciated children, a boy named Ignorance and a girl called Want.\u0026nbsp“Beware of them both,” the spirit tells Scrooge –\u0026nbspand the reader.\u0026nbsp “But most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.”“Dickens was saying,” explains Ms Hawksley, “that if you let Ignorance and Want grow up like that, they will become the Bill Sykes, the cruel and violent adults, of the future.“Ignorance and Want are, in Dickens’ mind, about the most important characters in the book, the whole message, the whole point of it.”What frustrates her more, however, is that 175 years after Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol, Britain remains blighted by the kind of poverty he was hoping to eradicate.“Dickens was writing about this in 1843,” she says.\u0026nbsp“How in 2018 can we have the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty talking about child poverty in the UK?\u0026nbspHow can there be so many homeless people on the streets of London?“How can I be hearing news stories that Christmas 2018 will be a so-called “bumper year” for the numbers of children suffering in cold houses because people can’t afford to heat their homes?\u0026nbspThere is absolutely no excuse for it when today we have so much more in terms of money, housing and knowledge of sanitation.”How London is living a modern day Christmas CarolWhat does Christmas Carol still mean to us?In the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, after “crying his eyes out” over A Christmas Carol, the author Robert Louis Stevenson, wrote enviously: “Oh, what a jolly thing it is for a man to have written books like these and just filled people’s hearts with pity.”In the 21st century, Dickens\u0027 great-great-great granddaughter is grimly ambivalent about how the work continues to generate similar reactions.\u0026nbsp“Every year,” says Ms Hawksley, “I meet people who have read A Christmas Carol for the first time, who say, ‘I can’t believe how good it is, how it still resonates.’“That’s wonderful in terms of Dickens’ writing, but depressing in terms of society.\u0026nbspIt frustrates me that A Christmas Carol is still so deeply relevant.\u0026nbspIt bothers me that 175 years after Dickens was writing about the children Ignorance and Want, we still have so much child poverty.”“And that,” she says, “Is what would make Dickens spin in his grave.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your

The Infinity-O screen has already been used on the Samsung Galaxy A8, meaning the other three could be used in the three expected variants of the Galaxy S10.Previous rumours suggest the three iterations will be called the Galaxy S10 Lite, the Galaxy S10\u0026nbspand the Galaxy S10+.The three versions are expected to vary in size and price, ranging from £699 for the cheapest and smallest 128GB S10\u0026nbspLite\u0026nbspversion, to £1,399 for the biggest and most expensive 1TB S10+ version.S10 (Creative Commons, mobil-helden)Other rumours surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S10\u0026nbspsuggest it may feature a self-healing screen, which makes use of a protective material to help prevent scratches.A Samsung patent for the screen describes an anti-fingerprinting composition having a self-healing property, and a film, a laminate, and a device including the anti-fingerprinting composition, for use in a portable electronic device such as a smart phone or tablet.The Galaxy S10\u0026nbspwill be unveiled at a Samsung event ahead of the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona, according to sources at a major tech retailer cited by the Gizmodo\u0026nbspwebsite.\u0026nbspSamsung has not revealed the exact date of the release, but the smartphone is expected to be released on 8 March 2019.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/27/17/rts1a6jk.jpg","title":"slack ban accounts us sanctions cuba iran","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

First, there isn’t going to be a New Year election and, even Mr Corbyn was in charge, Brussels would still demand the same ‘backstop’ to protect the Irish border in the orce agreement.Either his understanding of the Brexit impasse doesn’t extend beyond key stage one level or he is guilty of the same charge he levels at Theresa May – of running down the clock, rather than making hard choices.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal BrexitLabour’s Brexit policy, such as it is, is set out in the “composite motion” agreed after many hours of agonised bargaining by more than 200 people at the party’s conference in September.It vows to defeat the prime minister’s deal and then “support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote” should Labour not be able to secure a general election.All clear? No, of course not – because, in the three months since, Mr Corbyn has never set out what the other “options” might be, beyond his support for a permanent customs union.Most political observers believe there are three crashing out of the EU with no deal, softer ‘Norway-style’ exit terms (but with the backstop) and a Final Say referendum.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Yes.”He also urged Mr Corbyn “to return to the chamber” to hear his verdict on what happened later this afternoon, after watching the TV footage.Corbyn\u0027s barely there leadership could lead to mutiny – againLabour \u0027would fall behind Lib Dems\u0027 if Corbyn backs May\u0027s Brexit dealJeremy Corbyn accuses May of presiding over \u0027government in chaos\u0027In a BBC TV studio, Barry Gardiner, a Labour frontbencher and Corbyn ally, said he was “not a lipreader” but agreed it appeared that Mr Corbyn had said “stupid woman”.The row blew up after Ms May likened Mr Corbyn’s attempt to force a confidence vote in her earlier this week to a Christmas pantomime – accusing him of dithering.First he said he would call a no confidence vote, Then he said he wouldn’t. Then he did, but it was not effective. “Oh yes he will, oh no he won’t,” she taunted – saying the Labour leader should “look behind him” at his own despairing MPs.But Mr Corbyn hit back, saying it was the prime minister’s job to deliver the negotiation and, if she was incapable of doing so, she should step aside for someone who can.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereVote of no confidenceOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And some reality TV stars set a good example, just as some of our more traditional public figures leave a lot to be desired.It seemed to me that Love Island winners Jack and Dani were quite a moral couple. They acted with integrity, which is a really good message for young people.But contrast this with US President Donald Trump — I’ve spoken to girls in an assembly about lewd com-ments he has made and how they fit with his role of Leader of the Free World.More recently, we’ve seen Harry Redknapp triumph in I’m A Celebrity — and he came across as a loving, loyal man who represents an image of masculinity that sometimes we don’t see.So never mind politicians,you want to present an argument for decency, sometimes you’re better off getting a healthy dose of reality TV.THE incoming head of the Girls’ Schools Association, Sue Hincks, says reality TV stars are better role models for schoolchildren than politicians.Is she right  As evidence she offered ’s Love Island and I’m A Celebrity.It’s true that this year’s winners — Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham in Love Island, and Harry Redknapp in I’m A Celeb — were adorable.But it’s easy to look brave when you are wearing a helmet full of insects, especiallyyour background is in musical theatre, like campmate John Barrowman.I’d try to remember I was comparing reality TV stars to Donald Trump, who, though incidentally President of the United States and a politician, is still, and always will be, a reality TV star. He just has more cameras these days.But then I look at the current state of British politicians and it’s hard not to agree with Hincks.At least on reality TV the contestants try to disguise their moral failings, becausethey didn’t, no one would vote for them.This isn’t a problem for politicians, because on any given day the other side are behaving worse.I long for the calm wisdom of ’Arry and the open-hearted kindness of Dani — I’m sure she would be fine, with a strong Cabinet secretary behind her, telling her the dference between the deficit and the debt. Perhaps the new crop of “wholesome” reality TV stars is a response to our politicians, a cry of the heart from the electorate: “We just want someone kind!”Look at Boris Johnson, and his new haircut for the leadership contest that never came. What did he tell his barber  “Don’t make me look like a flatulent, floppy-haired former public schoolboy” When did anyone last call BJ kind Or at David Davis, who pitched for the Tory leadership in  with the catchphrase “It’s DD for me”. That’s not a campaign slogan, it’s a bra cup size.Look at the younger Tories, seething with ambition, bungee jumping over the corpses of rivals with lattes in their hands.The horrible irony is, they would bite their own fingers off for a chance to appear on Strictly Come Dancing.On the other side we have a Labour leadership juddering with cowardice, longing for a hard Brexit — while lying about it — and a swt General Election, like the bourgeois Trots they are. If it’s bad for the people, it’s good for them. Yuk.So Hincks isn’t wrong to make a comparison which even five years ago would have seemed obscene.Can it be that reality TV stars are the best of us, and reality TV is now more authentic than actual real le If true — and it seems to be — things are bad indeed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Such a move, he added, would help those most at risk from a No Deal Brexit “to boost them as they transition”.We’re told in a doomsday No Deal ­scenario that all planes will be grounded and the country will be sold no medicines from abroad.It’s even claimed that our food exports will rot in lorries queued up at Dover, while we starve because no food is being imported via Calais, both of which seem unlikely to happen at the same time.To listen to some campaigners, you’d think there are only three kinds of ­relationship with the EU: Membership, paying the massive bills and swallowing endless laws from Brussels a big, one-size-fits-all deal or a smouldering ruin, cut off completely from trade or co-operation.It might be in their interests to pretend so, because they want to try to frighten us into accepting a poor deal or scare us into abandoning the idea of taking back control altogether. But it isn’t true.Most of the world aren’t EU members, after all, and many countries don’t have trade deals with the EU.Brussels’ rule-by-committee means that trade negotiations with the bloc are slow and have to satisfy a dizzying list of ­special interests.Of the deals that countries have struck with the EU,  dferent types have been hammered out.Anyone who claims there is no flexibility in how we manage our relationship after Brexit is not telling the whole story.But even beyond that, among the many countries who trade with the EU without a deal, the reality does not match up to the black-and-white claim that the choice is either full deal or No Deal.In real le, most countries are quite practical and have the power to reach a whole range of smaller agreements with one another that fall short of a trade deal but still bring benefits.They recognise each other’s driving licences or doctors’ qualications, allow mutual access to their air space, or agree to trust each other’s safety tests on goods rather than hold them up for costly extra testing at their ports.Why do they do it  Because it is in both sides’ interests for trade, tourism and le in general to flow as easily as possible.The US does it, the EU does it, every normal state does it — and there’s no ­reason why we and the EU couldn’t do it, too,it isn’t possible to reach a larger agreement for le after Brexit right now.As Theresa May is finding out, some issues might simply be too dficult or controversial for the UK or the EU to give ground on in the next few weeks.But that should not stop us from ­shaking hands on hundreds of other side deals that both sides could agree quite simply, and which would help both sides to square away.That’s what’s called a “managed no deal” — it might not be either our or their dream outcome but it would make le easier while work continues on overcoming the really dficult sticking points.What’s shocking is the way in which this practical approach has been widely ignored for political reasons.Some of the much-touted “worst-case scenario” forecasts for the supposed cost of Brexit rely on the ridiculous assumption that Brussels and Westminster would do literally nothing to reduce any potential problems from No Deal.We’ve been told repeatedly from some quarters that it is simply impossible for the EU to show any flexibility at all with a non-member, even though it has done so in ious cases.At long last, that lie is being exposed. Just as the UK has released its No Deal preparations, the EU is this week ­publishing details of how it would ­handle that situation.And guess what  Brussels wants to strike mutual side deals in which we both agree to respect ious aspects of each other’s rights in order to limit ­disruption and costs.It turns out there is a practical way ­forward after all, and the doom-mongers’ predictions should be taken with a hefty fistful of salt.Of course a good, wide-ranging, lasting deal is still desirable, and we should keep working to agree one.But there are things we can and should do in the meantime.Better that than be rushed into a ­permanent bad deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would seem they agree about nothing. As soon as one minister says something another clown will jump up and insist he’s wrong.It’s like being led by a bunch of hyperactive five-year-olds. If it wasn’t for the fact that the leader of the opposition is a cross between Catweazel and Trotsky we’d have got rid of them long ago.This time the argument is about immigration. The Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has said there are no targets for reducing immigration. The PM immediately responded: “Oh yes there are, baldie.”For once, Theresa May is right. Immigration is a crucial issue and we have been promised time and again — by May herself — that it will be drastically reduced. That’s what the vast majority of the country wants. And the only sensible way to do it is by having targets. You know, something to aim at.We’ve put up with a lot from this Government, maybe too much. If they start backsliding on immigration, that will be it. Down to tens of thousands of people per year, please, as soon as possible. Uncontrolled immigration has made this country almost unrecognisable.We still need to import some talent from overseas. People with good skills and high qualications. What we don’t need are thousands of beggars shoving badly scrawled messages in your face saying “Money Give Now” on the Tube.Nor do we need the thousand upon thousand of unskilled workers picking fruit and veg. Here’s a tip, farmers — pay a decent wage and maybe a few British people will give those jobs a go, huh British businesses have exploited cheap foreign labour for far too long. And the result is an underclass of Eastern Europeans living in desperately squalid conditions, in appalling accommodation.It’s not THEIR fault, by any means. It’s the fault of an immoral system which has seen the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.Cheap EU labour has meant that the wages of the very poorest Britons get undercut. Why on earth the Labour Party supports this exploitation is a total mystery to me.But the other real problem we have is immigration from outside the EU. This easily outnumbers those coming from Europe. I don’t just mean those who say they are refugees but are clearly economic migrants. Although Theresa May could do worse than pledge a halt to that influx, which continues.But we still let in thousands of people from all over the world. They come claiming their brother or cousin lives here and that should give them a right to our benefits and jobs.This has been going on for too long. And it is this immigration which has most changed the face of Britain, in a way many people resent.Here’s the deal, Theresa. Look at Belgium, where the government has just fallen because it ignored the country’s wishes on immigration. So get tough. Put Mr Javid back in his box and set a few realistic targets. Then get to grips with immigration full stop. And maybe we’ll all like you a bit more for it.SOME lesbians are furious.On Coronation Street, the lesbian character Kate Connor tried to seduce . . . a bloke.And the scene got a lot of lesbians up and down the country seething with rage.

Compared with the old welfare system, people are more likely to find work, stay in work, and earn more money.However, there ARE problems - as The Sun’s powerful Make Universal Credit Work campaign has brilliantly highlighted. Families have shared their stories of waiting weeks for their first payment, of children losing their nursery places because of delays in childcare payments and of the high taper rate meaning it’s not worth their while to work longer hours.The Government must listen to the Suns campaign. I particularly support the call to keep reducing the taper rate – the effective tax on benefits as you go into work. Our original design of the system was for a rate of  percent. The Government has already brought it down from  percent to  percent and it should go further.Likewise, the call for childcare support is welcome and mirrors ideas from the Centre for Social Justice.Childcare can be complex and expensive to navigate – anything that makes it more affordable and simpler is welcome.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. For the aim of Universal Credit is to simply six dferent benefits into one single claim. It lets them keep more of the money they earn. And, crucially, it gives claimants a single work coach to guide them through the process.When fully rolled out, best estimates are that Universal Credit will help between , and , more people into work, those already in work to earn more, and those in part-time work will to move to full-time.And with two-thirds of people coming onto Universal Credit bringing signicant debt with them, it shows the deeply ingrained problems of what went before.It’s also worth reminding ourselves that when Tax Credits rolled out, nearly  million people never got their benefits.But there have been some problems with the implementation of Universal Credit.Firstly, cuts to the system in  have made transition onto it harder and drove my own resignation in part. I have, alongside organisations, such as the Centre for Social Justice, have since campaigned to see those cuts reversed.It is to the current Government’s great credit that they have re-invested about £ billion of the £ billion taken out, but it can go further. Investing in Universal Credit should be a priority.A system that supports work is itself a health policy with huge benefits.The educational outcomes for a child in a working household increase - girls who grow up in jobless households spend an average of two years less in school than those whose parents work, and boys spend one year less. If we want to tackle the current mental health problems in the UK, work has a vital role to play.Secondly, the design of the new system is meant to help people get work ready. Fundamentally Universal Credit is not just a tool for financial support but for changing lives.It does this in part by using online applications, helping people take responsibility for their own rent, and receiving their income in monthly arrears like a pay cheque.But for some people, particularly those with dficult and chaotic lives, this change, though important and right, has been hard to navigate.Some payment flexibility has now been added but it’s time to invest in Universal Support [programmes that help people making a claim for Universal Credit and give them online money support - such as budgeting advice].This support package was designed to run alongside Universal Credit and help support those in the greatest need but has been all too thinly rolled out.For the most vulnerable in society, this aspect is crucial, and must become a priority. As should the areas for change that The Sun is highlighting in its campaign.The Sun is right, a full-time job is still the single best way out of poverty, which is why making Universal Credit work should be our priority because as Joseph Rowntree said, properly rolled out, UC has the greatest capacity to tackle poverty."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457506946.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britains prosperity brexit small businesses","story":"But it is Britain’s businesses that will get us out of it.Whatever happens in our negotiations with the EU, this country will depend for its prosperity after Brexit — as it always has — on millions of businesses, up and down the land selling, exporting and innovating.It is these firms that have made us a great trading nation, and the fth largest economy in the world.But there is a problem.The “voice of business” heard in Whitehall is not the voice of business.It tends to be the voice of the Confederation of British Industry , which is dominated by the comfortable incumbents and large multi-nationals.Family firms — those owned and run by one person, or by members of the same family — make up the overwhelming majority of Britain’s businesses.These .million firms employ .million people, or almost  per cent of workers — and pay enough tax to fund the entire NHS.They are at the heart of our communities, rooted in their lives. Yet all too often, their needs are ignored.My own family started as blacksmiths in Uttoxeter, Staffs.In , my father, Joseph Cyril Bamford, rented a lock-up garage for  shillings a week.He developed Europe’s first hydraulic tipping trailer for use by local farmers — and then, in , the backhoe loader, the classic JCB digger.JCB — JC Bamford Excavators Ltd — has produced more than a million machines.We have a turnover of more than £billion and factories around the world.Yet we remain a proud ­family business, headquartered in the Midlands and employing thousands of people there.Ours is not a unique success story. Yet it is rarer than it should be.Our main factory in Staffs used to be surrounded by thriving family manufacturers, mostly in the Black Country, Birmingham and Manchester.Over the decades, they have disappeared — because of tax regimes that made it impossible to pass firms on, or takeovers that stripped away what was special about the company, or government mandarins who thought they knew better what industry needed.In Germany, their world-class manufacturing sector thrives because they champion family firms, not least via tax breaks that make it normal for ownership to move across generations.In Britain, the tax system pushes entrepreneurs to sell up, and family businesses find it harder to get finance.No wonder that fewer than  per cent expect to keep their firm in the family.Yet we at JCB still have many excellent family firms among our suppliers — and our customers.In manufacturing, there are more than a quarter of a million family companies, employing more than a million people in jobs that add real value to the community.And such firms are found in every sector of the economy, not just ours.A company such as JCB is big enough to stand up for, and speak for, itself.But too many small firms do not get a hearing in government.Despite the fact that small and medium-sized enterprises — SMEs — are creating almost three times as many jobs as larger firms, it is the voice of the giants that dominates.Yes, these large firms contribute enormously to the economy, but they tend to be the most comfortable with the status quo.They might moan about regulation but they can afford to deal with it, knowing that it deters their smaller competitors.They see Brexit, for example, in terms of costs, rather than opportunities. This is reflected in government.Theresa May’s approach to Brexit was safety-first, focusing on protecting the cross-border supply chains of the multi-nationals.Yet  per cent of British firms do not export. Their main worries are to do with competition and regulation.But regulation, in particular, is harder to addresswe are still following European rules — as is striking new trade deals.Protecting the big companies means reducing opportunities for little ones.I voted, proudly and publicly, for Leave.I believe there is nothing to fear in trading on World Trade Organisation terms, as we at JCB already do — exporting to, and importing from, dozens of countries around the world.But this is not about Brexit. Millions of business owners throughout the country feel they are not represented or spoken for.Polling by Deltapoll recently found that even Tory voters do not think their party is on the side of small business.For the politicians who listen to these firms, the rewards will be political as well as economic.I have spent my le working in a family business.I believe family businesses, of all sizes, are tied to and invested in their communities in a way other firms can never be.And I worry that Britain has a model of tax, regulation and politics in which everything is arranged to suit the big firms on the FTSE, not those that might one day hope to replace them.Whatever the outcome of the Brexit wrangling, we can only succeed long termwe make Britain the best place in the world to start, run and keep a business of your own.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

above all  is a sign that the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party are prepared to back her Brexit deal.“Without the DUP, they haven’t got a chance of passing it,” warns one Cabinet minister.What, then, do the DUP need to come on board One Secretary of State who has kept open lines of communication with them, tells me that “by grim necessity, they will need something more than cosmetic concessions to vote for the deal”.This minister explains that “the DUP want a bankable reassurance that the backstop won’t be permanent and that there won’t be progressive ergence between Great Britain and Northern Ireland”.The good news for Theresa May is that, according to one of those intimately involved in the negotiations, “the DUP want to sort things out”.“Relations between the leadership and the DUP had been in the deep freeze, they are somewhat better,” one Cabinet minister tells me.Adding that “the carelessness with which some of the principals have been treated has been repaired”.But the bad news for Theresa May is that the changes they want are signicant — and the EU aren’t going to offer them up straight away.The only way to get these changes might be to have Parliament vote for them and tell the EU that this is how the deal can get through and seethey are prepared to cooperate, or whether they’ll crash the entire Brexit negotiation over these additions.But one senior Cabinet minister laments that “Number  is miles away from being in that position”.This Secretary of State is adamant that they are “going to have to move”.Intriguingly, I am told the Irish have, via diplomatic back channels, communicated that one of the reasons they wouldn’t give May what she wanted at last week’s European Council was that they weren’t certain that what she was asking for would satisfy the DUP.I understand that privately senior Irish figures have been making clear thatthey knew precisely what the DUP wanted, they could then engage with that.I am told the Government will devote the dog days between Christmas and New Year to exploring what the DUP will accept, and what the EU can give.Getting the DUP back on board is vital for May because without that there is no chance of reducing the Tory rebellion down to a manageable size.The Tory machine is having a bit of success in whittling down the numbers against May’s deal.One hardcore Brexiteer admits that some backbench rebels “will go a bit soft”.But this sht is not yet anywhere near big enough to save May’s deal.Some in Cabinet are pinning their hopes on “people coming back after Christmas more pragmatic and less militant”.But one of those who has been trying to reduce the rebellion wearily remarks, “I don’t see much evidence of that.”The person who in Parliament, perhaps, knows the Tory Party best tells me that the equation is this: “If they get a legally binding codicil on the backstop, they’ll get it through.If they don’t, they won’t.”Over to you, Mrs May.A TORY MP is already telling colleagues that he has submitted his letter calling for a no-confidence vote in Theresa May next December.It is another reminder that the leadership issue isn’t going to go away.One loyalist Cabinet minister argues thatMay makes it through Brexit, she should then announce the timetable for her departure at conference next year.Having said when she’s off would probably be enough to prevent a confidence vote next December and allow her to leave with some dignity.May, though, is unlikely to bite on this idea.She is extremely resistant to boxing herself in on a departure date.The confidence vote has won May some time.But she won’t make next Decembershe interprets the result as a licence to carry on as before.One senior party figure is already complaining that she’s “not prepared to make the personnel changes that would help her own position”.While one figure inside the Government machine fumes that “the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing in Number  and that is causing havoc for the rest of us”.Meanwhile, ambitious Cabinet ministers are continuing to lay the ground for their leadership bids.But as one Secretary of State points out, “It is normally the manner and nature of the departure that determines the successor” which is one of the reasons why the coming Tory leadership race will be the most unpredictable contest in living memory.THE Tory rage at Jeremy Corbyn over his alleged “stupid woman” comment at Prime Minister’s Questions was fuelled by a sense that the Speaker John Bercow is biased against them.As Anna Soubry, who is normally infuriating her fellow Tories by calling for a second referendum, pointed out: If it had been a Tory man who had apparently said it about a Labour woman, Bercow would have been all over it.In recent months, senior Labour figures have openly admitted that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to the allegations of bullying against Bercow because they think he’ll help them on Brexit.This is an untenable position – it is like a team keeping a referee on the pitch because they think he’ll give them a penalty in injury time.As Wednesday showed, we are dangerously close to the Tory side of the chamber simply not accepting Bercow’s authority.One senior Tory backbencher, who has defended the Speaker in the past, tells me “it felt like an insurrection”.The tragedy of Bercow’s speakership is that once gone, the chair’s reputation for impartiality will be almost impossible to restore.MPs will never again trust in the neutrality of the Speaker as they once did.THERESA MAY is planning a New Year charm offensive as she tries to persuade Tory MPs to back her Brexit deal.All of them – and their spouses – have been invited to a party in Downing Street in the week of January , which is when the Commons debate on her deal resumes.The implicit message is clear: If the Government falls over Brexit and the Tories tear themselves apart over the issue, then there won’t be any more invites to Number  for you and your partner for a very long time.Whether this is enough to win round any wavering Tory MPs remains to be seen.It is going to take more than a few drinks to make the hardcore Brexiteers swallow their objections to the backstop.EvenTheresa May can win the big vote on her Brexit deal, she won’t be home and dry.Once the vote is won, the withdrawal agreement will have to be turned into law.This will provide plenty of opportunities for guerrilla warfare in Parliament.Cabinet ministers are particularly worried that rebels might put down an amendment making the payment of the £billion orce bill conditional on progress in the trade talks.If that passed, the EU would say that the UK hasn’t ratied the agreement and so there was no deal.Our journalists strive

We have minds of our own, and we need to take responsibility for our own actions.The reappearance of naked prejudice on the terraces can’t be blamed on anyone other than the racists themselves — and the other fans who stay silent instead of calling out the racists.These people should be named and shamed. Social media could be put to good use by posting a rogues’ gallery on every  and the faces of the bigots should be prominent, so that their wives, mothers and children can see what they’ve done. Roll on #stampoutracism.But the mystery is why there is an upsurge in such incidents right now.I, for one, thought that with the determined efforts of the clubs, led by the Kick It Out campaign, such scenes would cease. But I should have known better. Back in the early Seventies I lived ten minutes from Stamford Bridge — but I never went to home games.When it became fashionable to throw darts at our own fans, a black face standing in the Shed was nothing less than a walking bullseye.By the mid-Nineties I hoped it would be OK to bring my seven-year-old daughter and her pals to a game.Surely, there could be no danger in seats below the directors’ boxes, away from the common herd It took  minutes for me to learn the truth as two men in front of us leapt up to abuse the Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Carlton Palmer, screaming “You lanky-legged black ****”.I tapped one on the shoulder. He looked around, saw my face, and immediately apologised profusely. But the damage was done.Three weeks later, I attended a dinner at the City of London’s most glittering venue, the Guildhall.Suddenly, I found myself confronted by a familiar face — one of the same two men who had sat in the stand in front of us.A true racist, yet here he was, suave, suited and booted, at the heart of the British establishment. So much for the idea that all racists are ignorant, lower-class idiots.So what’s happened It seems bizarre that the Premier League, dominated by foreign players, many of them black, should still suffer from prejudice.And with top teams regularly playing in Europe, plus a successful England team nearly half of whose members are black or mixed race it’s hard to see why fans should start throwing bananas on the pitch again.But the truth is that many of the factors that drove racism on the terraces have never gone away, and have never been challenged effectively. Yes, recent political arguments about the EU and about immigration have allowed some of the scumbags who the game thought it had chased away to resurface with renewed bravado.It’s also possible that the increase in the number of fans from Eastern Europe, where attitudes to ersity are decidedly less tolerant, may have had an effect.Perhaps some of the brilliant players from Europe who now grace the English game might put themselves in the front line of their re-education.Butthe game wants to stamp out racism for good it needs to take a long, hard look at itself.In the Premier League, around one in five players are black.The number of black owners and coaches is negligible. This is sending out the worst message imaginable.I welcome the advent of great players like N’Golo Kante, Romelu Lukaku, and Dele Alli. But this is a sport owned and run almost exclusively by white men, who buy and sell black men at will.Yes, of  course, the heaviest weight that the players have to lt is their own multimillion-pound pay packets, so I don’t seek sympathy for them.But basically, football looks like the th-century plantation economy of the American South.It’s time for the game to start taking steps to make sure that its owners, their boards of directors and their executive and coaching staff look more like modern Britain.Arsenal v BurnleyAFC Bournemouth v BrightonCha v Leicester CityHuddersfield Town v SouthamptonManchester City v Crystal PalaceNewcastle United v FulhamWest Ham United v WatfordCardf City v Manchester UnitedIf the people at the top of the game seem to think that it’s OK to treat black people like field slaves, why would they expect the fans to treat the players with respect I saw my first game — Arsenal vs Leicester City — at the old Highbury ground.My dad wanted me to see his hero, the great inside-left George Eastham, in action.He realised that I was too small to see over the parapet, so we took the biggest book we had in the house for me to stand on. I watched Eastham while standing on Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the bestselling anti-slavery novel that had touched off the American Civil War.Maybe every owner needs to be sent a copy of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s book to remind our contemporary plantation bosses that it’s time for them too to confront the bigotry written into the game’s soul.Football’s racism hasn’t gone away, and it never will until we all look at its evil full in the face.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Northern Irish MPs won’t accept the plan as it stands because it would put checks on some goods travelling between Britain and Northern Ireland.Sun columnist James Forsyth today reveals that the Downing Street party is designed to send a clear message to Tory MPs that failure to deliver a Brexit deal could see them booted out of power and that means “there won’t be any more invites to Number  for you and your partner for a very long time”.It came as the Justice Secretary said Mrs May is unlikely to pursue a no deal Brexither deal fails.David Gauke sparked fresh Tory infighting by saying he would be “very surprisedthe Prime Minister went down that route”.He also reiterated his threat to quitno deal became the Government’s number one Brexit policy – saying he would find it “very dficult” to stay in the Cabinet.And he exposed the extent of Cabinet infighting by saying there were “genuinely dferent approaches” within Mrs May’s top team over what Plan B should bethe Commons votes down her Brexit deal next month.He becomes the third Cabinet minister in as many days to publicly speculate on alternative plans to Mrs May’s Brexit deal.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said a second referendum would be “plausible” while Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom became the second Cabinet minister to publicly back a “managed no deal”the Withdrawal Agreement isn’t backed by MPs.Mrs May has always insisted that no deal is “better than a bad deal”.Mr Gauke told BBC Radio ’s Political Thinking podcast: “I think making a conscious decision to proceed with no deal would not be the responsible course of action.”Askedhe could stay in Cabinetno deal became the policy the Government pursued, the Justice Secretary said: “I think it would be very dficult for me in those circumstances.

The former Tory chancellor and Theresa May critic also attacked the Prime Ministers handling of Brexit negotiations. Mr Osborne, who was sacked from Cabinet by Mrs May in , accused her of following a Brexit means Brexit ideology because she backed Remain at the  referendum, albeit sotto voce. Therefore, she had to prove her Brexit credentials, said the former politician, who is now editor of the Evening Standard.  He added: That was essentially a massive mistake by the Conservative administration, which it was punished for at the general election because the Conservative Party decided to embrace the Brexit result in such a way as to essentially dismiss the views of those who voted Remain, treat them as saboteurs or traitors, and run against urban Britain. Mr Osborne, who said he had warned then PM David Cameron against holding the referendum in the first place, also attacked the reckless decision of hard Brexiteers to pursue a no-deal Brexit. He said: I dont think the country voted to mobilise the Army, stockpile medicine, hoard food and go around the world buying every fridge available. That is not what was offered and that is now what is happening. Mr Osborne was interviewed by David Dimbleby, who was guest-editing BBC Radio s Today programme on Saturday.  Mrs Mays Withdrawal Agreement is due to be voted on by MPs in January. But few expect it to be approved by a heavily ided Commons, and Tory MPs including Cabinet ministers appear to have begun to polarise between those who might support a no-deal Brexit and those who would actively battle against it. Justice Minister David Gauke said on Friday he would find it very dficult to remain in Mrs Mays Governmentthe UK appeared on course to crash out of the European Union without a deal, while several pro-EU backbenchers have threatened to quit the party. Mr Osborne, who resigned as MP for Tatton after being ousted by Mrs May, told Today thathe had remained in politics he would now be having to go along with a whole load of things which I profoundly disagree with, citing no-deal preparations like readying troops. He said: Of course I think perhaps I should have stayed and I could have been part of this melee in the Conservative Party at the moment. I would have essentially tried to steer a the country away from the rocks to which it is heading at the moment, and b the Conservative Party away from a prolonged period of opposition, which is where I think it is heading unless it engages more with modern Britain.  He praised MPs attempting to stymie a no-deal Brexit, saying the British political system is trying to pull the country back from this clf edge of the referendum result. He added: My view is a general election is at the moment an under-reported likelihood for  because in the British system the simplest way to solve political impasses has been toto the public and a general election. However he suggested Tory MPs could avoid that extreme measure by supporting a second referendum. Mr Osbornes interview came after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would continue with Brexitit won a snap general election in the new year. The opposition leader told thehe would go back and negotiate and see what the timetable would be with BrusselsMrs May triggered a vote and lost, thrusting his party into power. Mr Corbyn told the paper he would advocate Brexitthere was a second referendum on the issue, saying: It would be a matter for the party to decide what the policy would be but my proposal at this moment is that we go forward, trying to get a customs union with the EU in which we would be able to be proper trading partners. Mr Corbyn also attacked Brussels over its rules on state aid and competition. He told the : I think the state aid rules do need to be looked at again because quite clearly,you want to regenerate an economy, as we would want to do in government, then I dont want to be told by somebody  that we cant use state aid in order to be able to develop industry in this country.

Aged  and living locally, in a soft Scottish accent she quietly expressed regret le had been made harsher than in her salad days so she wanted to help families less fortunate than her own. Manager John McCorry, who manages the venue Church of the Venerable Bede in the Tyneside city’s Benwell area. thanked the pensioner and coaxed out her address to send a formal letter of appreciation. The cheque, I noticed, was for pound. She asked me not to publish her name as she was doing only what was right and deserved no public recognition. “I was able to get a decent council house and a decent job and now I’ve got a decent pension,” she explained, “and I’ve wanted to come in here for weeks. It’s wrong what’s happening to people. They should be helped not hurt. Creating poverty is unforgivable.”   Earlier a pair of handsome brothers in trendy trainers and designer clothes, strolled into the foodbank sited in the Church of the Venerable Bede in the Tyneside city’s Benwell area. Builders Behzad and Behnam Emami,  and , began to sweep up. Four yeas ago they had been asylum seekers from Iran who started volunteering when banned from paid employment. They continued after the Home Office let them stay and find jobs. “When we are free we are coming just to help,” said bashful Behzad. “To help people is good.” Later in the city’s historic indoor Grainger Market, with its famous Marks  Spencer’s Penny Bazaar, an old man in shabby clothes also wanted to help. I could see a handful of coins as he meekly approached a unit the Foodbank operates with Newcastle United fans to collect “Toonaid” donations from a Geordie nation doing what a Conservative Government isn’t.“The generosity of people is astounding, absolutely heartwarming,” said Mr McCorry.The foodbank he heads is distributing le-saving parcels from two centres, including the Church of the Venerable Bede.A warehouse in Newburn co-ordinates distribution.  “Without our wonderful volunteers and all the people collecting and donating food and money I shudder to think what might happen to the people in real need, going hungry. “It’s not just adults. It’s the kids too. And demand is growing. Poverty is rising. We see it, we know it.” The Newcastle West End Foodbank is part of the Trussell Trust network and the largest in the country, assisting close to , families this year with  tonnes of food worth pound,. Hot meals are served and parcels are provided to take home. Meanwhile an integration programme tries to sort out problems with landlords, benefits, health, both physical and mental, plus treatments for addictions. The gut-wrenching accounts of families left despairing by gaping holes ripped in the welfare state by the Tories are familiar everywhere in the country. Slum landlords, DWP sanctions, bad bosses and Universal Credit are curses either tolerated or inflicted by smug Conservative Ministers. People sleeping on streets or in cars and vans is increasing. One mother was pound, in debt after the council charged her pound a week bedroom tax despite her willingness to move into a smaller property the local authority couldn’t find. On my visit to the Newcastle West End Foodbank two dishevelled young men, former soldiers now living rough, told their stories. One explained to a volunteer he was close to giving up, feeling abandoned by the country which put him in unorm then dumped him. “If you’re out there and going about your le and you’ve got a job it’s not always obvious people are struggling,” said Mr McCorry. “But it’s growing at such an extent that the number unaware what’s going on is shrinking.”  Christine Wood, a retired library worker proud of her MBE, plays herself in I, Daniel Blake’s Foodbank scenes. The volunteer says: “We see good people treated terribly. Sometimes you’ve got to bite your lip when they tell you what’s happening, how they’ve no money and are really desperate. “You could cry but you can’t afford to cry, let yourself go downhill. You couldn’t help themyou did. “So you show empathy, try to put a smile on their faces. “We know who is creating this misery, what the Government’s doing, and they’ll never be forgiven.” "},{"url":null,"title":"christmas can tricky deaf children","story":"NewsWhy Christmas can be tricky for deaf children - and what you can do to helpTwo families explain what Christmas is like for a deaf child - and how to make festivities more inclusiveShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsFreya, eight, is profoundly deaf \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailChristmas a very exciting time of year for children, as they love the magic of Santa, the decorations and celebrating with family and friends.But amid the chaos and noisiness of festivities, it can be a tricky time for deaf children who may find it dficult to participate in all the activities - and feel like theyre missing out on the fun.Lynn Chipperfield, , lives in Manchester with daughter Freya, eight, who is profoundly deaf and has been fitted with cochlear implants. She says for Freya, pretty much every element of Christmas is affected by hearing loss, whether its films without subtitles at the cinema, visiting Santa or increased background noise at events.  We find the sheer volume of activities cause so much fatigue. Each event is harder at Christmas due to increased noise levels, concentration required and amount of people asking her questions, Lynn tells the Mirror.A hearing child can absorb the conversation evenits not directed at them by overhearing, but Freya will ask what has just been said. Evenit wasnt a conversation directed at her its important to repeat it as she has the right to be included. It doesnt matter is a banned phrase in our house - it always does! Lots of us take for granted how easy it is to follow conversations with family and friends, so willingness and patience to repeat phrases for deaf children is crucial. Lynn says some of their favourite activities at Christmas time are dressing up the dogs and watching their favourite festive film The Polar Express - and they can connect it directly to Freyas implants.Although aspects of Christmas are challenge for Freya, she still says she loves it.The eight-year-old tells the Mirror: I wish Christmas would be more quieter so I could hear everything but Christmas is very fun and I have been extremely good this year. Lynn adds: Im proud to be her mum and without being deaf she wouldnt be Freya - she paints a picture when she tells you a story to make sure you understand in the way she sees it and seeing the world though her eyes has given me a new perspective. Parents with deaf children have unique experiences at Christmas time. Stuart Milligan, , and Ros Fowler, , from Stewarton, say that Christmas seems to pass their three-year-old daughter Lois by. At this time of year nurseries are singing songs and telling stories about Santa and doing activities that make Christmas magical for children. Though Lois joins in at nursery, she doesnt understand what it is all about and it can get confused at what is going on around her, Stuart explains. Lois has always loved the sparkly lights so Christmas is great for that but the magic of Santa, of Frosty the Snowman, why you get presents, the trees and decorations and parties, the songs and jingles – its all a mystery for her. The dad says his favourite Christmas memory is from last year, when Lois had her implants switched on for the very first time in mid December after a long battle to get them. Words cant really describe the expression on her face when she discovered our voices, music and the noises of everything around her for the first time.  Stuart says that he felt anxious and uncertain as a parent when deafness was new to the family, as he didnt know what the future would hold for Lois and how her le would be impacted.The family have been proud to see her progress well at nursery and love swimming, gymnastics and dancing - and Stuart believes she can achieve anything she wants to.But he says he wishes people had the patience to make sure deaf children are included at this time of year, when everyone is rushing around to get things sorted. Taking the time to slow down and give a little time to make sure a deaf child understands and feels included is better than any present. The more people that know how to make small changes to their behaviour when with a deaf person, the easier it will be for deaf people to participate, he adds.Lucy Read, Head of Participation at the National Deaf Children’s Society, says there are lots of things people can do to make sure the deaf children in their families, friendship groups and school environments feel included.If everyone works together and picks up some deaf awareness skills, every deaf child can feel part of the celebrations and have the time of their lives this Christmas, she says.The National Deaf Childrens Society has five tips for making sure deaf children are included this Christmas:Deaf children rely on all kinds of signals and clues to communicate, eventhey wear hearing technology. Remember to face them when you’re talking to them, and don’t your hand over your mouth and or talk when you’re eating. If a deaf child misses a joke, or hasnt fully understood a conversation, never say “it doesnt matter.” This can be very upsetting for any deaf person. If it matters enough to share it, share it with them too. A Christmas film is a great way to spend time together, but ensure that the subtitles are available and are set-up and ready to go. No one wants to be an afterthought, or worse still miss out while everyone  enjoys themselves together. Background noise makes things dficult for deaf children.

Laura Aitchinson and her partner Lewis Killip welcomed son Carlos to the family on January   and then a second son, Nicholas, on Christmas Day . Incredibly, the mum, , gave birth a third time last week - only days before Christmas - to a baby girl, Lola Grace. Laura, from Cumbria, said: Ive always loved Christmas but Ive no idea how I manage to keep on giving birth over the festive season. It certainly wasnt planned!  Lewis, , and Laura met online six years ago and decided to start trying for a baby. Laura sadly suffered two miscarriages, one of which was baby twins. She says: When I fell pregnant a third time, we were both understandably very anxious, in case it happened again. But the pregnancy went well, with the baby due on January  . Instead, little Carlos made an appearance five days early – on New Year’s Day. Laura said: I went into labour on New Year’s Eve and we could hear all the fireworks going off outside. It was very special. Carlos was born on New Years Day at am, weighing lbs ozs and he was perfect.  The couple settled down to parenthood and it was only in September that Laura noticed she was gaining weight and also had developed cravings. She said: I did a pregnancy test and we were stunned when I was pregnant again. Even more so – I was almost six months gone and the baby was due on New Years Day! I just couldnt believe it. My body hadnt settled down after having Carlos, so I just thought the extra weight and the irregular periods were a result of giving birth. I hadnt for a minute thought I might be pregnant again.”  Laura went into labour at pm on Christmas Eve and Nicholas was born at am on Christmas Day. She said: We couldnt believe it – a New Years day baby and a Christmas Day baby - both in the same year! I was allowed home later that day, with Nicholas, and I was even well enough to cook Christmas dinner. Laura fell pregnant again earlier this year – and her baby daughter was born last week. She said: I really don’t know how we keep having babies at Christmas, but its lovely. Christmas is all about the birth of a new baby, so what better way to celebrate  "},{"url":null,"title":"brian reade god drop jokes","story":"NewsopinionBrian Reade: God, drop the jokes and give us a Second ComingDave Allen was once askedjoking about Christ would ever be widely accepted – folks, its timeShareCommentsByBrian Reade:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsopinionDave Allen \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSeeing as it’s the last column before Christmas, I thought I’d give it a religious feel. Maybe tell you how the comedian Dave Allen was once asked, after he’d been involved in another blasphemy row,joking about Christ would ever be widely accepted. And how he replied that only when the easily-offended accepted that Jesus was an anti-establishment radical who relentlessly took the mickey out of the old religious bores of his day. I always thought the joker was jesting until I heard a Radio  discussion this week about a book called The Sacred Art of Joking, written by a Church of England Synod member, who claimed Jesus was a great wit who loved offending the rich and powerful, and cracked so many gags about the Pharisees, they eventually had him crucied. Which is not just a comfort to those of us who believe Dave Allen was a genius, but raises some topical questions. With so little to watch on the big man’s birthday, can’t the BBC trawl the Bible and string together a few of his best gags as they’ve got to be funnier than Michael McIntyre’s Christmas Day Special    Don’t all those po-faced moralizers who screamed blasphemy when Greggs replaced Jesus with a sausage roll in their nativity scenes realise it’s what their messiah would have wanted  And is this country growing more absurd by the day because Jesus and his dad have decided to try out on us some of their best material since they dropped a plague of frogs on the Egyptians  We’ve had an Eton wide-boy call a referendum to save his skin, which allowed other Eton wide-boys to fool the people with lies in the hope of getting his job. It’s ended up causing Britain’s gravest peace-time crisis, yet instead of the politicians solving it, they’d rather debate whether the Eton wide-boy’s spectacularly stupid successor was called stupid, before taking a -day break. We’ve got , families homeless this Christmas and a head of state, with more spare rooms in her palaces than she can shake her jewels at, going on TV to wish them all the best. And we’ve seen a football manager, Joseacute Mourinho, given a poundmillion pay-off for failing abjectly, while fans are turning up on match days with groceries to help foodbanks stave off a humanitarian crisis. Our cash-starved NHS is being forced to buy fridges to stockpile drugs when they need to buy beds, and our second biggest airport was brought to a standstill by a geek flying a toy. And that’s before I point out that the world is not only run by a criminal lunatic but mankind is hell-bent on burning it to a cinder. Soyou’re listening, God, drop the jokes and give us a Second Coming.Send your son down to still the storm, let the blind see and the deaf hear, throw the money-lenders out of the City temples, tell tax-avoiding multinationals to give unto Caesar what is Caesar’s, stage mass feedings of the Universal Credit thousands, turn the North Pole water into ice, cast the demon out of the White House and tell Richard Branson he’s not the only beardie who can walk on water.

Peter and Jean Fowlers Christmas dinner was thrown into turmoil after their local Crawshaws refused to accept their stamps. The couple, from Bransholme, Hull, had saved up for months to treat themselves to a turkey, beef, ham and pork over the festive period. Theyve been told that they wont receive a refund until the new year, and they say theyve been forced to borrow money to pay for their Christmas food, Hull Live reports.   The Fowlers had planned to use their stamps at Crawshaws branch in North Point shopping centre. Mrs Fowler, , said: “I have been buying these stamps since January to pay for all the meat this Christmas, and now I’m being told I can’t use them. “I’m on oxygen at the moment and my husband is out of work, so money is very tight for us and we were relying on these stamps. Now we’re being told we won’t be getting a refund until after January.”   Crawshaws, which has shops around the country, went into administration earlier this year. However, the Hull stores were saved from closure after another firm bought them out at the last minute. Mr Fowler, , said: “We’re going to have to borrow the money now to pay for our Christmas meat, but I’m not speaking out just for us. “I can’t help but think about the families out there who are relying on these stamps to feed their children over Christmas, and they might not even know yet they can’t use them.”   Mr and Mrs Fowler were told to send their stamps to the Crawshaw office in order to qualy for a refund, which they were told would take just days. However, they say they have since been told the refund won’t be in their bank accounts until January. Mrs Fowler said: “I photocopied my stamp book and sent it through the post office on recorded delivery. “I did it after seeing a note in the door of the shop saying they would no longer be accepting the stamps and gave us a number to contact. “I appreciate we will be getting a refund but the end of January is just too late. We have been saving this money to use for Christmas, and now we have nothing.” Crawshaws have confirmed the stamps can no longer be redeemed, but customers can claim for a refund by emailing alex.nicholls@uk.ey.

Medics discovered she was suffering from cancer and Dawn had an operation at Bradford Royal Infirmary to remove her womb and oies in July . But the former office worker never properly recovered from the hysterectomy and says she struggled to get answers from doctors about what was wrong with her. It eventually transpired that a surgical sponge had been left inside her - and she underwent an operation to have it removed on November  this year. She is now cancer-free but is still suffering complications from the hysterectomy including kidney problems because of the toxins in her body from the sponge. The complications come after Dawn, from Bradford, West Yorks., was told it would take four months to recover from the initial op. Boy, , accidentally CASTRATED by surgeon and robbed of normal future She said: After the operation, everything got worse and worse. I was annoyed because it has taken them nearly  months to get sorted and Im still in hospital now. I dont like being in hospital because I cant really go anywhere because doctors want to keep an eye on me. To begin with I want an apology. Ive not had one and now I want to know why someone did this and why I didnt get an apology. I would like compensation for what I have been through for the last  months. Its disgusting what I have gone through and now Christmas is on hold because I might be in here. Her husband Andrew, , who used to serve in the military, added: This is a hospital for human beings and it serves the whole of Bradford, so they should have been on the ball. This has dragged on and on, but now we know there was a sponge inside her and her body was attacking it. Now the doctors have said her kidneys are starting to stop working because of the toxins in her body from the sponge. I wouldnt have wished this on my worst enemy because its not nice.   They told me they were glad to have found it when they did, which has made me think what would have happenedthey hadnt found it. Someone needs to own up and say sorry. According to a surgeon, they found a sponge in her womb but my argument is how has it got in there  If someone had come to me and held their hands up the fine, but leaving her that long with something inside her is unbelievable. She is still in hospital and wants answers. We want someone to hold their hands up and say yes, we made a mistake. The couple are now eager to meet with Professor Clive Kay, chief executive of Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, who they hope will investigate what happened. A spokesman for Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: We are carrying out an investigation into Mrs Whites care and treatment and, in line with the trusts policy of openness, we will share our findings with her. We have apologised to Mrs White for any harm or distress we may have caused and will continue to liaise with her as the investigation continues. We set high standards for ourselves and aim to get every patients treatment and care right, and in most cases we do. We are committed to providing high-quality healthcare for every patient.

But what is the legal limit and how long do you need to wait before getting behind the wheel  Road safety charity Brake found that one in five motorists confessed to hitting the road first thing following a boozy bender just hours earlier. Some believe thatthey have been to sleep, that means they are all right to drive - but in fact, you could wake up still over the limit. Drinkaware’s Chief Medical Adviser Dr Paul Wallace said: “The amount of alcohol in your bloodstream depends on three things the amount you take in, over what period of time and the speed at which your body gets rid of it.” Here’s what you need to know: What is the legal drink driving limit   In England and Wales the limit is mg of alcohol per  millilitres of blood,  microgrammes per  millilitres of breath or mg per  millilitres of urine. This limit was imposed in  when the Road Safety Bill was introduced. In  the breathalyser was introduced as a way of testing a persons blood alcohol level. In Scotland the limit was reduced in  too mg of alcohol in every  millilitres of blood. The breath alcohol equivalent was reduced to  microgrammes of alcohol per  millilitres of breath. In most other European countries, the limit is less, usually  milligrammes per  millilitres of blood. In America the nationwide limit is mg but the driving under the influence or DUI offence does not require someone to be over a specic blood alcohol level. Australia has a a nationwide limit of mg for older drivers but a zero-tolerance policy for inexperienced drivers in most states.Most European countries have a limit of mg, which is lowered to mg or mg for drivers who have held licences for under two years. Some countries in Africa including Ethiopia and Malawi have no legal drink drive limit, but other nations have a zero tolerance approach.   How long you need to wait before driving after drinking the night before - based on rough estimates According to the Morning After campaign :-  pints of beer   hours before driving from when youve stopped drinking - One bottle of wine   hours before driving from when youve stopped drinking - Two mojitos, a margarita and a pina colada   and a half hours before driving from when youve stopped drinking - Three single gins and a Jagermeister   and a half hours before driving from when youve stopped drinking-  pints of lager and  ciders   hours before driving from when youve stopped drinking.N.B. The Morning After calculator is only a rough estimate of when it is safe to drive the morning after you have stopped drinking and will not help youyou are arrested.The figures above are estimates and y depending on the inidual.   So how much can I drink and still be under the limit  The amount of alcohol you can drink before youre considered over the limit ies from person to person. It depends on: Your weight, age, sex and metabolismThe type and amount of alcohol you’re drinking Your stress levels What you’ve eaten One alcohol unit is measured as ml or g of pure alcohol. A typical pint contains around one to two units. A glass of wine can be between one and a half to three units, depending on the strength and the size of the glass. Some people could be okay to drive after one or two drinks while some may find themselves over the limit after just one.  How quickly is alcohol removed from the body  Alcohol is removed from the blood at the rate of about one unit an hour - but this ies from person to person. According to the NHS, the speed at which your body processes alcohol can depend on your size, gender, age, the state of your liver, your metabolism, how much food you have eaten, the type and strength of the alcohol you’ve consumed and whether you’re taking medication. Can you speed up the process  No. Drinking lots of water, or eating a big breakfast might help ‘sober you up’, but it won’t actually quicken the speed at which alcohol leaves the body, according to Dr Wallace. You just need to be patient and wait it out, or use a dferent method of travel. What to doyou need to drive the next day Drinkaware suggests the following:Opt for lower strength drinks - that’s % ABV or lower beer and % ABV or lower wine. Choose single measures instead of doubles. Make every other drink a soft drink. Stop drinking before the end of the night, so your body has time to process the alcohol before the morning. What will happenIm caught drink driving  Drink driving is a criminal offence and you can be fined, banned from driving or even face jail depending on the seriousness of the offence. If you are found to be in charge of of a vehicle while above the legal limit or unfit through drink you could face up to three months imprisonment, up to a pound, fine and a possible driving ban. This means you dont even have to be driving to face punishment you could just be sat in your car with, for example, your keys in the ignition. If you are caught driving or attempting to drive while over the limit you could face six months’ imprisonment, an unlimited fine or a driving ban for at least one year . You cant escape justice by refusing to provide a breath specimen or blood or urine. If you refuse to do this it could lead to six months jail, an unlimited fine or a ban from driving for at least a year. Causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink could result in  years’ imprisonment, an unlimited fine, a ban from driving for at least two years or an extended driving test before your licence is ed.

The Duchess of Sussex has long been involved in humanitarian work and has been a passionate advocate for womens rights and equality - and fans cant wait to see what she does next. But according to sources, Meghan is becoming increasingly frustrated with having her ideas for change rejected by the palace. A source told People: The palace is a magical place, and it is also a place where all you hear is no, no, no.  The most dficult job in the royal family is to work with Meghans ambitions and make them realisable. She will get frustratedshe is told, ‘You can’t do this or cant do that. A palace insider said royal aides might not be used to the say-it-as-you-see-it American mentality. Since marrying Prince Harry in May, the former Hollywood actress has had to adapt to all kinds of traditions and limitations that come with le as a royal. Indeed, according to an Us Weekly source, another palace protocol Meghan finds frustrating is not being able to comment on the situation with Thomas Markle. As someone who was able to speak her mind freely on social media not too long ago, these aspects of her new role must be a challenge.  Of her humanitarian work, Meghan wrote on The Tig in  that its the kind of work that feeds [her] soul and fuels her purpose and that she never wanted to be a lady that lunches - so its easy to imagine that she would have plenty of ideas about how to affect change as a Duchess. Meghan is already ruffling some feathers with her impressive work ethic, reports claim, as her am starts and requests are allegedly rocking the boat among royal staff. Although she might be frustrated that the palace hasnt run with all her ideas so far, Meghan has already achieved a considerable amount in her role. The Duchess has been conducting a number of undercover meetings with British citizens associated with good causes, the Mail on Sunday reported. Earlier this year, the Duchess of Sussex launched a charity cookbook to help those affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy and threw herself into a -day royal tour in Oceania - making a poignant speech at the University of the South Pacic in Fiji.

Doctors feared that large cysts compressing her airways could potentially lead to fatal breathing problems at birth. Taylor and Cha were given the devastating news that Eden might not make it past her first day. But at .pm on August , , miracle baby Eden defied all the odds and was delivered by C-section in a room full of doctors, paediatric ENT surgeons and NICU nurses.  She was born with a lymphatic malformation in the form of a mass on her neck. Two years, countless hospital visits and nine treatments later, Eden has kept surprising doctors and defying the odds to become a perfect, happy and beautul little girl. Shes also become a big sister to three-month-old Auggie Raye. In a bid to kick the stigma of her disability, Edens mother Cha has opened up about their lives and has started writing a blog about their journey. Providing an intimate, emotional and personal glance at their lives, Cha opens up about everything: from the dark, scary beginnings of her pregnancy, to disgusting comments from trolls the family have encountered online and finally, the beautul young girl Eden has become. Heres a look at just one of Chas inspirational blog posts, which was originally published on the Love What Matters website.The night before she came, we were up late, Cha writes. I was so anxious. I cried so many times that night. I was so scared of the unknown. How could I be excited when I didn’t know what was going to happen to our baby  I felt a whirlwind of emotions, I was SO excited but more fearful. Will she survive  Will she be breathing  Will I get to see her before they take her  There were so many things going through my mind it was impossible for me to go back to sleep. So, I got out of bed and got ready for one of the biggest and most important days of my le. Too shaky and nervous to drive themselves to the hospital, Cha and Taylor were driven by family members and Cha was hooked up to a number of monitors to observe the baby.  It was strange, sitting there just the two of us, waiting to be rolled back to the operating room. We managed a few nervous smiles and laughs. We kept talking and wishing that we’d soon be a family, and that our baby girl would be OK. I wasn’t nervous at this point. I tried to switch off from what was happening - otherwise, I would have gone into complete frantic mode. I don’t think it had quite hit me yet. But it wasnt long before the true reality of the situation started to set in. All the fear and nerves that I carried right through my pregnancy hit me all at once, Cha writes. Taylor tried to help me stay calm, but he was just as nervous.  This was it - there was no turning back, and for a second, I wished I could have stayed in that moment forever. Where I knew I could keep my baby safe breathing inside me. I had carried her for the past nine months and soon doctors would be taking her away from me, ready to try and save her le. Around  doctors and nurses were involved in the delivery of Eden, so much that they filled the whole corridor outside the operating room. It was such a tiny room - I began to feel claustrophobic. I tried my best to not look at how many people were actually in the room as it made the situation a million times scarier. I was rolled onto the cold operating table to begin [the birth]. Was this really happening   Cha was given spinal pain killers and doctors immediately began the C-section surgery. Taylor kept reassuring me that everything was going fine and suddenly - within  minutes of going into the operating room - I heard the most beautul loud cries! I can’t even tell you what I felt at this moment in time, Cha said. Everyone was in complete shock. Our baby was here and she was crying - just like some miracle. No one was expecting it and even some nurses began to cry with us. I was in complete disbelief. It all felt so surreal. I have never felt a flood of joy like I did that moment we heard our daughter cry. It was something we were told was unlikely to happen - even though I spent nine months praying it would. Eden was taken immediately for medical checks, where doctors made sure she was healthy and her airways were clear.  She was then brought briefly back to Cha, before being whisked away once more to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Tears of joy were streaming down our faces and Taylor stroked my hair and askedI was okay. I only had a quick glimpse of Eden as they had to take her down to the NICU. I wanted her to be warm and safe more than I wanted to hold her right away. I was eventually wheeled out of the OR and brought to the recovery ward. It wasnt long before Chas anaesthetic started to wear off, and as the physical pain increased, so did Chas longing to see her newborn baby. I looked at all the other mothers with their babies and I felt helpless, she writes in her blog. My baby was alone with strangers and I no longer had control of anything. ‘When can I see my baby ’ I asked the nurse who was taking my vitals. Around six hours after giving birth, Cha was finally allowed to meet her daughter, and was taken to the NICU by wheelchair. I was finally able to gaze at our baby through a plastic baby incubator, and although there were wires all over her beautul new skin and into her tiny little nose, they never once stole who she was.  She was beautul even with all those tubes and wires, and I just couldn’t believe she was mine. I stroked her head, staring into her tiny incubator and told her how much I loved her. She was our miracle baby. They finally lted her out of her incubator and I got to hold her. I instantly felt whole again. She completed us. I felt a love that I never knew was possible. I got to hold her for nearly an hour before I had to leave her for the night to get my rest. After such a traumatic pregnancy, Cha and Taylor were warned to prepare for the worst. But after just two days in intensive care, little fighter Eden was moved to the ward with Cha before the two of them were allowed home: which meant Cha and her baby spent the same amount of time in hospital as a normal C-section patient. The weeks that followed were long and slow, and at seven weeks old Eden was admitted into Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital, where she spent nearly a month of her young le.  We did our very best to get her home, Cha said. We fought medical teams and proved our worth. We learned how to care for our daughter beyond the requirements of any parent. We were medically trained. We knew more than some doctors did about her condition. All we knew were hospital walls, MRI scans, and car journeys. I cried every day. We couldn’t have gotten through that time without our family visiting every day. We loved her so much then, as we do now. Finally, baby Eden was allowed home. She came home, and it was a miracle. She defied odds. She proved people wrong. She got rid of tubes and wires like they were nothing at all. We never expected it, but she DID IT. When we found out Eden had a lymphatic malformation, we were scared. We searched the Internet looking for any answers. We were told Eden wouldn’t be normal. We were told she would be malformed. We were told there was a chance she wouldn’t survive.  Cha said doctors were concerned about the size of the mass putting pressure on Edens airways. We were told surgery would be a normal course of le for years to come, she wrote. But, here we are two years on, countless hospital visits and nine treatments later - with our perfect happy little girl. Eden is now two years old and so far has had a total of eight sclerotherapy treatments and a laser and cyst removal on her tongue to help reduce the size of the mass in both her neck and tongue. Shes due to have a tongue reduction in January next year and will eventually undergo serious surgical removal for the remainder of the malformation. I don’t know how its possible, but all of this has just made me love this little girl so much more, Cha writes in her blog. She is such a fighter and my heart grows bigger with love for her every single day.  We won’t let Eden’s illness define her and although we can’t do anything about it, we want to give her the best chance of beating it - physically and emotionally, Cha said. We still have a long journey ahead of us and no-one knows what challenges we may face along the way. We have had to learn to do things we should never have to as parents and we have built up courage that we didn’t know we had. But we have come so far. If I have learned one thing as a mother, its that motherhood is a journey filled with ups and downs. Just when I think I have it all figured out, the game changes, but I still never give up on hope. Above all, rather than trying to be the perfect mother, I try to be the best mother by always giving my best.”This story was was originally published on the Love What Matters website.

Her gown features a neckline that folds around the shoulders to a low back that drapes into a flowing fulltrain, Buckingham Palace said at the time.  Two months later, in the first interview about her condition since the wedding day, Princess Eugenie told The : I believe scars are like memories that tell a story on your body, that remind you of how strong you had to be, and that you survived to talk about it. Your scars are a way of communicating, and sharing a trauma can be healing in so many ways. It can release that stigma you might have given to yourself and by talking about it you can show people how they can heal too.  Princess Eugenie was diagnosed with scoliosis, a condition in which a persons spine is curved, when she was just  years old. She underwent surgery at the Royal National Orthopedic Hospitalin  and had two  inch titanium rods placed in her back. The procedure took eight hours, and Eugenie was in intensive care for three days afterwards.She then spent a further week in the hospital before being discharged.  The princess made a full recovery and is not expected to need any more surgery for the condition. In the latest interview, Princess Eugenie told how the most emotional time for her was before the operation as she was scared of the unknown and of having a condition which made her dferent.She revealed how after the procedure she couldnt move while she was in hospital. Then the princess had to wear a neck brace for months, making her feel frustrated and angry about not being able to play. But she trusted in doctors and parents who told her she would be OK, and she was.As a teen, she admitted she would hide her brace and was very closed about her scar. But as the years went on and she grew up, she became proud of showing it and realised she could help others in doing so.And as she had fittings for the wedding gown, she knew her dress designers had understood her vision.Eugenies dress also included a number of symbols that are meaningful to her as mots, including a thistle for Scotland acknowledging the couples fondness for Balmoral, a Shamrock for Ireland as a nod to the brides Ferguson family, and the York Rose and ivy representing the couples home.

Four stowaways were arrested and control was restored when about two dozen Special Boat Service officers boarded the Grande Tema in the Thames Estuary between Essex and Kent. The ,-tonne ships operator, Grimaldi Lines, said four stowaways had been found on board by the crew earlier this week and they managed to escape after being locked in a cabin. As the Italian cargo vessel approached the UK on Friday morning, the stowaways threatened crew with iron bars and demanded that it sail close to the shore so they could jump off, the operator said as the drama unfolded.   The four men have been detained under the Immigration Act. The ft ship was sailing to Tilbury, Essex, after setting off from Lagos, Nigeria, on December , when the stowaways were found. The Grande Temas crew members were feeding them according to international regulations, said Grimaldi Lines, but the stowaways escaped. After being threatened at about am on Friday, the crew locked themselves on the ships bridge and sent out an alert to the Coastguard, it is said.  Essex Police were alerted as trouble erupted on board, and Royal Navy helicopters and commandos were called in to retake control. The operation lasted less than half an hour. SBS operatives from Sabre Squadron fast-roped from helicopters on to the ship, sources told Sky News. Essex Police said officers boarded the ship around pm on Friday and it was taken to the Port of Tilbury in Essex.  The Grande Tema, which is based in Palermo, Sicily, and was carrying car parts, arrived there at just after .am on Saturday, according to MarineTraffic. It had  crew members from countries including Italy and the Philippines. The ship was being unloaded on Saturday. Essex Police was called at around .am on Friday, and the ship spent hours circling at the mouth of the estuary before it was boarded by special forces.  Before the crew regained control, Paul Kyprianou, a spokesman for Grimaldi Lines, told Sky News: We found four stowaways on the vessel. The vessel was coming from Nigeria and was bound to Tilbury, and those four stowaways were in the cabin, and todaythey managed to escape from the cabin and they started threatening the crew, requesting the master of the vessel navigating very close to the coast. That request was probably because they wanted to jump and reach the British coast. The crew reacted and they locked themselves in the bridge of the vessel and so they are safe, we havent had any injuries. Essex Police said the ship was secure and there were no reports of injuries.

University professor Sue Black forged a successful career in the technology industry despite struggles in her early le. She is now one of  women to appear on a list of the most highly regarded female tech moguls published by the respected American business magazine, Forbes. However, a career in the tech sector was not always mapped out for her and she was forced to battle back from struggles in early le. She told Chronicle Live: I dropped out of school at  and had three kids by . Then my marriage broke down and I became a single parent living on benefits.  I decided that the only way to make something of myself would be education, so I studied for my A Levels in the evenings and then applied to uni to study computing. I just thought that technology was the future and that it was going to change the world. During Dr Blacks -year career in the software industry she has earned a PhD and been awarded three honorary doctorates. She now works as a lecturer in Durham Universitys computer science department and is also the founder of Techmums, an author and a government advisor. Speaking about her latest achievement, Dr Black said: Im amazed. I woke up this morning and, as usual, went straight on to Twitter and saw messages from my friends congratulating me about it. The reaction has been wonderful. Ive had a long career in tech and been fortunate to have been recognised in the past but this is just great.  Dr Black has only recently started at Durham as a senior academic but said that she loves working in the North East. She told the Chronicle: I love it at Durham. Its a great university and such a nice city too. Ive always wanted to do something in the area as Ive got a connection to the region. My great grandfather Sydney Ambury was from Sunderland and served in the Northumberland Fusiliers in Gallipoli. Alongside her extensive academic portfolio, Dr Black was brought into the universitys computer science team to boost the number of women applying to study at the institution. They really want to get some more female students at Durham and next year its one of my main goals. Im looking at what other universities have done, such as the progress made by Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania.  Six years ago, Dr Black founded Techmums - classes for women to learn programming skills - to help mums build confidence and encourage them into education. She is concerned that the UK does not bang the drum loud enough for women in the technology sector despite an illustrious history of female programmers. In , she published the fastest crowd-funded book of all time, Saving Bletchley Park, which described her campaign to save the WW codebreaking site where many women worked.

Emily - not her real name - from south London has said the UK has ed to Victorian England where women have to turn to sex work and X-rated films in order to feed their children. The mum-of-three gave up her porn career for her children but now fears she will have toto adult films just to feed them. The cruel new benefit system is being rolled out in her area and Emily is fearful she could be left waiting weeks on end for her first payment leaving her with no choice but to do porn for quick cash. Emily is a mum-of-three and despite working part-time, she is worried her benefits could be cut under the new system. Have you been affected by Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror  Her daughter is disabled and Emily says she would rather put herself at risk and do porn than let her childs quality of le suffer. During her s, Emily worked as apornstar and modelled for several lads mags. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Emily said: “It’s like we’ve ed to Victorian times with mums having to do X-rated videos or prostitute themselves in order to put food in their children’s bellies. How has it come to this  “I don’t want to go back topornbut what  can I do  I’ll make pound for a few scenes and still be home in time to collect my kids from school. At least I have that option to make some good cash, other people don’t.” Emily spent her younger years in care after being abused by members of her family.In her late teens, her then boyfriend convinced her to respond to a call for models in a top lads mag.  She was then offered a large sum of money to star in apornfilm and her X-rated career continued for the next decade. Emily, now is her s, spent years travelling Europe to star in films and while she did not enjoy the work, she did it for the money and the freedom that offered her. “I used to just zone out,” she said. “They used to coerce me into doing things I didn’t want to do but I just thought of the money and got on with it. It did end up causing me a very bad injury...down there. I had to go to hospital, it was really traumatic but I went back for the money. “It felt very glamorous at the time, because I had lovely clothes to wear, had my make-up done, and I felt very special. No one had ever made me feel special.   “I felt good about it at the time but I was younger then. “I was talked into it by the vast amount of money I was offered basically. “It would have been around pound for sex with a male model - hardcore porn. “It’d take a couple of hours, I’d had HIV tests all the time because some of the male models did gay porn as well. “I really liked doing the magazine shoots and that because it wasn’t dangerous. “When you’re on a porn shoot, you put on a persona, it’s like a mask.   “But I look back and I feel ashamed, I was brought up in a very religious household. “I think theres a real stigma about porn in the UK, it’s just not the done thing is it  “People treat me terribly when they find out. Eventually, Emily left thepornindustry and became a lap dancer. But she gave it up when she fell pregnant with her first child and has not looked back since - until now. She said: Once I had my daughter I got a normal job and focused on being a mum, I thought that part of my le was over. Id be disgustedI had to go back. The fear of being left with little or nothing to live on has forced her to get in touch with herporncontacts again in case she needs to make some quick cash.  “I’ve been asked to go back lots of times over the years and I never did it,” she said. “I look back and I’m ashamed of it,I’d been brought up in a nice home and not abused, I might be married and have a nice le. My daughter is disabled, she suffers from a learning disability and goes to special school, I cant work full-time because of child care costs and childminders dont like having her because of her behaviour. I take her to lots of dferent activities like horse riding and swimming which help her and I dont want to have to stop all thatmy benefits are cut. “If I go back to porn I’m putting myself at risk because this is unprotected sex - I’m at risk of HIV and other STIs. “I feel utterly degraded even thinking about going back to it especially because I never thought I would have to do this again. “But I can’t get another job so this is an easy way to make money while the kids are at school.  “I don’t want to go back to it but I’d do anything - even prostitute myself - to feed my kids. “I’d be too embarrassed to queue up at a food bank or beg people to donate gts for my children at Christmas. “I just couldn’t do it, but at least this way I could make enough money to take my daughter to her activities. Her mobility allowance has already been cut and I cant get public transport with her. Emily has even started stockpiling tins of food over fears of not having enough money to feed her kids. “I’ve started buying extra tins and putting them away. People advise you to start stockpiling non-perishables, like beans, tuna etc, so I can have a few week’s worth of food just in case, she said.

We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. “Universal Credit is always in the back of my mind, I lie awake at night thinking, I can’t afford these bills, what the hell is going to happen  “I feel so anxious, the government shouldn’t do this. People can go to food banks but how are they supposed to survive like that long-term  I jut want my kids to have a dferent le to what I had. Emily has set up a gofundme page to raise money for her daughters sensory room.

People living in the potential flood zones have been warned to be prepared, as the Met Office expects wet and windy weather over the next few days. Rain will be heavy at times as it sweeps across the nation on Saturday night and Sunday, setting up a soggy start to the festive period as millions hit the roads. But rain will begin to taper off on Christmas Eve, while Christmas Day is expected to be mostly dry and cloudy with some patchy rain.  It means those hoping for a white Christmas will be disappointed. Temperatures will stay mild over the next week - hitting the double digits in some regions - but they wont be pleasant in places where it is wet and windy. The Environment Agency has issued  flood alerts for England, while Natural Resources Wales has issued five. Many streams are almost at capacity, and further rain could see them breach their banks, putting homes, businesses and roads at risk of flooding. Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern told the Express: “There will be a frost in the north of Scotland on Saturday morning.  “Chilly start to the day, here, temperatures a few degrees below freezing. “One or two fog patches, as well, that will all clear up and a crisp, sunny day to come for the north-east of Scotland.” Long spells of sunshine are expected across much of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, he added, with showers affecting mostly western and central parts of Scotland. But showers will spread across the country in the evening and weather fronts will bring a wet start to the day on Sunday, he said. Heavy rain will move into the Midlands, East Anglia, northern England, Northern Ireland and the south of Scotland. It will be breezy in places.  Journey times are expected to be longer in severe weather. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day will be dry in most places. Ladbrokes has slashed its odds that Christmas Day this year will be the warmest ever. Its now a   chancethat the mild temperatures will set a new record. The odds of a white Christmas are  .Jessica Bridge, a spokeswoman for Ladbrokes, said: Unfortunately, it now looks like were going to have a wet Christmas instead of a white one, but the country can at least rejoice in the warm temperatures on offer.

Southerly winds will bring mild air across many parts making Boxing Day a rather cloudy affair with drizzly patches over western coasts and hills. The best of any bright or sunny spells likely in the east or north-east. What is the New Years Eve forecast  A precise forecast for New Years Eve will become clearer in the next few days, but temperatures are expected to be average.

She now earns up to pound, per week and, in her own words, has made her le comfortable for her family as a result, Birmingham Live reports.I had an argument with my mum and I left home, explained Cindy, , who fell pregnant two years after leaving home. I stayed at my nans for a bit before moving to a horrible sh**hole in Kingstanding. I was living off pound in benefits.  I couldnt even afford to get to college and I contemplated not having my baby because I couldnt afford a child. I reached rock-bottom. During a time of desperation Cindy, from Great Barr, Birmingham, was introduced to exotic dancing and web cam work by a friend. I started dancing and a friend of mine suggested Id do web-camming, she added. I was like, Oh my God but I decided to give it a go. Ive been doing it ever since and now Ive got my own apartment, a nice new BMW X and I can afford to support my -year-old son.

She charges pound-a-minute and aims to keep men logged on for as long as possible. What Id do is Id get ready, put all my make-up on and all the sexy lingerie and Id spend around three hours at a time sitting there talking to men, she said.  Its all online and it goes ding-ding when someone wants to speak to you. You cant really go off and do other things and it can be quite tedious but I keep them talking for as long as possible, asking them where theyre from and stuff. I type instead of speaking because it takes longer. Everything can come off, bra and knickers. I have to put on the website that Im working that day and Im available. I dont do it all the time because it can be too much, you can lose yourself. Since going public about my work, Ive literally had  or so girls inbox me on Facebook asking about how I got into it and what its like. I tell them its so easy and the money is great but, once you get into it, theres no getting out.  Ive tried other jobs but nothings as easy and so well paid. What Id tell girls is to be very careful, it can take over your le which is why Ive tried to step back a little. Ive been doing it since I was a teenager. Girls I know have gotten into drugs to deal with their work - so it can be a dangerous game. Its my job and now I can afford nicer things in le and I can afford to support my family. Ive got no shame, none whatsoever.   Its a million miles away from where I was thats for sure, sitting there eating noodles at Christmas. When askedshed ever give web-camming up, Cindy added: No, its always there for me and its a job. You do lose your pride but Id prefer to lose that and have food on the table. Im not a millionaire, Im a mum who just wants to provide for her family. Were looking forward to a great Christmas, just like everyone .

What an absolute unit. She c h o n k. Look at the size of this lady. OH LAWD SHE COMIN, the tweet continued. The tweet garnered more than , likes and was retweeted over , times. However it was also highly-criticised, prompting the aquarium to issue an apology acknowledging it had used problematic and insensitive references.  This is shamefully appropriative language, one user commented. Others voiced concerns that using language associated with black womens bodies to describe an animal was dehumanising. Were posting here in the thread so that people who have engaged with this tweet will join us in our learning moment, the aquarium apologised. If our tweet alienated you, please know that we are deeply sorry, and that we offer our sincerest apologies. If you follow our feed, we often reference popular memes to talk about the ocean. In this case, the memes used had connotations we were unaware of until now.  In particular, several terms referenced originated from African American Vernacular Englishand specically reference Black womens bodies. Using them in a sea otter meme without that background makes insinuations we never intended. We need to do better. The aquarium is also answering questions about the actual photo as Abby looks overweight in it, but this is apparently not the case in reality.

She said: I don’t know his name. I don’t know how much he weighed. I don’t knowthey chose to do surgery.  When Stephanie was  weeks pregnant, medics told her the boy had a serious heart defect, it is reported. His biological parents ordered her to abort him because of the high risks involved - but she refused to do so, the Daily Mail reports. I thought we were completely on the same page...I had no idea thatsomething did happen, we’d be so ided, Stephanie said in an interview with WFAA.Before you proceed in carrying for a couple, you discuss your beliefs on abortion, you have to have really hard conversations.  Stephanie went ahead with the pregnancy and gave birth on December  last year at the Medical City Womens Hospital in Dallas. But just moments after the baby boy was born, he was taken away by hospital staff and Stephanie says she didnt see him again.The mum said she has been through mourning and heartache as a result - adding that she doesnt even knowhe is healthy.She has had to reach out to legislators and is fighting for stricter written contracts for biological parents and surrogates, it is reported.

The attack began when Burachowski struck the -year-old victim in the head with a backpack in the schools band room, court documents claim. He then tried to sodomise the bow with a drumstick through his trousers at Spaulding High School in the US city of Barre, Vermont, it is claimed.   The documents also claim Pierce recorded video of the assault on her phone, local TV news station WCAX reported. She is accused of sharing video of part of the attack on Snapchat following the incident late last month.In the footage, she is heard encouraging the attack and laughing behind the camera, the documents claim. Washington County States Attorney Rory Thibault said: “Theres a signicant amount of ridicule of the victim leading up to this, so it was clearly an abusive and harassing situation.   Burachowski is charged with attempted sexual assault, aggravated assault and aggravated disorderly conduct. The attempted sexual assault carries a penalty of up to le in prison. Pierce is charged with aiding in the commission of aggravated assault, aggravated disorderly conduct and distributing indecent material to a minor and also denies the charges. Both have denied the charges. Mr Thibault said: I think its incredibly important to make sure when something does go awry at a school that we respond in a way that promotes public safety and hopefully healing for those involved.  Barre City police have seized Pierces mobile phone. But Pierce and her family have refused to give investigators the pass code so they can attempt to retrieve the full video or any other evidence from the device, it is claimed. The alleged victim has moved schools. Mr Thibault said: Its horrible any time any student has to not go to school because theyre afraid for their own personal safety.

Sightings of the mystical Scottish beast have reached another record for this century after Caroline Barnett, , saw Nessie over the internet. The business consultant from Farmborough, near Bath was tuning into the Loch Ness Webcam at .am on Wednesday when she clocked something move up the loch. She told the Daily Record: It popped up and down - and kept doing it. It kept splashing about. It was quite a size - the size of a boat but it was hard to tell because it was the other side of the loch. I have been to Loch Ness a few years ago but never saw Nessie then. I didnt knowI believed in her but this is certainly some Christmas present and quite a surprise. I took quite a few videos but my phone died. I dont know what it is - it really is unexplained. Experts have accepted the images. Initially she thought it was a boat or similar but the object appeared animate and then disappeared into the water before reappearing. It was dark in colour and nearer the east shore of the loch, said Gary Campbell, recorder of the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register.   The sighting - the th this year - comes just six days a best-selling author saw a mysterious creature with a ft neck and a head the size of a rugby ball.Ricky D Phillips, a British military historian - whose works include The First Casualty, The Untold Story of the Falklands War - said he was baffled by the sight. Mr Phillips from Edinburgh also works as a tour guide and was leading a party of eight foreign tourists who went on a cruise on Loch Ness while he went a got a chippy. It was as he rested at the River Oich, just as it flows into Loch Ness at Fort Augustus, that Mr Phillips saw the strange sight at .pm. It was a grey creature - almost bird like - in a grey stretch of water. Its neck was three to four feet long, a head the size of a rugby ball and a ridge across its eyes, said Mr Phillips, .I was baffled. The previous Wednesday I had heard a strange noise as I was stood by a cafe at the edge of the loch in Fort Augustus. The noise sounded almost metallic, but like something was blowing air - like Darth Vader.   I have swum and sailed with whales and dolphins, seen hundreds of seals, and it sounded like nothing I have ever heard. I spun around and saw something grey, just a side of a body and a flipper. Okay, this could have been something explainable, so I left quite interested but unsure. The noise was really weird though. Then last Thursday after my tour party went on their cruise I decided to take a walk along the river Oich, mainly to see the old bridge, and was taking a few pictures of the loch and the scenery when I again heard that curious noise. I looked up from my phone and saw a long, straight neck, all completely grey, and a narrow face, which was only about ft away and then it turned and disappeared all in a few seconds. I looked down and realised that it was in my picture, so zoomed in and there it was. It actually looks like a giant bird or a peacock in the face, with high ridges above its eyes and what almost looks like a beak. I know dinosaurs came from birds and that many had hard lips, almost like a beak - but this is simply what I saw. It seems to have almost a frill on its neck. It is very odd. All I will say is that,I was going to fake a Nessie, I would certainly have made it look less like a bird and more like... well, more like what we think Nessie looks like!   The image has been accepted by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register. It is a record year for seeing Nessie this century, said Mr Campbell. Sightings are now at a level that were being recorded in the s. There are more visitors to the Highlands now so that may have something to do with it. It was in , Mr Campbell saw something resembling a mini whale - with a black shiny back - at the south end of the loch. Since then Mr Campbell has researched and logged over  sightings. He accepted  sightings this year, but one referred to an image taken in  and will be logged for that year - meaning that Nessie has been sighted  times in . In  there were  sightings, then a record for this century. In recent years the most sightings in a year we have had is  - and that was in . Before that the s and s were the times that had most sightings - sometimes more that  in a year, added Mr Campbell. According to Google there are , searches each month for the Loch Ness Monster. The monster mystery was estimated recently to be worth poundm to the region. Irish missionary St Columba is first said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in AD. Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in  by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson. The image was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged.

The footage, captured off the iconic Hyams Beach, Jervis Bay, Australia this morning, shows the large predator swimming around  metres from swimmers in the sea. Jervis Bays Hyams Beach is a stunning tourist spot and also home the large numbers of sharks. When theyre spotted near the shore, people are often told by officials to get out of the water, but there was no such evacuation on this occasion.  Drone pilot Christopher Joye, who captured the footage, said: Swimmers would not believe there was a large great white shark about  metres from them. I was piloting the drone about m and sent folks to warn them. I have spotted over six great whites near Hyams Beach in the last week.  However, its quite common for sharks to be spotted in this part of Australia. This is a great white shark breeding ground and probably one of the most shark infested beaches in the world, Christopher continued. I spotted two other sharks near the beach on the same flight I saw the big great white.  Although most shark attacks do occur less than  metres from the shore, attacks on humans are still extremely rare. Thats not to say you should stay in the wateryou spot one though. Official advice suggests beach-goers should avoid swimming at dawn and dusk, when sharks are more likely to be hunting avoid swimming at river mouths or in murky, discoloured waters and avoid swimming in or around schools of baitfish.

That was always going to be the case no matter the result.“We’ve got some good players but we need some help.“We’re bottom for a reason so we’ve got to try to strengthen otherwise it’ll be a long season.“I don’t look at where we are just now.“I look at performances, responsibility taken by players in games and the consistency of what we’ve been getting, the decisions being made when a couple of things go against us and how we react.“That’s what I look at and will determine what I need.”Right from kick-off the Dark Blues were second best as Aberdeen moved to within a point of leaders Rangers.Cosgrove’s strikes in  and  minutes sealed the points before calamity at a corner where Andy Boyle and Nathan Ralph bundled each other over to allow Andy Considine a free header just after the break signalled a long second half ahead for the Dark Blues.The manager said: “It wasn’t good enough. Simple. No excuses. We were miles off it. Aberdeen were stronger and quicker and bullied us.“We were too meek. We need to show far far more.“When you look at the corners and losing at set-plays – you’re assigned a man and it’s not the first time I’ve seen it.“It was frustrating and disappointing. It was our game in hand but it was an opportunity.”Gensy Kusunga and Lewis Spence were both forced off through injury.Jim added: “Kusunga looks like he’s hurt his hamstring.

They are all sending me pictures so I block them on social media.

We are playing today and then the th, there is no midweek game so it is perfect.“Listen, I live for playing football, I live and breathe football, so for me there is nothing better than having Christmas and then a game right away.”And, for Siegrist, the best Christmas presents he’ll get will be maximum points from Falkirk and Alloa.If United go about their business the way they did up at Inverness last weekend, he believes they will do exactly that.Although that Highland trip saw them have to fight back to earn a point, he believes the level of performance bodes well for what lies ahead in the league programme.“You never know what that point is worth until you finish the season, so that might be a very good one. However, the gaffer spoke about it to us during the week and the way we played compared to the week before at Morton was miles better.“That’s the way we want to play and we believe it gives us the best chance of winning every game or at least most of the games.“You are not going to walk through this league but we like to play with high tempo, pass the ball and cause problems for the opposition we can take advantage of. We just need to put it all together and get the three points.“We should be full of confidence the way we played last week because we know not every opposition can withstand the pressure we put on them.“It’s all about our performance, the way we go on the pitch and put into practice what we think we want to do.“The ability we have in the dressing-room, the characters we have, I think we have a really good team whether that’s in terms of spirit or ability.”After injury forced him off in the recent defeat against Ayr and forced him to miss the draw at Morton, Siegrist admits being recalled to the line-up last weekend was a boost for him.So far this term, one of his biggest battles has been to claim a starting place ahead of Matej Rakovan but that was an indication he’s now considered the first choice keeper by boss Robbie Neilson.“I’ve kind of over-extended when I was ing in the game against Ayr and it was a mixture between a knock and a muscle injury.

Here it is, in full, below.Congratulations on your purchase of Dundee United. I guess the obvious first question is why Dundee United My son Scott and I have been looking for investment in European football for some time. We looked at a lot of dferent options, and we looked at this particular club, the club#s history, the support of the fans, the previous success and rich history.The Irish history appealed because we are of Irish descent. We know the Club had financial issues and that makes it dficult for any Club to be successful.For the Club staff to work within that scenario where there is financial dficulty, you are hampered by that. Decisions are then based on where you are at rather than the best interests of the Club. We felt it was a sleeping giant and we could come in with our advisors and use our business experience to make a dference and get Dundee United back where it needs to be.How much did buying United cost you I will not answer that question directly but what I will say is I have seen some numbers thrown about out there and I wish we were buying it for as little as that! It comes to a combination of money paid to shareholders, money put in for the retirement of debt and a commitment to working capital to ensure funds going forward to do what we need to do to be successful.How long has buying a sporting opportunity in Europe been an interest or passion for you It has been there for several years. Scott#s passion for European football goes back much longer than that. It was his passion that rubbed off on me. His English team is Newcastle United, and we caught a match a few years back and had a lot of fun. In the last year, we really took the interest seriously.Are you looking to make money from this deal Yes. This isn#t a hobby for us, and we expect to make money long-term but, let me say, for that to happen we need to be competing in the Ladbrokes Premiership on a continual basis.How much do you know about Dundee United and Scottish football I know a ton. We spent a tremendous amount of time and money doing our due diligence. Legally, on the business side and on the performance side. We know a lot about Dundee United, and we have researched Scottish football, and we know where we are and where we want to go. We have an excellent plan to get where we want to go.Do you expect to own Dundee United for several years Yes. I expect to own the team long-term.What would you say to reassure Dundee United fans about the long-term future of the Club I guess what I would say is based on the due diligence conducted, spending a lot of time and money researching, we know what we are getting into. This isn#t just a passing fancy where we are going to get in and discover something that would create any issues for us. We are confident about what we are getting into and where we want to go. We would not invest in the Clubwe weren#t convinced about the long-term future of the Club.How does this purchase affect the structure of the Club Mike Martin has stepped down as Chairman, and I would like to recognise the work Mike has done during the process. He is a big fan of the Club, and he has steadied the ship since his appointment in March.As new owners, we are going to take it in a dferent direction. We plan to appoint a Managing Director who will be in charge of running the Club and he will be responsible for the aspects of the commercial and business side of the Club.We will also have a Sporting Director who will be responsible for all the performance aspects of the Club. He will work with Robbie Neilson efficiently and effectively from the Club’s standpoint.We will be making some announcements in the very near future regarding this.What type of Chairman would you describe yourself So I’ll be the Chairman and my son Scott will be the quasi-Vice Chairman. He will sit on the board with me. From a Club perspective, people can expect that I#ll be interested in all that is going on I will be very supportive of what#s going on and who is doing it I will be available whenever, but I will not be a micro-manager. We will have what we think are the right persons in the right positions to be a successful Club and I will absolutely expect results.From a fan perspective, I will be a low profile Chairman and fans will hear more from the Club leadership in the new structure than they will from me.Do you plan to work remotely Yes. I will work remotely and travel over as much as possible. Scott and I have talked about this. We will have board meetings that we will come over for, but we will try to tag-team and come across at separate times, so at least one of us is here as often as possible.How can you get a feel for the Clubyou aren#t over in Dundee With today#s technology it is almost asyou are over there but having the right people in the right positions is what matters. Jimmy Fyffe and David Dorward are still on the board, and we anticipate one or two other people to be on the board from the Dundee area. It is essential for the fans to know we will definitely have local representation and they will be in constant communications.There are American owners at Dundee FC, also within the city. So let me ask this directly. Do you have any plans to merge the clubs No. None whatsoever.Do you have any links at all with the owners of Dundee FC No, I have never met them, and quite frankly I do not even know who they are.Do you have any links to the previous owners of the Club including Stephen Thompson No, I have heard his name, but I have never met or had a discussion with Stephen Thompson. Obviously, I have met Mike Martin and Jimmy Fyffe.You have an interest in a Baseball team. What experience have you gained that will stand you in good stead for a football team based in Dundee I believe firmly, that a person needs to know their limitations. As Chairman and owner that is the situation. As far as performance of the squad aspect of the Club is concerned, I expect to be consulted with, I will be involved and interested in decisions, but in reality, I will defer the main decisions to those that know the game much better than I do. As I said previously, I#m not going to micro-manage. I expect to be much more involved in the business side.Have you spoken to the Head Coach and can you confirm that you see him leading the team forward So when I travelled across recently, I was introduced to Robbie, but quite frankly I don#t even think he knew who I was! I just happened to be a visitor who was introduced. That#s been the extent so far, but in answer to your question, I absolutely do believe he is the man to lead the team forward. He has made a positive impact since his arrival, and he has proven himself with Hearts before.Will he be given financial backing to help in the task of getting the Club back into the Ladbrokes Premiership I guess what I’d say is that it is not an open chequebook, but we absolutely intend to invest the necessary funds to get us into a position to get promoted. Equally important is when we get up we stay there.You will appreciate supporters will be curious and apprehensive about motives. How do you plan to communicate with fans of Dundee United Talk is cheap. What I would say to our supporters is judge us by our actions and, even more importantly judge us on our results. Obviously, due to the structure that I#ve discussed earlier, we will be implementing changes, and the fans will hear from the Club leadership rather than me.What targets do you intend to set for the team and the Club as a whole Let me answer it this way. We are looking at short-term and longer-term targets. The short-term objective is simple # promotion to the Premiership. We expect it is this year absolutely. We need to be United and have the one vision, # success # and get to the Premiership. The timing of the transaction is excellent. We have a transfer window shortly in January, and this will allow us to get with Robbie and figure out the team, andwe need to make some changes, we are ready and willing to do that.Longer-term, maybe three to five years, we need to be competing in the top six of the Premiership. We want to be competing in European competition and challenging in the cups. That#s our ultimate goal."},{"url":null,"title":"parking stays free","story":"Free weekend parking introduced to tempt people into Perth and Kinross town centres for Christmas shopping will run until the new year.Council bosses lted charges at a number of car parks on Saturdays in a bid to get tills ringing before Christmas Day.With the sales kicking in immediately afterwards, the scheme will continue for the final Saturday of the year, December , to entice bargain hunters.Off-street car parks with waived fees on Saturdays include  in Perth city centre, three each in Blairgowrie and Pitlochry, two in Dunkeld and James Square in Crieff."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-charles-rennie-mackintosh-statue-given-cone-treatment-10-days-after-being-unveiled","story":"THE city looks to have quickly taken its newest statue to heart - as itrsquos given the Glasgow cone treatment."},{"url":null,"title":"better-bus-services-are-arriving-says-boss","story":"Bus bosses say passengers will quickly begin to see improvements from a multi-million pound investment."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-wagamama-staff-have-spring-in-their-step-after-christmas-bonus-announcement","story":"Staff at three Glasgow restaurants are over the moon after finding out they will be given Christmas bonuses worth up to pound,."},{"url":null,"title":"planning-boost-in-bid-to-build-new-suburb-in-glasgows-north-east","story":"A BID for  new homes in north Glasgow has taken a leap forward."},{"url":null,"title":"bongos-bingo-behind-one-of-glasgows-wildest-club-nights","story":"SINCE first hitting Glasgow back in , Bongos Bingo has become a regular fixture on the social calendar having racked up more than a dozen events in this year alone."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-star-leigh-griffiths-returns-to-social-media","story":"CELTIC ace Leigh Grfiths has broken his social media silence for the first time since stepping away from the club due to ongoing personal issues."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-and-australias-argument-over-tom-rogic-is-a-real-soap-opera","story":"GRAHAM Arnold was granted face-time with Brendan Rodgers on his recent visit to Scotland and came away unexpectedly with an extra player in Martin Boyle."},{"url":null,"title":"airnbnb-glasgow-city-council-bans-estate-agent-from-running-holiday-let","story":"AN estate agent has been banned from running an Airbnb let in a residential block on Glasgowrsquos West End in a landmark case."},{"url":null,"title":"deliveroo-glasgow-delivery-drivers-sacked-en-masse-just-days-before-christmas","story":"TWENTY courier drivers have been sacked just days before Christmas after being accused of fraud by a worldwide delivery service."},{"url":null,"title":"as-the-world-was-partying-we-were-welcoming-babies-meet-the-staff-in-charge-of-glasgows-festive-deliveries","story":"WHILE most of us are opening presents and tucking into turkey, staff at Glasgowrsquos maternity hospitals will be making sure the cityrsquos very special Christmas deliveries have a safe arrival.

The minister did not seem to realise that many living in my constituency donrsquot feel they have benefited from the city deal and this must change.In his question, Mr Stone said: ldquoA whole shed load of money has been spent in Inverness but precious little has been spent in the out laying areas. That is surely not in the spirit of the deal and should there not be an audit of this sort of deal in the future Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Elizabeth Truss, replied: ldquoWe are doing city deals right across Scotland they are having huge benefits for the local economy.A similar argument was restated in the council chamber by Derek Macleod, the member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh who held up a picture of some of the investment projects.He said: ldquoA picture tells a thousand words, that map tells a story, it is time for a region deal as opposed to a city-region deal because out with Inverness and the Inner Moray Firth you could list on one hand the tangible contributions of this programme.Highland Council leader Margaret Davidson responded by saying there were benefits but that more bodies had to come forward to apply for funding rather than waiting for it to be handed out.She said: ldquoWe have got ultra fast broadband ndash the only council in Scotland to get that ndash so we can [help] Inverness, Fort William, Wick and Thurso.

We all saw the benefits of having had a left-back in Max andwe can get something like that it might be something we would look at.”Lowe has made  appearances for the Dons this season and has been a regular starter in recent months.Derby boss Lampard opted not to extend Lowe’s loan deal because he is short on left-back options. Scotland international left-back Craig Forsyth suffered a serious knee injury this month that is expected to keep him out for the rest of the campaign.Swedish international Marcus Olsson is still recovering from a long-term knee injury, leaving Scott Malone as the only senior left-back available.McInnes said: “Derby have injury issues with a couple of their left-backs.“Max is going back to play. The feedback is that he is not just going back to sit on the bench.“They have been watching him closely and they see the development in him and how well he has done for us.“I am not surprised Derby feel he can go back there and play now.”While McInnes aims to bring in another left-back in January, he insists there is no panic to land the right candidate as there are players who can operate in that position already at the club.Andy Considine, currently playing at right centre-back while Mikey Devlin is out injured until the new year, has played left-back in recent seasons.McInnes said: “There are people in the building that can play left-back.“We will have defenders coming back in January as well with Mikey Devlin, Mark Reynolds and Tommie Hoban, which helps that side of it.”Centre-back Reynolds ed to full-training yesterday for the first time since undergoing knee surgery in July.McInnes said: “Mark was back in full training and it is brilliant to have him back.“He has been there or thereabouts with us for the last few weeks doing bits and pieces.”Aberdeen will today face Hearts in the knowledge a fourth straight win will keep them in the mix at the top of the Premiership.They are just three points behind leaders Celtic, who they host on Boxing Day.Hearts are reeling after suffering a - loss to Livingston and McInnes expects a reaction.He said: “When you lose that type of game all you do is work even harder.“Hearts have had a whole week to get ready for this game so I am pretty sure they will have been working and getting organised to try to come up here to be harder to play against.“On the back of that matchI don’t think it makes our game any easier.“When you lose like that you expect a reaction from your team and Hearts are too good a team not to have a reaction.“They have too much experience and ability and a good manager who will get them back to winning ways before long. We just have to hope it is after today.”The top five of the Premiership is so congested the Dons could conceivably be sitting top of the table at New Yearthey can maintain their winning streak before the winter shutdown.McInnes refuses to look that far ahead.He said: “It is good that we are in and around it but we are just looking at the next game against Hearts.“However, there is no doubting we can clearly see the benefits of getting consecutive wins.”McInnes has challenged the Reds to beat Hearts today to reach the -point mark at the Premiership’s halfway stage.He said: “We felt it was important to hit the  points after  games.“Hearts is the th game of the Premiership and the halfway stage and it’s normally where we are, on target to break  points.“I said to the players prior to the St Mirren game they have three games to get to  points.“We’ve had those two wins since then, and have taken nine points since Livingston .“Now we go and try to get the next three against Hearts.“If we can win to get that it will give a more familiar reflection of what we normally produce at that halfway stage.”Winger Gary Mackay-Steven is out of today’s clash as he is still recovering from concussion having been knocked unconscious in the - Betfred Cup loss to Celtic on December .He could be fit to face Celtic at Pittodrie on Boxing Day.

A government that can lead us through the Brexit impasse that currently exists.“We are at risk of leaving the EU without a deal, a position I hope we can all agree would be disastrous, not just for the people of Aberdeen, but the UK as a whole.”Speaking after the meeting, Ms Laing said she had hoped the SNP would back her call for a general election.She added: “Unfortunately the rhetoric that comes with the SNP was fully on show today in that they say in public they want a general election but when they get an opportunity to vote for one they vote against it.”Backing a people’s vote, SNP group leader Stephen Flynn said the council had to defend the % of the city’s population who are EU nationals.He added: “Any Brexit at this stage is likely to damage Aberdeen.“Democracy is to go to the people and ask for their views.”He was backed up by EU citizen and SNP councillor Christian Allard, a Frenchman who said he would not be willing to apply to live in Scotland – where he has made a le for  years.However, Douglas Lumsden, Conservative group leader and co-leader of the council, said councillors should take no action, adding they should be “more concerned by Mastrick and not Maastricht”. Mr Lumsden, who said he voted to remain in the EU referendum, added: “A total of .m people voted to leave the EU. For the sake of democracy it must be delivered and it will be delivered.”He added the motion was “absolutely pointless”, claiming a second referendum would be a “disaster for democracy”.Liberal Democrat group leader Ian Yuill said: “We now know that promises made about Brexit, like £ million a week extra for the NHS and getting a deal with the ‘exact same benefits’ as EU membership, cannot be kept.“Since the start of the month it has become blindingly clear that the Brexit process is a mess and the Prime Minister’s exit deal is clearly doomed.“A people’s vote would put the UK’s citizens back in control and give everyone the chance to decide whether the Prime Minister’s deal is good for the country andthe UK should leave the EU on those terms.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/ee-cr-111218-01-003.jpg-789x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet can you give one of these animals a new home dec15","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable animals from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home  vw, px\"  Lovely laidback ladies Ruby and Sophie are looking for a forever home together.The pair, who are  years old, still enjoy their walks but also like a sofa day too.Someone who is at home most of the time would be ideal for these girls, who are likely to follow their new owner around the home.The pooches, who are not suited to a household with children, will need to be kept on a hypoallergenic diet. vw, px\"  Gorgeous girl Freya is looking for a new owner who can take her on lots of country walks.The six-year-old, who has been neutered, has previously beem around children and will need an owner with experience of the breed.Freya is also used to other dogs but can can be quite vocal with them until she gets to know them.Can you give her a home  vw, px\"  Handsome lad Louie is on the prowl for a new home where he can get outdoors to explore.Although six-month-old Louie can be quite a feisty boy, he also adores receiving cuddles.And when it comes to playtime, this cute cat has lightning reflexes.It is not knownLouie has previously been around other animals or children.Can you give him a home Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"building a dream home for childrenhow to donate","story":"A north-east charity’s plans to create a specialist centre will involve a huge range of facilities to support families.Charlie House submitted planning permission to Aberdeen City Council for a site at Woodend Hospital where it hopes to build a specially-designed centre with eight bedrooms and accompanying family accommodation.The charity, which is based in Aberdeen, supports children with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions and their families.

The room can be decorated according to their child’s wishes, and will have access to a walled garden and adjacent lounge to ensure privacy.Tracy Johnstone, founder and chairwoman of Charlie House, said: “The centre will be a wonderful, welcoming and inclusive environment where the emphasis is on making memories. From making keepsakes and memory boxes in the craft room to enjoying time together as a family in the spacious sensory garden, Charlie House will be where precious memories are made and treasured for years to come.“It will be such a special and essential building in the Aberdeen landscape and, as a region, we should be proud to welcome this.”The centre – which the charity is currently trying to raise £ million to build and maintain – will encompass eight children’s bedroom suites, with accompanying family rooms.Children’s bedrooms will be decorated and furnished in complementary tones, with bedding and cushions which will reflect the child’s taste. Each room will be fully equipped, and will include full room hoisting and a iety of bed options, depending on the needs and age of the child.Charlie House is hoping to raise £ million for its Big Build Appeal, which will allow it to build and maintain the new centre.A whopping £m of the funds have already been secured through generous supporters.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

Clear it up as it happens or do something in the development plan to make sure it doesn’t in the future.Name and address supplied.What do you think about Lochgilphead and its future  Contact the Advertiser on editor@argyllshireadvertiser or message us directly via Facebook. Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

To be clear, funding for our core services is being cut again.#For Argyll and Bute this increases our estimated funding gap for next year to £ million.

The Scottish Government provides around  per cent of councils’ funding so another . per cent reduction will have signicant impact. It means we must focus on what we as a council have a duty to deliver, and reduce the work we do that’s additional to that.#We have to consider, unfortunately, even those services that are valued,they are not a statutory requirement.#Our priority will be as always to make the best possible use of whatever level of funding we receive, We must set our budget in February .

The combination of problems forced the family to live in the bedroom of their house where the damp was less severe.After seven months of negotiating, Gary and Lindsay have moved out of the house into a privately let property close to Oban.At the time ACHA chief executive Alastair McGregor said: ‘The association will provide compensation through our redress policy to Mr Smith for his inconvenience. The association is committed to getting this matter concluded as soon as possible and for Mr Smith and his family to enjoy the facilities in their new home in the very near future.’In a letter to Mr McGregor, Gary said: ‘I am disgusted the way me and my family have been treated. If this is what you call habitable condition I wouldn’t like to see what ACHA classes as inhabitable.’Since the Argyllshire Advertiser published the article, Gary maintains the holes in the side of the building have not been filled, the damp not dealt with, nor has black mould in the bedroom.He said: #When they got someone to look at it he just wanted to plaster over the problem. That won#t solve the damp in the whole house. I guarantee when we leave they#ll just plaster over it and give it to someone .#When asked about the family#s situation and lack of movement on it, Alastair McGregor said: #Once the current tenancy has ended, we will be investigating further to ensure the issues are completely resolved. With respect to the boreholes, this is not work that is incomplete. We are currently carrying out investigations and that is why they are open.#ACHA was not aware of any problems with the property at the point of letting and we would never knowingly let a property which was not wind and watertight.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a christmas thought for the week","story":"Marilyn SheddenUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis Sunday will be the fourth Sunday in Advent and it is traditionally the time for nativity plays.There are many stories of children ad-libbing and parents cringing as the youngsters make up their own words when they go #off script#.One of my favourites is about the wee boy who looked into the crib and said: #Isn#t he like his dad #The congregation laughed, as they knew these were not the scripted words – but had this wee boy not just got the gospel in a nutshell He had heard his mum say this of the new baby next door, so he thought it an appropriate thing to say.How right he was.#Isn#t he like his dad # Is this not the message of Christmas Of course, we do not know what Jesus looked like physically, but that doesn#t matter. #Isn#t he like his dad #Jesus came to show us what God was like and from the very beginning God set the stage of his nativity.Jesus was born in poverty, a refugee without a place to live, so his parents borrowed the lowliest of places – so the story goes.Jesus# birth and his le emphasise that God#s message was for the ordinary folk, those who were not important to the rich or the powerful, but who were important to God.As Jesus grew he made his home and his le with those the world rejected, with those the world despised because those were the ones who found special favour with God.Jesus came to bring God#s inclusive love to everyone and to love everyone in this wonderful kingdom.#Isn#t he just like his dad#.May God bless you at this very special time."},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre.

Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward.

ancient and modern.Initial plans by The Abbotsford Trust, to replace the old wood and repair the wrought ironwork on the gate, were revised when research by The Scottish Conservation Studio revealed the Portcullis Gate was not a mismatch of wood of ying quality as originally thought, but was in fact all original wood from Scottrsquos time.The project turned into one of conservation rather than replacement.Pippa Coles, Abbotsfordrsquos Gardens Heritage Development Manager, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to see the gate back in position and looking as Scott intended.\"Earlier this year, I read in John Smithrsquos diary that the gate had originally arrived on December , , so I felt it was a fitting date for their , and it was extra special that Keith, Johnrsquos descendant could join us.ldquoWe are very grateful to our funders and donors who made this important conservation project possible.\"We hope visitors to Abbotsford in the New Year, when we reopen in March, will enjoy walking through the grand entrance, just as Scottrsquos guests did nearly  years ago.The skilled restoration work was undertaken by Charles Taylor Woodwork, based in Dalkeith.The gates were removed last December, dried out and then dismantled and recorded before work began.The original wooden frame was badly damaged and has been replaced, while the internal lattice work has been restored by splicing in good wood from the old frame.Despite its name, the Portcullis Gate is hinged and not raised and dropped by a pulley system.It derives its name from its design, which references the style of a portcullis, an image of which is also carved above the gate.Scottrsquos use of this defensive symbol at the main entry to his home suggests that he viewed Abbotsford as a personal sanctuary.The portcullis image was also used by Scott on his personal book bindings in his library, where the symbol is accompanied by the Latin motto Clausus Tutus Ero , signalling Scottrsquos attitude to Abbotsford as a place of safety from the outside world.Due to its symbolic recurrence throughout Abbotsford, the Portcullis Gate is considered by many to be one of the homersquos most important features.It not only serves as an image of grandeur for guests arriving at Abbotsford, but also symbolises Scottrsquos intentions for Abbotsford as a place of retreat from the chaos of the outside world.The gate was so iconic that it was photographed by William Fox Talbot in October,  for his book The Sun Pictures of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"thea-and-thomas-are-the-most-popular-baby-names-in-the-borders","story":"BORDERS parents have gone against the grain when choosing baby names this year.The most popular choice for new-born girls in the region during the past  months is Thea -

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty.

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in.

We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in Tweeddale are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

Mrs Mayrsquos features are blank not because shersquos brave, but because she lacks either the courage or the will to change course and save the country from the catastrophe we all face.To be clear, this Remain-voting PM is either stupid enough to try and go ahead with a policy that even her own Government says will be massively damaging to the people of this country, or too cowardly to stop it. Which of these chilling realities is worse Like the robot she jokingly impersonated a few months ago at the Conservative Party conference, the Maybot keeps going through the motions of the disastrous, unsupportable deal she has cobbled together. But that joke isnrsquot funny anymore, especially as Mrs May must bear much of the responsibility for the impossible situation she has found herself in over the last weeks and months.:Flag expert: lsquoThe use of the Union Jack has never been so positive in ScotlandrsquoMake no mistake, this is not only a perfect storm but also a crisis of her own making. It was the PM, after all, who came up with the ill-conceived and wrong-headed red lines of the deal without consulting Parliament or even trying to build consensus and bring MPs with her. She has ignored the Scottish Parliamentrsquos objections and resisted every attempt at Westminster to give MPs a say in the process.Mrs May is not a person any of us, the poor so-and-sos who will suffer economically, socially and culturallyshe goes through with this folly, should feel sympathy for.At this crucial point I believe we should extend the hand of Christmas friendship to another isive figure, however: Tony Blair.The former PM has been embracing the sort of leadership and pragmatism Mrs May continues to reject by quietly chinning EU leaders behind the scenes, trying to hammer out a solution to the terrible situation we all find ourselves in. And, since hersquos intelligent and sane as well as extremely well connected, Mr Blair has come up with a sensible and cogent way forward. The catch is, of course, it would require the sort of leap of imagination the current PM seems incapable of.Instead of trying to keep flogging her dead horse, Mrs May should, according to her predecessor, become a facilitator for MPs to decide the next step. If no consensus can be found in Parliament, he justiably backs a public vote to determine whether Brexit should go ahead.Crucially, he also says the EU should ndash and would - make concessions on some of the issues that led to Brexit in the first place, such as free movement, thus allowing some EU doubters to come back into the fold and vote to cancel Brexit. Being seen to listen to concerns over immigration, to offer some flexibility to nation states, would surely be welcomed more widely across Europe, too.Showing uncharacteristic emotion, perhaps sensing hersquos on to something, Mrs May has angrily accused Mr Blair of undermining her talks. Predictably, the Corbyn faithful has also blown a gasket at his intervention Labourrsquos former leader remains the anti-Christ in their eyes because of his decision to involve Britain in the Iraq war.The whole lot of them need to move on, Labour from Iraq and the Tories from their calamitous belief that Brexit can and should happen. Lest we forget Mr Blair, though undoubtedly flawed, was the last politician able to gain the broad support of most people in Britain, regardless of their background or ideology.Hersquos the sort of pragmatic centrist the country is crying out for right now, and over the festive season Irsquoll be praying Mrs May has a Christmas epiphany and follows his lead."},{"url":null,"title":"12-things-to-do-in-scotland-to-get-even-the-grinch-into-the-christmas-spirit","story":".

And the most fervent hope of all at this darkest point in the calendar was probably simply that spring, and light, would .In these street-lit, centrally heated times, its hard to imagine how hard le must have been during long, dark months when even candles were scarce commodities and death from flu, starvation or hypothermia was never far away. The heart-felt yearning for light is reflected in the peculiar traditions that continue to be observed, albeit in a slightly dferent form, on Christmas Eve.Coming a few days after the winter solstice , December  isnt a public holiday, yet it contains more magic and portent than any of the festivals  official days.The cattle are lowingThe idea that marvellous things happen on this enchanted night is wonderfully evoked in Thomas Hardys poem, The Oxen.ldquoChristmas Eve, and  of the clock,Now they are all on their knees,An elder said as we sat in a flockBy the embers in hearthside ease.On any other day of the year, the poem continues, few would entertain the notion that a shed full of cattle might kneel down on the straw in an agrarian echo of the Nativity. But on this particular night, nobody doubts it andsomeone invited the poet to witness the scene, ldquoI should go with him in the gloom, Hoping it might be so.Those lines were written in , at a time when fear stalked every fireside and the longing for a miracle ndash the hope that ldquoit might be so ndash must have augmented the desire to believe in magic that descends at this time of year.An apparent manestation of the belief that animals take on human characteristics on Christmas Eve continues in Denmark, where its customary to go for a Christmas Eve walk equipped with treats for the animals you might meet: a throwbackto attempts to appease creatures that might otherwise speak ill of you on that enchanted night.Troll the ancient Yuletide carolAlmost certainly the precursor to the Christmas tree, the Yule logs origins are pre-medieval and believed to be linked to the sacred role of trees in Nordic paganism. Yule is the name of the winter solstice festivals once held across northern Europe .The log was cut down on the morning of the winter solsticeand brought into the house, though the fact its said to have been a whole tree trunk makes me wonderit was burned in a great hall or communal area rather than inidual homes. Its generally agreed that the log was ignited in the evening using a remnant of the previous years log, and according to some accounts, one end would be pushed into the fire and ceremonially burnt and the remainder fed in over the duration of the festive period. The remnants were then stored to protect the house against lightning and evil spirits, and to light the following years log. The ashes were thought to have magical and medicinal qualities.The practice continues north of the Border, where, according the Pagan Federation Scotland: ldquoWe celebrate the rebirth of the sun, often by burning a specially chosen log through the long hours of darkness, kindled from the remains of the previous years Yule-fire.One account of the old ritual holds that on Christmas Eve, the youngest person present would light two candles from the burning Yule log, then everyone would make a wish for the coming year. You might want to close your eyesfollowing this tradition, since its said thatthe shadows cast by the blazing log appear to be headless, death will come calling in the months to come.The holly and the ivyIf your mantelpiece is already festooned with holly, ivy and mistletoe, then Im sorry to dampen the mood but its supposed to be unlucky to bring greenery into the house until Christmas Eve. Be of good cheer, though: the winter foliage tradition is probably older than Christianity, which means December  is an arbitrary date so far as Yuletide spirits are concerned.At one time, holly was grown near homes in the hope that witches and evil spirits would be trapped in its dense, prickly foliage. The plant ndash and its festive partner, ivy ndash were associated with fertility: holly was male, ivy female and the leaves were burnt together at the pagan festival of Beltane, presumably in order to promote fecundity and a bounteous harvest the following year.During some winter festivals, a young girl clothed in ivy would parade around the village with a holly-clad boy, in order to bring le and fertility to the darkest time of the year.Blame it on the mistletoeThis parasitical plant remains green after the host tree has become bare and apparently leless, which may explain the ancient belief in its magical properties: druids would cut it from oak trees using a golden sickle for use in rituals and medicine.Legend has it that mistletoe was once a tree in its own right. One story holds that Jesuss cross was made of mistletoe wood and the plant was condemned to become the shrunken, parasitic sprig we know today. In Norse mythology, Baldur ndash god of the summer sun ndash was killed by an arrow made from mistletoe, thus ushering winter into the world.Seasonal spiritsPerhaps inevitably, given the scarcity of daylight and the proximity of death during pre-antibiotic winters, some of the magic associated with this time of year is dark and restless. Spirits were long thought to have walked the Earth on Christmas Eve, as Ebenezer Scrooge discovered to his perturbation. In fact, the tradition of telling ghost stories on that night predated Charles Dickenss A Christmas Carol, though the previously oral custom seems to have boosted by the growth of periodical publication in the th century.Henry Jamess famous  chiller, The Turn Of The Screw, also opens on Christmas Eve with the telling of strange tales around a hearth, and the medieval historian and author MR James continued the tradition into the th century, reading spine-prickling stories aloud each Christmas Eve to friends gathered around the fireside in his rooms in Kings College, Cambridge.Why such tales should be associated with December  is open to speculation but theirwas guessed at by the American author Keith Lee Morris. Writing about seasonal ghost stories three years ago, he suggested that however spooky the tale, its ldquonot nearly as horrying as the events that real le holds in store for us. Scaring ourselves with fiction is, therefore, a distraction from our anxieties and a way of confronting our demons in a safe and homely environment. Obliquely, therefore, the ghost story acts, once again, as a kind of wish: a hope against hope that the real ghouls of illness, death and grief wont come knocking on our doors.Twas the night before Christmas hellipChristmas Eves most popular wandering spirit is, of course, Santa Claus, who on this night has been estimatedto travel some  million miles, a feat that is reckoned to require his reindeer to move at around five million miles per hour heaving their not inconsiderable burden, particularly as the jolly old elf is likely to have consumed  billion calories worth of mince pies along the way.The legend of Father Christmas has deep roots and worldwide there are plenty of stories of benevolent figures who go around distributing gts, particularly to children. My favourite is the Russian legend of Babushka, who was racked with remorse after failing to guide the Three Kings to the place of Christs birth and now gives gts to sleeping babies and children in the forlorn hope that one of them will be the baby Jesus, and that she will be forgiven.Im not sure of the authenticity of this version of the story, but its emphasis on the human desire for atonement is echoed by Ebenezer Scrooges yearning for redemption following his Christmas Eve tour of his past sins.The Spirit Of Christmas Present in Dickenss tale ndash clothed in green robes and surrounded by holly, ivy and mistletoe ndash bears a resemblance to the Father Christmas of legend, who himself may have been a throwback to the Green Man, probably a pagan fertility figure celebrated as a harbinger of spring. In parts of the British Isles in the middle of the first millennium, someone dressed up as King Winter would be welcomed into peoples homes and offered refreshment in the hope hed reward his hosts with a mild season.Todays Santa seems to be an amalgamation of all those characters, the Norse god Odin and St Nicholas, a kindly third-century bishop from Turkey said to have distributed gts to relieve want and suffering. Most famously, he showered gold coins down the chimney of a poor man in order to save his dowry-less daughters from spinsterhood or prostitution, depending on which version of the story you believe. Whatever the rationale, those coins landed in stockings that were drying by the fire, precursors to the socks todays children hang up on Christmas Eve, to be filled with toys by Santa.Mr Clauss red suit is often said to originate from a s Coca Cola advert, and while its possible hed been depicted in similar dress before then, it seems clear that his nocturnal schedule on December  is largely the product of American imagination, since most of the details ndash from the reindeer-driven sleigh to the chubby gents propensity for laughter ndash stem from the poem A Visit From St Nicholas, which was published anonymously in New Yorks Troy Sentinel in  and later attributed to Clement Clarke Moore .ldquoTwas the night before Christmas, begins the old rhyme, and Clarke Mooresaccount remains the orthodox version of the events that will fill childrens heads this Monday night as they lie awake, convincing themselves they can hear reindeer hooves and imagining the wonders theyll find beneath the tree in the morning.Peace on EarthFar from Hardys hearth, the Western Front would have been saturated with yearning. As December  approached, young men on both sides of No Mans Land must have wished desperately to be at home with their loved ones instead of huddled in freezing trenches, waiting anxiously for the orders that might catapult them them towards horror and death.The previous year, Christmas Eve truces had famously taken place on the night of December , , when British, French and German soldiers crossed into No Mans Land to exchange greetings, cigarettes and chocolate. Although this memory has undoubtedly been romanticised, it seems clear that truces did take place, that football matches happened, and that the miracle of peace was delivered by frightened, homesick young men who must have been starkly aware of the nonsensical nature of their situation, knowing that the friendships theyd forged would shortly be obliterated by gunfire.By the time Christmas Eve, , came around, orders had been dispatched that such behaviour wouldnt be tolerated. A few subversive truces took place, nonetheless, but for the most part, the Front Line would have been a cold and lonely place where the wish to be anywhere but in those godforsaken trenches was profound.The hopes and fears of all the yearsThe truth, of course, is that the hands stuffing stockings and wrapping presents will be human and the job of realising the wishes that have been planted in childrens heads via slick commercials falls to parents, whose own Christmas Eve hope is often simply that their offering will be greeted by joy, and not disappointment.The pressure to make dreams come true is ferocious. Evenyou dont have young children, theres plenty of scope for self-flagellation in the pursuit of the ultimate feast.Then there is the pressure to create the atmosphere of domestic conviviality encountered by the penitent Scrooge in the parlour of his nephew, Fred. Alternatively, we could all remind ourselves that our distant ancestors most ardent wishes appear to have revolved around the simple desire, on the darkest of days, for aof the climatic conditions needed to feed and care for their families and communities.This coming Monday, there will be plenty of people doing their best to keep the spirit of hope alive across Scotland in hospitals, food banks and homeless shelters. Such organisations will be recipients of the collections gathered in watch-night masses and church services where, as the clock approaches midnight, people will sing carols full of hope.Those songs have particular resonance for Christians, of course, but they also speak to people of dferent faiths and none about the desire for light in the darkness, and the wish for kindness to transcend selfishness and greed.In Frank Capras Its A Wonderful Le, perhaps the th centurys most familiar secular expression of that message, the communitys triumph over aicious capitalism is expressed in their Christmas Eve rendition of Hark The Herald Angels Sing.But the carol that evokes most clearly the universal longing for light is surely the one about the distant town of Bethlehem, above whose ldquodeep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by. Its final lines, about ldquothe hopes and fears of all the years, reminds us of the common thread that unites us with all the inhabitants of dferent continents and epochs, who have ever gazed in wonder at the night sky.Think of that as you make your wish this Christmas Eve."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-i-didnt-bother-with-a-christmas-treeand-now-i-regret-it","story":"I enjoy it while itrsquos here, as the scent of sophisticated masculinity is rare in both this rural corner and my house in particular.And it somehow brings an energy into the rooms ndash an energy lacking in an all too silent home.He arrived for a pre-Christmas weekend as I canrsquot, or, as he sees it, wonrsquot fly to London.This upsets and annoys him in equal measure.

Time for him to get tough.Ms Sturgeons reference to nationalisation, meanwhile, went further than stated SNP policy.In its  Holyrood manesto, the SNP said the party would merely ensure a public sector body was able to bid for a future rail contract, when the franchise lapsed.While in last yearrsquos general election manesto, the SNP said its MPs would argue for the devolution of Network Rail to get ldquoa more effective and efficient rail service.Nor is there a reference to rail nationalisation in the  White Paper on Independence.That said that once the current ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper franchises ran out, the government of an independent Scotland would, ldquounder existing European legislation, have the opportunity to consider all options for the delivery of passenger services, including public sector options, but it did not identy nationalisation as one of those options.That was despite stating the Royal Mail would be renationalised after independence.SNP MSPs also voted against a Labour motion backing nationalisation just last month.Scotlandrsquos railways were last fully in public hands more than  years ago.State-owned British Rail ran them from  to .A gradual Tory privatisation then began in  that transferred them to the private sector by .Mr Sturgeonrsquos comment came after she was pressed by the Scottish Tories about the current misery on Scotlandrsquos railways as a result of hundreds of ScotRail cancellations.Acting Tory leader Jackson Carlaw said punctuality was at its worst for  years, there were staff shortages due to training for a winter timetable, and delayed rolling stock.Askedtrain passengers were owed an apology, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoYes, I do. ScotRail has made it clear that it regrets the cancellations and delays that have been caused. Let me be perfectly clear: the level of cancellations - this week, in particular - has been unacceptable.She said ScotRail caused  cancellations on Monday and around  on Thursday.Mr Carlaw said new official figures showed around  cancellations or partial cancellations a year ldquocaused entirely by ScotRail, despite ministers telling ScotRail to improve.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoProgress is being made but it is not good enough.Mr Carlaw said Ms Sturgeon needed to ensure a train network ldquofit for purpose in .Ms Sturgeonrsquos spokesman was later unable to say what rail nationalisation might cost.He said: ldquoOur position is to pursue a public sector bid. We donrsquot have those [nationalisation] powers.

Most delays to passengers are caused by publicly-owned Network Rail. Ownership is not the silver bullet that our politicians think it is.ldquoInstead of stating a publicly owned railway would be automatically superior, they should explain what practical measures it would take that the current operator is not.

Network Rail is a UK public body and, although its activities in Scotland are specied and funded by the Scottish Government, it is ultimately accountable to the UK Government.ldquoFor the recently announced UK rail review to be meaningful, it must consider devolving all rail matters to the Scottish Ministers.

The word Unionist is included in the full title of their party and the historic privileges enjoyed by them and the cultural constituency they represented have all indeed flourished when Westminsterrsquos writ has run in its four constituent parts.This is not to say that they are anything less than fully Scottish, just that they believe Scotlandrsquos destiny to be forever entwined with the UK. Itrsquos merely one among many declarations of what it means to be Scottish and none the less valid for that and is characterised chiefly by an historic affectionnot love for what they understand Britishness to be.Thus, there was an honesty and integrity about the Scottish Toriesrsquo opposition to independence that was absent in much of the campaigning of Scottish Labour chiefs and their water-carriers on social media. This seemed to be fuelled less by any great love for the Union than by an implacable malevolence ndash sometimes approaching outright hatred ndash towards anything sponsored by the SNP. At times you formed an impression thatScottish independence was being proposed by wee green men emerging from a spaceship they would receive a fairer hearing in some Labour circles than anyone sporting a yellow and black rosette.The seeds of such bitterness were probably sewn in hundreds of Westminster and electoral campaigns keenly contested and with a signicant degree of rancour with the SNP. On these occasions it wasnrsquot the Tories who were threatening their influence and privileges but the SNP, even though they may have shared largely similar social agendas. Many simply couldnrsquot stomach the possibility of permitting what would be the ultimate triumph of the SNP evenit meant ignoring what their instincts were telling them: that Westminster was beginning to favour options for the rich in its economic policies and to re-direct any resultant working-class bitterness in the direction of immigrants.Even the most reactionary of Tory governments come to power on the back of working class votes. For this to occur, they must always have an assortment of familiar phantoms and usual suspects to hand and these must be leveraged by calls to national unity and security or the echoes of empire. Any notions Scottish Labour might have entertained about de-coupling from such a polity were swamped by antagonism towards the wretched SNP. They also fashioned a  narrative to conceal such narrow animosity. Thus, the lie that the referendum was nasty and isive and that Yes supporters despised the English became the distinguishing feature of their campaign.It was probably this, as much as anything , that formed the tipping point for many Labour supporters who, having signalled their rejection of such a dishonest narrative, were subsequently marginalised and made to feel like aliens in their own party. None of them have since ed to the Labour fold and this, more than anything  is why Labour in Scotland is a spent force with no immediate prospect of recovery.Foolishly, Richard Leonard, Labourrsquos latest leader in Scotland, continues to oppose independence while exhibiting no shred of original thinking on policy that might make his party attractive once more to the tens of thousands of its former supporters who have abandoned it.As Westminster takes a two-week holiday while the clock ticks towards a No-deal Brexit nothing in the behaviour of Labourrsquos UK leadership has done anything to inspire confidence either. In the last seven days Irsquove asked several Labour supporters to describe their partyrsquos Brexit strategy. No two answers were the same and all were marked by confusion. Any empathy they had previously felt with Jeremy Corbynrsquos policies on social justice has evaporated, largely on the perception that he has been found grievously wanting on this the biggest political issue of their lives. No leadership, no consistency, no courage and no conviction are the unorm verdict of Mr Corbynrsquos lamentable last two weeks at Westminster. By contrast, Theresa May, even in these her darkest dayshas displayed all of these attributes.The spectre of a No-deal Brexit now looms large and with it the real threat, which the UK Government has now admitted, of civil disorder. These and the exposure of Mr Corbynrsquos failure of leadership will test the propaganda unit of the Better Together campaign during the second referendum on Scottish independence.Once, it might have been a valid argument to insist that in a time of national crisis we must pull in the same direction. Butyou have been ignored and treated with contempt as Scotlandrsquos Government and Scotlandrsquos parliament have been in their efforts to help get a decent Brexit or even to mitigate its worst effects then such appeals are rendered worthless and hollow.In  Westminsterrsquos lurch towards reactionary and socially isive policies tipped many of us towards an independent Scotland.

Democratic president Bill Clinton, after the congressional midterm drubbing for his party, was dealing with the new world order.After five days, a deal was reached to end the shutdown, but only for a few weeks so that negotiations could take place on the ious spending bills funding the government for the remainder of the fiscal year.

An estimated , federal workers were furloughed. They eventually agreed to spending plans that enacted some of the cuts Republicans wanted, though less than they had originally sought.Republicans took a political hit for the shutdown, which closed national parks and Smithsonian museums.Undercutting the Republicans was Mr Gingrichrsquos comment that the hard-line stance in negotiations was due in part to how Mr Clinton and aides treated him and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole on an Air Force One flight.Mr Gingrich complained that Mr Clinton did not discuss the budget on thetrip from Israel, where they had attended the funeral of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. Mr Gingrich also complained about having to exit through a back door on the plane.October -, Republicans who controlled the House and several Republican senators targeted Democratic president Barack Obamarsquos healthcare law.

The deal was largely unpopular among Democratic voters, who blamed their representatives for caving in too easily.February , Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky single-handedly triggered the shortest shutdown in history with a filibuster that forced the Senate to miss a midnight deadline to approve a spending deal that Mr Paul regarded as wasteful.As a result, the government technically ran out of money at .am that Friday.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting.

The appeal ends at the end of the year.Donations forms have been published in The Orcadian over the appeal, with donations also accepted online at: www.gofundme longhope-leboat-museumThe trust can also be contacted via email: longhope@gmailcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Incredibly, the pound target was smashed within days, hundreds of complete strangers inspired by his determination amongst the backers.Speaking to the Ross-shire Journal this week, he said: \"Since getting access to the best facilities and coaches, my performance has improved and Im getting personal bests. Cycling in front of a home crowd in London was just so much fun ndash the noise was ridiculous and I just didnt want to come off the track.\"He powered through the km four-lap race in m s, pipped by just a fraction of a second by the reigning world champion.Fin, who needs a leg brace to race, was quick to thank those who have shown faith in him, not least parents Dee and Drew who have backed his dream from the start and driven him thousands of miles around the country to compete. \"Without them, none of this would have happened,\" he said. \"They were able to come down to London to watch, which was very special.\"After being invited to talk to pupils at his former school, Fin said he shared his highs and lows and spoke of the importance of setting a target ndash even amidst setbacks such as his illness.A spokesman at Dingwall Academy said: \"Effort, resilience, embracing challenge, listening to feedback, never giving up and learning from failures were all great messages.\"His mum Dee, a childrens nurse, earlier told the Journal: \"We have no idea what the future holds.

This is a month noted for its joie de vivre, bonhomie and what the German language, with typical economy, calls Weinachteneinkäuferwartung . It is signicant, perhaps, that the English language has no specic noun for the state of mind that settles on many of us during this special month. This state is marked by a niggling desire to get away – anywhere – in order to escape the state of mind that appears to affecting others.For some, the first appearance of Christmas lights is the signal that things are about to go downhill. In Edinburgh, this happens now in September, immediately after the Edinburgh Festival. This is in accordance with the desire of our local tourism promoters – a couthie lot – to inflict festivals on the long-suffering inhabitants of this city  , as the expression has it, and, indeed,  . For this, many feel they should be awarded  . But that is another subject, and it is too depressing to talk about it in a month during which we are all so spontaneously cheerful. The Reverend I.M. Jolly we most certainly are not.However, one feature of December that is genuinely enjoyable is the Christmas letter that people like to send their friends and relatives round about now. These are wonderful things to receive, and who does not feel a certain disappointment when they open a Christmas card and find that it contains nothing but good wishes for Christmas and the New Year  There is no point in sending others such thin fare: of course they have such wishes for you, and it would be odd,not actually hurtful,they were not to harbour such thoughts. By contrast, finding a cyclostyled letter within is a bonus, and sets the heart racing with anticipation.: Alexander McCall Smith: Edinburgh Airport should charge people to sit downAn important thing to understand about these letters is that they give an opportunity to boast, usually about one’s offspring. Usually this involves exam results, which form, on average, about half the content of a Christmas letter. When it comes to Highers and A levels and such things, people have no shame in trumpeting them loudly in the seasonal letter. Indeed, I have heard that the SQA, which controls exam results, is seriously thinking of withholding their release until December each year in order to ensure their topicality for Christmas letters. This is a helpful suggestion, although it may complicate university admission, which of course is another very fitting topic for the Christmas letter.What you should do in this respect is mention exam results indirectly. Don’t say Jane got nine As in her exams this year. That is clearly boastful and in bad taste. Rather, you should write, “Janeis still a bit worried about her university admission. I have assured her that anyone who gets nineA grades in her Advanced Highers has no need to worry, but does she listen to me  You know how children are!” Other family achievements should not be forgotten, and should all be referred to in a good Christmas letter. Once again, insert the information indirectly, as in this example: “We all went to Rome this year and had a wonderful time. The Pope looks so much younger, you know, when you see him close up. I mean, really close up, in his private study.” That conveys, in a very tactful way, the message you wish to convey. Then you might add, “We were a bit nervous of course, as this is the first time that we have had a direct experience of the beatication of a close relative . But it was such a simple, rather moving ceremony and we had a lovely dinner afterwards in a modest trattoria ...”: Alexander McCall Smith: Time to wake up and smell Europa’s coffee If you received an OBE or similar award this year, do not mention it directly. The following form of words will suffice: “We couldn’t get away in July, as planned, as I had to go down to London– just for the morning – what a bind!” If you went to the Garden Party, then the only way of conveying that information is to say something like this: “My goodness, it was a battle getting into my morning suitin July. There I was enjoying my statutory cucumber sandwich under the gaze of Arthur’s Seat, thinking of the strict diet ahead!” No more than that is necessary.All heavy colds and injuries must be mentioned. The attachment of a small photograph of an X-ray plate is optional. That, believe it or not, really was in a Christmas letter we received a few years ago. The fracture was an interesting one.

But he also reserved time for a thinly-veiled critique of the  SNP MPs at Westminster.: Would an independent Scotland face a hard border with England In conclusion to a maritime-themed analogy, in which he described Mrs May as “a barnacle clinging desperately to the hull”, Mr Salmond said: “Even the Scottish contingent seems unsure as to when, or even whether, to launch our Caledonian leboat and chart our own course for the continent.”“In fact, the only parliamentmentary group which appears secure and determined in their objectives are the Democratic Unionists. Speaking in the show’s closing monologe, Mr Salmond added: “Parliament should now take advantage of the Scottish ruling from the European Court of Justice and instruct the Government to revoke Article . This would allow the time and space for either a general election or a renewed referendum, or even just a rationale discussion to break the deadlock and chart a way forward, free from the looming clf edge. As we say in Scotland - that would make for a guid new year.”An SNP spokesman said: “The fact of the matter is this – an alternative must be found to the PM’s  choice of a bad deal which lacks support, or a bad deal which would spell disaster for jobs and living standards.“The SNP is the only party showing true leadership by knocking heads together and making the case for a better way forward.“Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in Europe. If we have the chance to do so through another EU referendum we should grasp that opportunity.“But there is no doubt whatsoever that the utter chaos of Brexit from the Tory party has strengthened the case for Scotland taking its future into its own hands through independence.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Give us a vote and I will vote with my head and my heart for Shetland to be clear of da lot a dem, EU, UK and Scotland all running massive deficits. We wid certainly be much better aff.Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come. Maybe try to get over it Mr. Shetland-wid-be-much-better-aff-clear-of-da-lot-of-dem, EU-UK-and-Scotland.I do not know exactly what it is Peter, but your first paragraph reminds me of ##.. Is not worth noticing. lolHo ho ho! Glad you are laughing David 🙂I’m with you on the real agenda behind Brexit not being immediately obvious btw.I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.They don’t need the EU to guarantee their human rights. They have holidays aplenty and investments in so many places that using the NHS is as alien to them as using public transport.They have uncharitably driven their agenda to the fore against the better instincts of one nation Tories and have done so using decades of media manipulation and dispicable xenophobic dog whistle messages on immigration.Thankfully as I write the Shaddow Home Secretary is advocating for an “efficient, fair and non-discriminatory migration policy” that is conducive to the UK’s economic interests. Something to wish for in the New Year.I take your points, Peter. It will be interesting how the Tories will drive their immigration policies and whether or not it bends more towards the USA than to this of the EU, after March next year One of the largest industries which depend on EU workers is in the hospitality industry, even here in Shetland there is a large EU workforce, not only in the hospitality industry, but the fishing processing industry as well.It will be interesting how the Shetland economy will cope after March .As for human rights, I question the validity of as to what will be used and what will be discarded in terms of either British or European Human Rights. I fear workers rights may be diminished and favoured more towards the employer than the employee     We shall see If the UK becomes # the cheap workforce of Europe # this may stir up resentment within the working ethos or political change##.before it is too late    We are in unchartered waters, and there could be stormy sea#s ahead. I just hope the changes are for the better of the collective rather than for the few    #I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.# O dear dear me, it is all a wicked capitalist conspiracy.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Aimee-Fewell-4-Auchtertyre-primry.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated. The work includes a new social area and ICT room, plus innovative youth mental health rooms for the Flare Project.Work began to transform the centre in March, with some staff working out of the Waveney Youth Centre, and young people only being able to use a small section of the building.From June of this year the centre has been closed to facilitate the refurbishment, therefore young people and staff were really looking forward to getting back to the building.Many young people rely on the youth centre on a daily basis.Running clubs and activities five nights of the week, around  youths use the facilities. Monday and Friday nights are for nine to twelve year olds, while Tuesday and Thursdays are the senior nights for teenagers.On Wednesday the centre is available for all on their split night.Run by the Education Authority Youth Service, the centre is a valued part of the community and provides important le skill training for young people, as well as providing them with activities. It features a youth leadership project and has a youth committee.Amie Mott, centre based youth worker for the Education Authority told theeveryone was excited for the opening.She said: The refurbishment is really lovely, and was greatly needed.“The young people have been using this building for  years so the enhancement was definitely needed.“In fact, some of the young people who are currently using the centre have told us their parents actually used it years ago, so in a lot of cases we are actually working with the second generation of Ballykeel young people!”Amie concluded by stressing the imporance and relevance of the centre to the community.She said: This is an important facility in the heart of Ballykeel, and we hope the new facilities will encourage even more young people to use the building.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list. Rea also finished runner up in the  BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Jonathan Rea with his honorary degree from the University of Ulster at Belfasts Waterfront Hall“These others awards and occasions are new to me.

Jonathan Reas specially made suit for the ceremony“My grades at GCSE were A*s, As and Bs, but unfortunately I didn’t further that. I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena. Asked where he came from, he said: “I’m a country boy. I grew up in Kilwaughter, then moved to Ballyboley. We were part of Larne Council with a Ballymena area code and a Ballyclare postcode. I’m happy to be claimed by whoever.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8741643.1545039707!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"Age NI says a recently launched Department of Health review of emergency health care # with a particular focus on pensioners # is #a bit late in the day# for this winter and #should have started months ago#.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

This was clearly a planned enterprise and you brazenly went back twice more. “An examination of your record reveals the courts have exhausted community based sentences. I want this sentence to be a deterrent to others.“A local business was targeted and as a result of this pre-planning, there has been a loss of thousands of pounds to the insurance company and the hard working businessman.“You have hope for the future as does the businessman who had his property stolen.

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dups emma pengelly reminds academic she has arts degree from ulster university","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

More than , American soldiers have died in Afghanistan since the  invasion.A Taliban official said the announcement is a positive step which could “lead to trust building that the US wants a political solution”.But there is no sign the Taliban are ready to move on the two major sticking points: Direct talks with the Afghan government and a ceasefire while the two sides negotiate Mr Khalilzad’s so-called “roadmap for the future of Afghanistan”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Zalmay Khalilzad has been trying to reach a peace settlement in Afghanistan Peace talks aside, the announced withdrawal has Afghan generals and analysts worried about the ability of the beleaguered Afghan National Afghan Security Force to stave off a Taliban insurgency unfettered by US troops and their pounding air power.The Taliban are already stronger today than they have been since they were ousted in , controlling or holding sway over nearly half the country.Several high ranking Afghan military officials said the morale of Afghanistan’s under-trained and poorly equipped security forces is already at a dangerously low ebb.

Transportation Security Administration officers will continue to staff airport checkpoints and air traffic controllers will also remain at work.Mr Trump has openly savoured a shutdown over the wall for months, saying last week he would be “proud” to have one and saying on Friday he was “totally prepared for a very long” closure. While many of Congress’ most conservative Republicans were welcoming such a confrontation, most Republican politicians have wanted to avoid one, since polling shows the public broadly opposes the wall and a shutdown over it.A design of our Steel Slat Barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautul! pic sGltXhcu— Donald J.

couple give christmas gift nurses helped save twin babies lives","story":"Two little Derry twins have delivered an early Christmas present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a kettle and a toaster.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

babies in their care.”The couple gave the nurses a voucher for a fridge freezer, cups, plates, cutlery, glasses a George Foreman grill, a set of knives, a radio and a £ MS voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

It has also a topic of considerable concern and a high profile environmental issue.Members of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee were told on Monday night that flytipping places a ldquosignicant demand on the organisationrsquos budget with staff also erted away from other duties to deal with the problem.Council officials are currently working alongside Environment Agency staff and neighbouring local authorities in what is being described as an attempt to ldquoadopt compatible practices and approaches to highlight the issue and reduce the scale of the problem.If the amount of the waste dumped mdash mostly in secluded areas mdash is greater than two cubic metres, or is hazardous, the incident is reported to the government agency. Council enforcement officers will also investigate each incident and assessthe culprits can be identied and prosecuted.On Monday night, councillors were told that over the past eight months there have been almost  reported fly tipping incidents across the district.Council staff responded to  incidents, with contractors removing waste on  occasions. Environment Agency staff removed waste on  occasions.While the cost of removing waste over the past eight months is estimated at almost pound,, council officials have suggested the yearly total could top the pound, mark.The cost of flytipping on hard pressed ratepayers comes just a few weeks after council officials were asked to look at innovative ways of combating the problem.Councillors are concerned about the scale of the issue and the restrictions being placed on what material ratepayers can dump at household recycling centres.Some elected representatives have suggested council officials should reintroduce a service used by the former Down Council which arranged for a local authority bin lorry to visit some towns and villages on a Saturday morning to allow people to get rid of their household waste.The scheme proved extremely popular and while it was in service there were few reported flytipping incidents in the area.In addition, community groups helped keep their respective towns and villages clean by taking part in litter picks, with their efforts recognised by the local authority via an awards scheme.Councillors also believe the fact that some of the districtrsquos household recycling centres do not accept certain types of waste is contributing to the scale of the flytipping issue which, they say, must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 19%2C 1978  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastlersquos status as a leboat base could be thrown on the rocks were sunk yesterday by the Royal National Leboat Institutionrsquos chief spokesman in Ireland, Lt-Col Brian Clark.In a clear-cut statement he dashed the hopes of  Kilkeel fishermen who have called for a full-scale rescue centre to be set up in their port instead of Newcastle.Lt-Col Clark, who is the RNLIrsquos organising secretary for all of Ireland, has also hit out strongly at claims that the prospect of a tug-orsquo-war situation is looming between Newcastle and Kilkeel.He said: ldquoKilkeel has indeed been considered carefully as a possible location for a leboat, but the major requirement is that a boat must be able to get away from its base promptly in all kinds of weather.ldquoThe RNLI management committee feels that this capability is at present lacking in the case of Kilkeel where strong winds create unfavourable conditions at the entrance to the new harbour. These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat.

Owner, Patsy Tweedie, of Mullamore Drive, thinks he is dead.Teddy, who featured on the Recorderrsquos front page in February, hasnrsquot been around his home for over two weeks and this makes Mr Tweedie almost certain he is dead.ldquoTeddy had been running around with a bitch recently and came him peppered with pellets just before he disappeared, Mr Tweedie said. ldquoThat makes me believe he has been shot by some farmer who thought he was worrying sheep.ldquoIf that is the case I feel the farmer has made a mistake. Teddy wouldnrsquot worry sheep. He was far more interested in carrying my sonrsquos bag home from school and things like that. He was well known in the village and senior citizens were often thankful to have him around as a sort of watch dog.Mr Tweedie said there had been several cases of sheep worrying in the district recently and thatrsquos what led him to believe that a farmer may have shot him.He added: ldquoWe certainly miss him.

Because of ill health, she has to crawl up to her bedroom on hands and knees and get back down on hands and knees.Spearheading the Watsonsrsquo case has been their daughter, Mrs Jean Cheevers, and after a long struggle she has finally managed to get good news for her parents.After bringing her case to the attention of the local MP, Mr Enoch Powell, Mr Gerry Fitt MP, Cllr Rowan-Hamilton, the Sunday News and the Down Recorder, she has at last evoked a reaction from the Housing Executive.The Executive has now decided to take a ldquohumanitarian attitude to the couplersquos case, therefore increasing their chances of getting a stair-free home.In a sympathetic letter to Mrs Cheevers, an Executive spokesman explained that full consideration had been given to the age and state of health of Mr and Mrs Watson.ldquoI should add that our ability to rehouse your parents in accommodation suitable to their needs will be dependent on such accommodation becoming available in the area, the spokesman added.DOWNPATRICK mdash A bumper medieval pageant proposed for Downpatrick in May to celebrate St Patrick is hanging in the balance mdash and only a large turnout at a public meeting early in the New Year can save it from the chop.The pageant, the brainchild of Down Councilrsquos arts committee, is seen to be one of the best ideas to come out of the district for some time mdash but unless sufficient backing is forthcoming, then the community festival will have to be scrubbed.Organisers have been guaranteed funds from Down Council, but in order to quality for a big payout by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will have to have the potential to be a major tourist attraction and to be continued each year.Mr Frank Connolly, a spokesman for the arts committee told the Recorder: ldquoIf there is no support, there will be no festival, itrsquos as simple as that. Wersquore calling a public meeting for January  in the new library in Downpatrick and itrsquos essential that there is a massive turnout of interested people and of organisations who are willing to play a part.ldquoA successful event would no doubt help tourism and itrsquos in the interest of the district to give it their full support.BALLYGOWAN mdash A young handicapped Ballygowan boy received an extra Christmas surprise recently when his pet donkey gave birth to a baby foal.Seven year-old Gregory Townley suffers from spina bida but the new addition to the family is certain to add an extra sparkle to Christmas for him.His mother, Mrs Myrtle Townley, said: ldquoMy husband got a donkey for Gregory two years ago after he bought a motorbike for my nine year-old son Roy.

When the borders came down there was a great sense of freedom, he said.He painted a bleak picture for farmers and industry stating that the UK have half of the European flock of ewes and that there was ldquono other market for sheep farmers and that a no deal Brexit would see the industry ldquofall off a clf.Father Joe McVeigh told the meeting that he was ldquovery concerned about the potential impact that Brexit would have on people on the Border. He said he did not want to see a ldquo to the bad old days of checkpoints.Councillor Alex Baird, UUP, stated that he had voted remain in the referendum but said he found there was a ldquopolitical connotation to the Border Communities Against Brexit group and that as a unionist he felt that there had been a ldquoparty political element brought in to the discussion by the lobby group.Councillor Raymond Farrell commented that ldquohe was no fan of the EU and quoted Pope Francis in saying that ldquothe EU was in danger of losing direction. He asked Mr. Sheridan how sending poundm to Europe a week and getting just over poundm back was ldquogood economics.Mr. Sheridan replied by saying ldquowe could argue about figures all day but that it was ldquoa fact that Northern Ireland received pound. for every pound that went out.

The European Commission has set out plans for  areas most likely to be impactedthe UK leaves the bloc without a deal, but the Irish border was notably absent from the list.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his government has made no preparations whatsoever for a hard borderDublin has also published a -page ‘Getting Ireland Brexit Ready’ document outlining back up plans for almost  sectors.But again, crucially, the dossier made no mention of how the Republic plans to address the Irish border issue post-Brexit.The paper says the government’s main focus is to prevent the emergence of a hard border on the island of Ireland, though it does not specy how that will be preventedthe prime minister’s withdrawal agreement is rejected by Parliament.DUP Westminster leader Mr Dodds said the fact that the border issue had been omitted from the plans demonstrated that, in the event of a no-deal scenario, a hard border will not come to pass.His remarks came hours before Irish Premier Leo Varadkar said that his government has made “no preparations whatsoever” for a hard border on the island.Despite the looming possibility of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Varadkar said he felt thathis government made plans to facilitate a hard border it would become a “self-fulfilling prophecy”.He insisted that Dublin was not preparing for a hard border nor was it planning to introduce any sort of physical infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic.And he said the best way to avoid a hard Brexit is for Parliament to implement Theresa May’s draft withdrawal deal.The threat of a hard border is the main justication for the EU’s proposed backstop, which aims to keep NI in the EU customs union after Brexit, but which unionists fear will weaken the Union.Mr Dodds said the notion that it is necessary to have checks in the Irish Sea to avoid a hard border between NI and the Irish Republic is an “utter con trick”. The North Belfast MP added that the EU’s back up plans “totally avoid spelling out” what happens on the border, adding: “What does that tell you  Even in the event of a so-called no-deal scenario a hard border won’t happen.Gatwick drone chaos could have been avoided, says NI expertMan taken to hospital after incident in N.I. forest Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Even the Dublin authorities in its no-deal plans admitted no checks on goods at the border. “The utter hypocrisy of those espousing the current withdrawal agreement with its trap of a backstop has been completely exposed.”Asked by the News Letter this week, the EU did not explicitly say who might be responsible for building physical infrastructure at the border. But TUV leader Jim Allister has maintained that,the EU chooses to impose the hard border, Dublin would be obliged to implement it on the ground. DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said the EU and the Irish Republic’s warnings of a hard Brexit were “mere bluffs”, adding: “They will not be putting any checkpoints at the border. “A recent mapping exercise carried out by the Irish army has discovered almost  more crossings points into NI than was previously thought, making the idea of imposing a hard border totally and utter impossible.”Offering an explanation as to why the Irish border was not addressed in his government’s contingency plans, Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said the backstop is the only solution.“For us to be giving signals that there’s any other way this could be solved would be foolish,” he told RTE.Mr Coveney added that it would not be helpful for the document to be “dominated by that border debate”.Dublin’s contingency plans identied affected sectors that would require up to between  and  pieces of new legislation.The no-deal plans include the purchase of land at ports to prevent congestion from new customs.Speaking at a media briefing, Mr Varadkar said: “The contingency plans we are making are very real but they are happening at our ports, particularly Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare, where we have acquired or are in the process of acquiring land and will develop border control posts in those places.“They may be needed in March in the event of a hard Brexit, butthey are not needed in March, they will be, or are very likely to be, needed at some point into the future.“So that is the contingency planning that we are making, but we are not making to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We simply cannot countenance that being the case.”try catch  TrendingThis is what N.I. prisoners will be eating on Christmas DayMan taken to hospital after incident in N.I. forestNorthern Ireland Christmas  payment dates for Universal Credit, tax credits, disability living allowance, PIP and moreSinn Fein mayor accused of lsquobad tastersquo over Irish Christmas cardN.I. family devastated after heartless thieves steal family pet          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Parents in Moira, Maralin and other outlying areas would rightly be thinking whether a bus to Lurgan, then another bus to Portadown in the morning, then reverse the process in the afternoon - earlier starting and later finishing – would be conducive to their children’s well-being or learning.“The best way to meet their needs is that they remain on the Toberhewny site where teachers who know them, really know them, can offer them a first-class education.“Educators will tell you that transition at any age can bring regression for many children so why in Lurgan are we willing to let this happen “Previous Craigavon Senior High School principals often said it took at least a full term for pupils to settle down to learn. We are always teaching for readiness and when relationships are formed, the learning can begin.” They said staff at Lurgan Junior High School ‘would willingly embrace these young people and provide for them the best educational outcomes possible with a curriculum suited to their needs’.Their letter added: “The ideal solution would be for the pupils to remain on the Toberhewny site at a new - school, which would accommodate not only our - children but also those who would have gone on to Craigavon Senior High School . Naturally those selected at  could continue to transfer to Lurgan College.Traffic ersions for those wishing to visit Rushmere or Portadown Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“A second preference would be for Craigavon Senior High School, Lurgan Campus to relocate temporarily to the Toberhewny site, while a long-term solution, such as the one above, could be considered.”They also pointed out: “We look, with both envy and admiration, at the plans for St Ronan’s College to have a £ million new school and Lismore Comprehensive with a new school on the way and congratulate them both. Our pupils deserve to be treated equally.“Lurgan Junior High School is almost  years old so now is the time to be bullish and push for a modern, state of the art solution for all children in our catchment area.” In an appeal to parents they said: “Make every effort to attend the consultation meeting, Ask questions at the meeting, Speak up for your children – all are important whether Grammar or High School pupils.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
