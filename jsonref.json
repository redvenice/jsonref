And to remind her that it knows precisely where she is and what she is doing.In Somalia, where the group controls vast swathes of the country, Al Shabaab is responsible for many thousands of violent deaths. It has attracted recruits from all over the world who are prepared to fight for it.To the outside world it is known for its most despicable acts of mass violence — the shooting at the upmarket Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in 2013 in which 71 died, the attack on Garissa University College in Kenya in 2015 which killed 147 the devastating truck bombing in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, in October 2017, in which up to 1,000 people lost their lives, one of the worst terror attacks ever to hit the African continent.         People in Kenya protest after gunmen attacked the town of Mpeketoni in 2014, which al Shabaab claimed responsibility for Al Shabaab has threatened to attack targets in the UK, the U.S. and France, and arguably as IS loses power, its influence will increase. Its aim is to overthrow the Somali government and set up an Islamic state in the country based on Sharia law, but there are more ambitious members who want to spread its caliphate across the world.         Mary Harper (pictured above) has penned a book titled \u0027Everything You Have Told Me Is True\u0027, which is out later this monthIts ruthlessly efficient intelligence arm has spies everywhere: ‘Cooks, soldiers, mechanics, cleaners, civil servants and street children can all be the eyes and ears of Al Shabaab,’ says Mary. ‘Some sympathise with the movement, while others are so terrified of it that they dare not refuse to carry out its demands.‘Al Shabaab is not a black-and-white phenomenon. Of course there are those who embrace it entirely and those who reject it. But there is a large grey area in between and plenty of blurred lines.’The media man, its conduit for channelling information to Mary, tells her in impeccable English — he has learnt it from listening to the BBC — every move she has made during a visit to Baidoa in south-west Somalia.‘I feel sick to my stomach,’ she explains, ‘because I try to be extremely discreet when I visit Somalia. I tell as few people as possible that I am coming to the country and switch off all my social media accounts when I am there.‘I change my local phone number regularly and use secure messaging apps whenever I can. Meetings are arranged at the last minute, with times and locations often changed. \u0027I do not talk openly about my internal travel plans, only sharing them with my two trusted security advisers. How could Al Shabaab know all these details?’‘We have been monitoring you wherever you go,’ the voice tells her. ‘We have people in the government, the security forces, NGOs, and the media who tell us everything.’He goes on to talk about the people she has met in Mogadishu. He gets it right every time. She says, ‘It makes me think of a phrase I hear so often from Somalis: “Al Shabaab is everywhere and you never know who is Al Shabaab.” ’                Mary boarded at Bedales School (library pictured above) before going on to University Al Shabaab have Mary’s British phone number and when she flies to London — she spends about a third of the year in Africa and the rest in the UK — she ‘almost invariably’ receives a call as she is collecting her luggage or in a cab back home.‘I am asked about my trip, what the weather is like in the UK, and given a blow-by-blow account of what I got up to in Somalia. They must have someone in the airport telling them I’ve got on the plane, which unnerves me.’The calls have come regularly over the past two years almost all from the same man. ‘When he is telling me about Al Shabaab atrocities his voice is staccato, as if he is reciting by rote. Then it can become quite gentle, even tender, which is even more disturbing.‘He asks me if I’ve been thinking about my religion. (He often attempts to persuade me to join the Muslim faith.) ‘He tells me, “You might think you have a lot of Somali friends, but they are not your real friends. Your true friends would save you from hellfire, which is where you will end up if you do not convert to Islam.”’         Mary studied anthropology and archaeology at Cambridge  University (pictured above) The voice affects concern, too, when he calls while she is driving her car in England. ‘He says, “You mustn’t answer your phone in the car or you’ll have an accident or be arrested.” ’I ask why she imagines he tells her so accurately about her movements why he also professes concern about her welfare.‘It might be to show me how efficient Al Shabaab are. It might just be showing off,’ she speculates. ‘And perhaps he is trying to win me over, to be sympathetic to them. I don’t think the aim is to unsettle me, because I am useful to them. Although I give them very little airtime, there will be a short line if they take responsibility for a bombing.’Nonetheless, I say, as a lone and conspicuous Western woman, she must be terrified of being killed. But she says her contact insists she is not on their target list.‘Although he says, “If you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time that’s just your bad luck.” And I got very angry about this because a good friend, a Somali journalist, was maimed in an attack, and I was told, “It was his fault. He went to a place where Government people eat.” They have this cold logic about people who get hurt or killed like this.’Mary is talking to me as her book about Al Shabaab is published. It is an astonishing account of the movement and gives a vivid insight into the lives of the Somalis who exist in the shadow of its terror.We meet at her mum Kay’s flat back in Britain — book-lined and busy with memorabilia from her African travels — and it is easy to see that Mary’s love of the continent is inherited.Kay, 74, a former aid worker, was a nurse with Save the Children in Mogadishu. Mary’s father, Professor Malcolm Harper, 83, taught at the University of Nairobi where Mary and her three siblings spent part of their childhood. She then boarded at Bedales and went on to Cambridge to study anthropology and archaeology.But it was her mum’s satellite phone that secured her job with the BBC. ‘It was the 1990s, before mobile phones, and I’d just joined the BBC’s African service. Mum’s satellite phone gave me a means of communication,’ she says.I ask Kay if she worries about her intrepid daughter: ‘You do worry, but you’re also proud because she does her job so well. I’d never say, “Don’t do it because I’m scared for you.” But I’m always very happy when she’s safely back in England.’Slender, gentle in manner and softly spoken, Mary’s unassuming demeanour masks a spine of steel. ‘I don’t think of myself as brave, but I am resourceful,’ she says. ‘I know how to make my way.’ I ask about her children — a son, aged 28 and 22-year-old daughter — and she is unforthcoming.Wasn’t she scared of leaving them motherless when she went to Somalia during their childhood? I press her. She declines to answer, other than to say that she travelled much less when they were little, and ‘took fewer risks’. ‘I keep my work and personal lives compartmentalised,’ she says with finality. When I ask about a husband or partner, she says merely that she is single.It is, of course, unsurprising that she does not elaborate: Al Shabaab know enough about her already. Since she has been back in London, her ‘contact’ has phoned her. ‘He asked, “Have you left the BBC?” I’ve been away from work for a while, and it was one of those concerned calls.It is hard to imagine the peril in which Mary operates.She came within a whisker of death on New Year’s Day, 2014, when the Jazeera Palace hotel in Mogadishu was attacked just a few doors away from where she was enjoying a meal with friends.‘Suddenly, an enormous blast thunders through the air,’ she writes. ‘It is as if the sound has hit us physically.‘Flames burst out of the hotel the mangled remains of the suicide vehicle which was rammed into the perimeter wall lies among other destroyed cars.’In Somalia, Mary reports, ‘girls as young as nine years old are abducted by Al Shabaab and forced into marriage. Boys are terrorised into joining. “I didn’t want to,” one child confesses, “but if you refuse they will kill you.” ’Anyone working for ‘infidels’ is hounded: Mary visits a sprawling camp in Mogadishu, crammed with displaced people escaping the insurgents. ‘I made and repaired soldiers’ uniforms,’ a tailor tells her. ‘Al Shabaab told me to stop making clothes for infidels, but I had to.‘I was also afraid of the soldiers (the government forces). Both the soldiers and Al Shabaab could kill me. I’d have been killed for repairing uniforms and killed for refusing to. The only thing to do was abandon my livelihood and come here.’The choice is often invidious: join, die — or flee and face destitution in the camps.The calls to Mary continue, unabated: she logs as many as 17 missed in a single hour of one day.In June last year, she went to Mogadishu, staying for the entire trip in secure accommodation in its airport compound. ‘Yet still the phone call came when I got back to London. “How was your trip to Mogadishu?”‘I tell my contact this makes me very scared. He replies, his voice almost tender, “You don’t need to be afraid of us. We have hundreds of enemies, but you’re not one of them.” ’Perhaps it is enough, for al Shabaab, that she is forced to listen to their gloating announcements of massacres and bombings enough too, that she knows their omnipresent eyes follow her everywhere.Everything You Have Told Me Is True by Mary Harper is published by Hurst on April 25 at £20. © Mary Harper 2019.

But what could we do if we were told it was the only way we could obtain a receipt, and therefore the only way we could receive our money back if the product proved defective?The fintech industry has already achieved its objective in California, where it ran a similar ‘skip the slip’ campaign — and where a new law will prevent shops issuing paper receipts unless a customer specifically asks for one.There is every reason why we should be given a paper receipt when we go shopping.How many of us would wait at the counter to make sure that the receipt we had been promised had actually arrived in an email? And if it didn’t, we would find ourselves unable to return defective goods.It is shameful that such bare-faced commercial interest is being hidden under the guise of environmental claims.Clearly, there are some genuine environmental campaigns which have achieved huge traction with the general public in recent years.         The Mail campaigned against single-use plastics. The items kill a large number of animals         A plastic garfield phone that washed up on a beach in Le Conquet, western France, this yearThe campaign championed by the Mail against single-use plastics, for example, has plenty of justification — discarded plastic is killing large numbers of creatures and threatens to litter the countryside, coast and seas for thousands of years to come.But receipts? The claims made by Beat The Receipt just don’t stand up. How can the manufacture of 11.2 billion receipts a year consume ‘millions of trees, millions of barrels of oil and billions of gallons of water’?Let’s just take the ‘millions of trees’: ten million trees would mean only 1,000 or so receipts per tree, so they would have to be pretty slender trees!There must be more paper in the ‘Vote Liberal Democrat’ leaflet I had put through my door yesterday than in all the receipts I gather in a month — probably longer. In fact, figures from California suggest that receipts account for less than 0.1 per cent of all paper produced — an utterly insignificant proportion.But the boldest claim of Beat The Receipt is that receipts are poisoning us. The thermal paper on which many of them are printed, it says, contain BPA, a ‘substance classified as toxic to humans and wildlife by the EU’.But there are toxic materials and there are toxic materials. In fact, in 2015 the European Food Safety Authority reviewed the scientific evidence on BPA — which is also used in a wide number of plastics — and concluded that ‘BPA poses no health risk to consumers of any age group (including unborn children, infants and adolescents) at current exposure levels’.In other words, even the BPA in the plastic wrapping around your cheese or in the plastic bottle containing fruit juice is not doing you any harm. It is preposterous, then, to claim consumers are being harmed by small amounts of it in their receipts.In any case, it is perfectly possible to manufacture paper receipts without BPA — something that the industry has committed to doing by next year.There is a far greater environmental hazard: the manufacture of smartphones — yes, the devices on which Beat The Receipt wants us to get our receipts instead.An analysis by Liverpool John Moores University revealed the damage being wrought on the environment by the mining of rare-earth metals for the manufacture of smartphones.Many of these materials are obtained from China, where vast amounts of toxic waste are a by-product. Moreover, resources of these rare metals — which include neodymium and dysprosium — are extremely limited, and could become exhausted over the next 20 to 50 years.In other words, if you want to stop receiving paper receipts because you think they are a menace to the environment, you wouldn’t want to use a smartphone, either.The paper receipt is a time-honoured part of shopping. It allows us to take back and exchange goods which prove to be defective.It also comes in useful, as I have found on a couple of occasions, when anti-shoplifting alarms mistakenly go off on your way out of a shop. I don’t want to be fumbling around with a smartphone while some burly security guard accuses me of shoplifting.Compared with so many of the other things we use in everyday life, receipts are also pretty harmless from an environmental point of view. In any case, shouldn’t the firms themselves come up with a paper receipt that isn’t as environmentally damaging as is claimed?We should not allow ourselves to be bullied into giving them up by an industry which is really motivated by its own commercial interests, not the environment."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/23/13/10180828-0-image-m-13_1550930177351.jpg","title":"Labour MP Richard Burgon claimed oath didnt say Zionism enemy peace","story":"Share this article          Newly unearthed footage shows Mr Burgon, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, making a speech to a Labour Party event in 2014       Richard Burgon is pictured second from the left with Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn and members of the shadow cabinet          The Labour MP was brought up in Yorkshire by two teachers, and is a heavy metal fan The newspaper’s lawyer asked him about the 2016 Mail story, which read: ‘Justice spokesman Richard Burgon has urged MPs and 17 party members to quit the Labour Friends of Israel group, declaring Zionism is the enemy of peace.’ Mr Burgon replied: ‘That’s what the article says, yes.’ When asked if the article was right, he said: ‘At the time – I believe you wrote to the Daily Mail asking when it was alleged I said this, what event in what year, and they couldn’t say.

File photograph: Alan BetsonPlans for a €75 million retail park at Carrickmines in south Dublin have been given the go-ahead, despite concerns being raised by two State transport agencies about its impact on the M50. Iput, one of the State’s largest property funds, has secured permission from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for the development at “the Park” retail complex bordering Ballyogan Road, adjacent to Junction 15 on the motorway.The scheme, which represents a 83,996sq m addition to the existing Park retail facilities, includes shops, restaurants, retail warehouses, 130 apartments and leisure facilities including an indoor skying arena.Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) told the council last April that the proposed development would have an “adverse effect on the operation, safety and efficiency of the M50”. Granting permission for the scheme would be at variance with official national policy to control developments affecting national roads, and was contrary to policies on sustainable transport, TII said.‘Not convinced’Following the TII submission, the council asked the developers to make changes to the plans. However, last November TII again wrote to the council saying it was “not convinced” its concerns had been addressed.It said the M50 was “the most heavily trafficked road corridor in the country” and the trend for increasing traffic on the the motorway was “unsustainable”.The submission noted that additional traffic volumes likely to be generated by development “would further exacerbate the operational safety and efficiency of the M50 corridor and undermine the benefits of public investment” in the motorway.The National Transport Authority (NTA) said the proposed development, with about 49,010sq m of “trip-attracting” land uses and about 1,150 parking spaces, was “excessive” for the locality. It said a reduction in parking should be a stated condition of any subsequent decision to grant permission.The council attached more than 30 conditions when it granted permission, including construction of a new link road, a reduction of 60 car parking spaces, and the use of paid parking for the commercial parts of the development.Residential elementIt praised the “high quality of the scheme’s overall design concept”, noted its inclusion of a residential element, and said it was “well served by public transport”.“The traffic impact will be huge, clogging up the local and national road network. The M50 junctions are already bursting with high levels of existing traffic,” she said, adding that additional retail development was not needed in south Dublin. “It is homes for families, young adults, locals, critical workers and older people who want local downsize options, that are needed.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3863768.1555521339!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland s reliance on nurses coming from abroad rises further","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome 1,234 nurses and midwives last year applied to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland for a certificate of current professional status. Photograph: iStockThe number of new nurses and midwives registering to work in Ireland has reached record levels, as has Ireland’s reliance on staff coming from abroad.Fewer than 30 per cent of the 4,684 newly-registered nurses and midwives in 2017 were trained in Ireland, according to the annual report of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). Almost 33 per cent were trained outside the EU and 37 per cent in other EU states.While our health system becomes increasingly reliant on overseas staff, there are indications that Irish nurses and midwives are leaving in greater numbers.Some 1,234 nurses and midwives last year applied to NMBI for a certificate of current professional status, the third year in a row this figure has increased. The certificate, which is required to practice abroad, is generally seen as an indication of a person’s intention to leave though they may not, in fact, go.Two-thirds of those requesting certificates were Irish-trained, while 12 per cent were from India and 10 per cent trained in the UK. One in five of the Irish-trained nurses seeking certificate had registered with the board in the previous year, indicated that many of those leaving may be younger nurses and midwives early in their careers.About 70,000 nurses and midwives are registered currently, of which 59 per cent are Irish-trained and 20 per cent are UK-trained. Eight per cent were trained in India and 6 per cent in Philippines. A further 30,000 nurses are on the register but are considered inactive.ComplaintsThe number of complaints about nurses almost doubled in 2017, to 127, according to the report. About one-third of these will progress to an inquiry.In contrast to previous years, when most complaints were made by employers or work colleagues, 63 per cent of the complaints in 2017 came from the public. Some patients made complaints against multiple staff – up to eight.Medication management and an alleged failure to assess a patient’s condition were the more frequent cause of complaint, but other complaints related to verbal and physical abuse and drug abuse, including theft of drugs, forging of prescriptions and being on duty in an unfit state.Five nurses and midwives who had been convicted of a criminal offence were referred to the board, of whom one has been struck off so far. Three more nurses and midwives had their registration cancelled for professional failings.‘Dysfunctional’Three years ago, two consultancy reports into the NMBI found the organisation was “dysfunctional” and failing to carry out many of its official responsibilities. Arrangements for dealing with fitness-to-practise complaints against nurses were “unfit for purpose” and were “swamping” employees, it was found.The latest annual report shows 27 hearings were held in 2017, when almost €3 million was spent on legal fees relating to the fitness-to-practise process.The report says the board is “on a journey” of reform, “maintaining the trust and confidence of the public and professionals in us as regulator, becoming more efficient and effective to deal with, and having an organisation that is appropriately equipped will not be achieved overnight”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Data from swifts who fly 10,000km from Africa to these shores tells a remarkable storyDemocrat says she will help renewed push in Congress to pass extension of E3 visas to IrishTransport agencies had raised concerns about impact on M50 by Dublin developmentHundreds of Irish-trained nurses sought certs allowing them to practice abroad in 2017Only a handful of species have been shown to possess the ability of visual self-recognitionBessborough, Bethany, Castlepollard, Pelletstown and Sean Ross: what we have learnedMother-and-baby home inquiry dismisses archaeologist\u0026rsquos suggestion of \u0026lsquoburial vault\u0026rsquoParty\u0026rsquos social media commercials are being shown mostly to people over the age of 55Arrest brings to eight the number of people detained for questioning about incidentTaoiseach tells Nancy Pelosi at State dinner the Belfast Agreement is \u0026lsquostill unfulfilled\u0026rsquoAccommodation centre not told of man\u0026rsquos condition due to data-protection policyBid to curtail debate on Bill defeated by 26 votes to 24 in the SeanadTaoiseach says commission of investigation\u0026rsquos fifth interim report makes \u0026lsquogruesome reading\u0026rsquoLeo Varadkar hails 70th anniversary of a \u0026lsquosignificant moment\u0026rsquo in Ireland\u0026rsquos historyMinister says public and private patients will have access to same drugs in State hospitalsMinister proposes to seek approval for Central Bank (Amendment) Bill before summerHistorian whose work led to establishment of commission says \u0026lsquothe whole truth\u0026rsquo is outCompany, which has 116 outlets, says \u0026lsquoevery little bit counts\u0026rsquo in effort to protect environment"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3863857.1555526738!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup targets english voters for funds with pro brexit adverts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrom left to right: DUP MP Gavin Robinson, party leader Arlene Foster, MEP candidate Diane Dodds and Westminster leader Nigel Dodds launch Mrs Dodds’s campaign for the European election. Photograph: Michael McHughPA Wire Northern Ireland’s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is running ads on Facebook to raise money in England only as part of a new fundraising drive on social media.The party’s “Support Brexit – Support the DUP” ads are being shown mostly to people over the age of 55 – an age group that voted in the majority for Brexit - and only in England where the party has no candidates.Facebook data on the ad, which features photographs of DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds, says it was being shown only to people living in England.Some 37 per cent of the people being shown the ad were aged 65 years or older and a further 25 per cent are aged between 55 and 64, according to the data on the ad.The ad had been viewed between 5,000 and 10,000 times since it began running on Tuesday, just weeks ahead of European and local elections.Asked why the DUP was running the ad in England where the party had no candidates, a spokesman said the DUP wants to see the UK’s vote in the 2016 referendum, to leave the EU, implemented.“The DUP wants to see a deal as we exit the EU which respects the referendum result and works for every part of the United Kingdom, ” he said.“People in England, Scotland and Wales as well as Northern Ireland support our position. We welcome such support.”The spokesman said that the party was not targeting any particular age group with the ad.The People’s Vote campaign, which is pushing for a public vote on the final Brexit deal, believes the ad shows the DUP are turning their focus to England because of the anti-Brexit feeling in Northern Ireland.“The DUP have plainly realised that opinion in Northern Ireland has turned sharply against Brexit and so they cannot afford to be seen promoting it with local and European elections approaching,” said a source with the campaign.“Maybe their funders in the business community have bailed on them too.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: ProvisionBessboroughMore than 900 children born in, or admitted to the Bessborough Mother and Baby Home outside Cork city died in infancy or early childhood, but the Commission of Investigation has discovered the graves of just 64 of them.Bessborough was run by the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, but the order of nuns has told the Commission of Investigation, which produced its fifth interim report on Wednesday, that they do not know where the other children are buried.Describing the order’s declaration as “difficult to comprehend”, the commission said an affidavit on burials, including institutions in Castlepollard and Sean Ross, “was, in many respects, speculative, inaccurate and misleading”. The record of deaths at Bessborough does not include any information about burials, said the commission, adding that the identification of burial places has “proven to be very challenging”.Many former residents and advocacy groups assumed that the children who died at Bessborough were interred in the small burial ground there, but the commission thinks this “unlikely”. Oral evidence and affidavits from members of the congregation provided “remarkably little evidence”. One member of the congregation said they remembered no deaths during her time there, which ned a period of 50 years. In one 10-year stretch during this time, 31 deaths took place. “It is rather surprising that she does not remember any deaths,” the commission notes.The commission conducted extensive searches for alternative burial grounds within Bessborough and, while it is “clear that there are a number of locations within the grounds where burials could have taken place”, it found no evidence of where this may have occurred. Members of the public have come forward suggesting possible locations on the grounds but, again, no physical evidence has been produced showing that these sites contain remains. Nonetheless, the commission considers it “highly likely” that burials did take place in the grounds. The commission did not consider it feasible to excavate Bessborough’s 60 acres, or the 200 acres covered by the former estate. Bessborough children were buried at several other cemeteries in Cork, and tracked down by the commission. Fifty-four children who died there were buried in St Joseph’s cemetery. The commission says it “seems plausible” to suggest the remains of unclaimed Bessborough children were buried in Cork District Cemetery, but the commission has not been able to find direct evidence of this – at least one Bessborough child was buried here, and a former administrator said many of the children were buried there the commission tracked down children buried at St Michael’s cemetery, and four at St Finbarr’s who had an association with Bessborough. Fourteen mothers died in Bessborough, and the commission has not been able to identify where they were buried. The commission found that 522 children died at the Cork County Home which was closely “interconnected” with Bessborough, and they are likely buried in Carr’s Hill, although there is no documentary evidence available.The Bethany Homes institution in Dublin was mainly for Church of Ireland women. The main burial site for children who died there was Mount Jerome in Harold’s Cross. Its burial registers show that 240 children who were born in, or admitted to, the Bethany Home died between September 1922 and 1964, which the commission says “constitutes the majority of known deaths of Bethany Home children”. The children are buried in a series of unmarked graves. The report finds that multiple children were buried in the same grave which, when it reached full capacity, “was simply closed and the next available grave with spare capacity was used”. Records at Mount Jerome are described as “very good”. There are, however, at least 20 other children who died and are not recorded in the Mount Jerome register. The commission found no evidence of any child from Bethany being used as an anatomical subject, unlike in other institutions.According to an affidavit submitted by the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, which ran Castlepollard, all of the children buried in the institution’s graveyard were accorded the rites of the Catholic Church and not buried in unapproved cemeteries. The commission noted there is documentary evidence of the burials and, while the order’s assertions “may well be true”, no evidence was provided to support them. Over 220 children died in Castlepollard or hospitals they were sent to from there. The commission has “no reason to doubt” that the burials occurred on site, but there is no register of burials to verify this. Pelletstown, an institution initially located on the Navan Road and then on Eglinton Road in Dublin, was run by the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul. The commission has found that deaths at the institution, which also housed very ill children, “were appropriately recorded”. The majority of children were buried in the so-called Poor Ground burial plots, later renamed the Angel’s Plot in Glasnevin Cemetery. The commission found that while some checking needs to be completed, “it is clear that the majority of the children are buried in Glasnevin and their names are recorded in the burial registers there”.Records compiled in Sean Ross, run by the Sacred Heart congregation, show that over 1,000 children died at the institution or at the District Hospital in Roscrea. There is a designated child burial ground at the site, and the commission has been “made aware of concerns” about it. A geophysical study and test excavation have been undertaken. The results are being examined."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3863903.1555532619!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tuam home findings from expert are rejected by commission","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA pair of baby shoes with the message ‘Bury us with dignity’ hangs on a wall at the site of the Tuam mother-and-baby home. Photograph: Andy NewmanAn expert working for the order of nuns which ran the Tuam mother-and-baby home in Co Galway argued in January this year that the underground structure containing infant remains at the site may have been “designed as a burial vault and then used as such”.The suggestion was rejected by the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, which found in its interim report released on Wednesday that the structure “was not a recognised burial ground or purpose-built burial chamber”. The commission said the chambered structure “did not provide for the dignified interment of human remains” and was “likely” to be related to treatment of sewage andor waste water.The commission, chaired by retired Circuit Court judge Yvonne Murphy, was set up in February 2015 to investigate 14 mother-and-baby homes, and four “county homes”, which operated across the State between 1922 and 1998.Its newly published fifth interim report found that the burial locations of hundreds of children who died in the State’s mother-and-baby homes remain unknown. It also raised questions for religious institutions, communities and organs of the State about how the children’s remains were treated, and how their deaths were recorded.Scientific analysisIn the instance of Tuam, a scientific analysis undertaken by the commission team on the underground chambers containing human remains “suggests that at least some of the chambers in which human remains were found were at some stage used to receive sewage”. The precise purpose of the overall structure, the commission found, is “likely to be related to the treatmentcontainment of sewage andor waste water”. The commission also found that if it had been designed as a crypt “an entirely different type of structure would have been expected”.In a statement, a spokesman for the congregation said that after being asked to respond to a draft of the report the order commissioned a forensic archaeologist to assist in the process. “The brief was simply to examine the archaeological elements and prepare a report. He did so and submitted it to the commission. The commission has examined that report and has rejected its findings, as is their absolute right.” Council responseThe commission also found it is “likely the burials were conducted on the instructions of the sisters”. And it said Galway County Council did not respond when it shared draft and technical reports with the local authority in 2017 and 2018. The interim report made a number of findings concerning the level of knowledge about Tuam within the local authority.It said council members and staff “must have known something about the manner of burial when the home was in operation”. Board of Health meetings were sometimes held in the home itself. The report also found that employees of the council “must have known about the burials” as they worked on the site.In a statement, Galway County Council said it “notes the contents” of the report. “The council has and will continue to afford the commission its full co-operation and assistance in undertaking its work.” The local authority said it had no comment when asked further questions.Catherine Corless, the local historian whose work led to the establishment of the commission, said she was “very, very pleased” with the report. She agreed with a suggestion made by Minister for Children Katherine Zappone that iniduals must know more about what happened at Tuam. In the Dáil on Wednesday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar described the report as “gruesome reading” which “gives us a further insight into a very dark part of our history”.“As a society we inherit a deep shame for what was done back then,” he said, adding that society had to atone for what happened in those homes."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3862749.1555441580!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us politicians and brexiteers clash on concocted border issue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Research Group chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg was involved in “frank exchanges” on the Border issue with the US delegation, led by Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaEPAThe visiting US congressional delegation had a forceful and at times heated encounter with pro-Brexit UK hardliners as the American politicians rejected claims that the Border was a “concocted” issue.The delegation, led by the Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, met members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, led by Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, on Monday. The meeting was part of their mission to the UK and Ireland this week to stress that there was no chance of a US-UK trade deal if Brexit damaged the Northern Irish peace process. Democratic congressman Brendan Boyle, one of the members of the travelling delegation, said the US politicians had a “frank discussion” with the ERG that was “a good, sincere, honest exchange”.The Pennsylvania representative said the delegation’s warning about any post-Brexit risk to the peace process jeopardising any future UK-US trade deal and the challenge of passing any trade deal through the US congress amid the current climate “acted as a reality check” on some UK politicians they met. Ms Pelosi said she and her fellow delegates made it clear in all their meetings in London that there would be “no chance whatsoever” of a US-UK trade deal if Brexit weakened the 1998 Belfast Agreement.“A number of the ERG members were not exactly pleased with what they heard from the US side,” he said. The two-term congressman said the overwhelming majority of the UK politicians they met appreciated the position of the US delegation and “the constructive role that we are playing”.“The one exception clearly was the ERG who never explicitly accused us of taking sides but, as they expressed it, it is clear that their world view is that the Border issue is ‘concocted’ and that it is really just being used by Remainers in London, Brussels, Dublin and Washington all in some sort of grand conspiracy to force them to do something that they don’t want to do,” said Mr Boyle.Mr Rees-Mogg told the delegation during their meeting that the ERG included two former Northern Ireland secretaries of state, Theresa Villiers and Owen Paterson. Mr Boyle said the delegation attempted to argue against the ERG’s characterisation of the US role. “We very much attempted to disabuse them of that sort of conspiracy-type thinking,” he said. The Philadelphia politician, the only House member with an Irish-born parent, noted the positive role played by the US in the peace process and how this was ultimately applauded by the UK.“The idea that some folks in London, Dublin, Brussels and Washington DC are all acting together as part of some grand conspiracy in making up our concerns for a re-establishment of a hard border is a world view that is extremely difficult for me to understand,” said Mr Boyle.The Democrat said the appointment of a US special envoy by the Trump administration could prove “constructive and helpful” in the Brexit process, particularly in the absence of a Northern Ireland Assembly.

Photograph: MaxwellsHandout It’s been so very dull in Leinster House of late. Wednesday changed all that. The arrival of two special guests precipitated an unprecedented outpouring of giddiness and mortification in the Dáil chamber along with some outstanding displays of fawning brass neckery from starstuck politicians. Not since the Senators made a holy show of themselves in front of first minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon have there been such scenes. The VIP guest of honour was Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives. She was invited by the Ceann Comhairle as part of his continuing programme of celebrations to mark the centenary of Dáil Éireann. In order to make sure that there would a good crowd when Nancy and her large entourage of congressmen and women arrived, former TDs and senators were invited to attend the event to take the bare look off the proceedings. TDs can’t be relied upon to attend special Dáil speeches by world leaders. This can lead to embarrassing gaps in the expensive seats. It was a master stroke to plug the holes on Wednesday with former Oireachtas members so delighted to be back they would applaud anything. Attorney General Séamus Woulfe settled into the Distinguished Visitors Gallery, all on his own. With the addition of the returned ex-politicians, happy as sandlarks and full of the joys, the absence of most of the left-wing TDs wasn’t noticeable and the atmosphere was very jolly.The doors at the top of the main staircase opened and in walked Bono and his wife, Ali Hewson. They had signed the visitors book before entering. Name: “Bono”. Address: “Madame Speaker. Wow!” It must be a little-known millionaire’s townland in Killiney. Over The EdgeThe sight of Bono tipped some of the already-giddy audience over the edge. (As opposed to The Edge, to whom Nancy Pelosi sent her regards during her speech.) They whipped out their phones, disregarding the rules and started taking snaps for tweeting purposes.Jaded sketchwriters on the press gallery wept quiet tears of happiness.No sooner was Bono in the door than Senator Frankie Feighan was upon him. He later told us that he was sucked into the great man’s orbit when they passed each other. The Roscommon Senator did his best to monopolise him but a vicious queue of admirers was already beginning to form. The ever-proud to be utterly shameless Terry Leyden bumped himself into the VIP section, plonking down next to Bono. The AG’s eyes were out on stalks. Across the floor, they were in stitches on the Fianna Fáil benches as Senator Leyden fished a business card from his pocket and solemnly handed it over to Bono. Micheál Martin rolled his eyes. Terry took out his phone, forcing Bono into a selfie while the Attorney General stealth photobombed them from the seat behind.Former Labour TD from Clare Michael McNamara tried to grab Bono’s attention, but he was no match for former taoiseach Enda Kenny who ran Terry from the bullpen in order to commence an animated conversation with the rock star. There was much prodding of the Bonovoxial upper arm by Kenny. Kerry Senator Paul Coghlan brazenly interposed and secured himself a handshake from both of them. No sign yet of Nancy – who is a huge U2 fan and had asked if Bono could attend as the panting crowd grew around the diminutive star. Then heavyweight opposition arrived in the form of Gerry Adams, who greeted Bono like an old friend before handing him a large brown envelope.At this stage, Madame Speaker’s large entourage was in the chamber and Adams, an old Washington hand, immediately launched into the middle of them. Also there was Kerry FF Senator Mark Daly, who is never out of America, where, unlike Ireland, it’s actually a big thing to be a senator and people take them seriously. Mahogany tanDaly sat in the single row of seats in the upper chamber set out for the visiting members of Congress, as if he was one of them, grinning like a man possessed. Adams, meanwhile, was hugging a congressman wearing a loud green tie and sporting a deep mahogany tan. “Who’s that very old man in the front row?” asked a young political reporter of the grizzled and ancient . “Eh, that’s Donie Cassidy,” we sighed. Donie, who has spent a lifetime in showbiz, ignored Bono at the end of the speeches and was one of the few to buttonhole the departing Nancy.There was no room for late arriving Ministers. Regina Doherty ended up sitting outside the upper rail, as did Richard Burton, who was concealed behind a pillar. Shane Ross, aka Winston Churchtown, had to stand at the door nearest Bono, which will have a been thrill for the visiting superstar who flagrantly flouted chamber rules by wearing sunglasses (blue-tinted). He also had another pair of glasses in his top pocket. The Taoiseach, known for an embarrassing habit of going weak at the knees in the presence of music celebrities, marched into the chamber with a serious sense of purpose. Everyone watched with bated breath as he neared the sainted Bono (because there would be no mention of tax on the day that was in it).Leo, with commendable composure and restraint, swept past the VIP bullpen without giving it a glance and proceeded to his seat. This may have been the finest moment of his career. Finally, a tall, distinguished-looking man walking with the aid of an underarm crutch arrived to rescue Bono. This was Paul Pelosi, the husband of the third most powerful woman in America. Minutes later, Nancy arrived to her first standing ovation. Very thin in that Capitol Hill fashion, wearing a light-pink suit and very high pink shoes, she walked like a delicate flamingo. Beside her, the Ceann Comhairle was threatening to explode with joy. The speeches, reported in glorious detail elsewhere in this newspaper, were full of mutual appreciation and punctuated by rounds of fervent applause. It was a lovely occasion, although the response from the home team seemed somewhat saccharine and needy at times. Although, to be fair, a Bono-induced madness had taken hold. The first mention of John F Kennedy came from Pelosi just before 1pm and Mark Daly looked like he was going to burst into tears with the emotion of it all. Poets were mentioned.Wild applauseThen Speaker Pelosi launched into a heartfelt appreciation of Bono. With a wry, self-deprecating smile, the man led the applause for himself and the politicians thunderously joined in. Then he did a little bow. Bono and Nancy, we noticed, are both blessed with luxurious heads of sweeping hair in similar shades of deep glossy chestnut.When the speaker praised Ireland as a modern nation that has “blossomed”, mentioning the recent referendums on marriage equality and abortion, Independent Senator Ronan Mullen bowed his head and then walked from the chamber. After a closing standing ovation, Pelosi shook hands warmly with the Taoiseach and Cabinet members. Then Gerry Adams closed in. Nancy gave him hug and caressed his beard. Ushers escorted her from the chamber as the selfie-brigade closed in.Bono wasn’t so lucky. He was hemmed into the small gallery by the political rubberneckers. Mark Daly was photographing the members of Congress. Senior politicians from the main parties looked on, mortified. The Attorney General was trapped in the bullpen. So was Mrs Bono. As for Mr Pelosi, he ended up pressed against the railing, using his crutch for support, as the onslaught continued. The Taoiseach left, pausing to talk to two elderly former Fianna Fáil TDs on his way to the opposite doors, where he paused for a moment to cast a lingering look back towards the scenes around Bono, who had to be bundled out the door behind the Ceann Comhairle’s chair. He sat between Nancy and Seán Ó Feargháil during lunch in the Members Restaurant. They dined on “classic Irish Caesar salad” and roast monkfish with saffron, mussels and samphire. There was a “dark chocolate moon” for dessert. The Ceann Comhairle introduced Nancy to Cathaoirleach Denis O’Donovan, his opposite number in the Seanad. Perhaps the strange title confused her. “Mr President!” she cried, deeply honoured. Dignified Denis didn’t know where to look. Later in the afternoon, she met the real deal in Áras an Uachtaráin and Senator Daly waved the Americans off from outside Leinster House. Bono, by then, had left the building.

Tucked in the roof space under the eaves of buildings, these nests are not the easiest to find with the naked eye. “Most people thought I was a TV inspector with binoculars,” he says.What he found – or didn’t find – was significant. A community care centre in Clonmel had one of the largest known swift colonies in the country, but overall, numbers were low. “Locals said they’d all seen a decline,” he says. Out of 86 towns, Hayes recorded nests in just 24 of them. “Many people don’t have a notion about swifts. One man had eight nests under his eaves – he said he’d never seen a swift in his life. These birds come from Africa, and the only time they land is in the gap in your house. He was delighted when I told him – his eyes lit up! That’s what we need.”Swifts arrive in Ireland in May having travelled 10,000km from Africa. Their migratory route is still a bit of a mystery but a scientist who is trying to piece it together is Dr Kendrew Colhoun of the RSPB in Northern Ireland. He’s the ultimate swift stalker, and is filling the data gaps by tagging the birds with fingernail-sized solar-panelled trackers which log their every move.Swifts weight the same as a Creme Egg, so this technology has to be feather-light. “We put the tag on a miniature harness, like a little backpack. When they return to Ireland, I take off the tag and download the data,” says Dr Colhoun. The data tells a remarkable story. “Swifts are travelling across 26 countries on a single journey between Ireland and Africa – from the UK, France, Spain, Portugal, all the way down to Congo, Angola, Botswana and Zambia.” Dr Colhoun reckons that they fly 40,000km a year.Feed and breedSwifts come here to feed and breed. They pair for life (some can live up to 20 years) and return to the same nest site every year. But this is where they – sometimes, literally – hit a brick wall, because if the building has been renovated or the eaves blocked, then the swifts are immediately nestless. “In Banagher, two roofs were replaced in the town and we lost two colonies,” says Ricky Whelan of Birdwatch Ireland. “They return from Africa, try to find their nests but they can’t get in. It freaks them out, they get agitated and it can take them years to find a new nest.”In 2011, Lynda Huxley noticed that swift numbers around her workplace in GMIT Castlebar campus were low. She got funding from Mayo County Council to put up artificial nest boxes and within three years the swifts were breeding. “Lecturers donated money for cameras in the boxes because people wanted to know what has happening inside,” she says. “We now livestream the nests every summer.”Huxley’s approach is to encourage councils to put hollow “swift bricks” in all public buildings so that the birds have somewhere to nest. “Swifts are icons of urban spaces. My goal is to identify one building project in every town – Castlebar’s swimming pool, Louisburgh’s school, Westport’s town hall,” she says. “But to have a secure future for swifts, we need commitment from Government.”As they sit in the nests and grow, swift chicks are hungry, insatiable creatures and their soot-brown parents are constantly hunting for insects to feed them. Large waterbodies can provide rich pickings for the birds to catch aerial insects such as flying ants, spiders and flies. “A big surprise is that swifts who nest in urban Belfast will do a 50-mile commute to Lough Neagh to feed,” says Dr Culhoun. They store hundreds of insects in a throat pouch before regurgitating the golf ball-sized bolus into their chicks’ throats. If the weather is cold and insects are hard to find, the chicks will reduce their heart activity for a few days until the parents return and cough up.Could it be that swifts have to travel longer distances to find enough food because insects numbers are plummeting? Scientists don’t know for certain because there’s a chronic lack of long-term, large-scale data on Irish insects, but hunger is undoubtedly a factor. “Swifts are limited by insect abundance,” says Whelan. “On current projections, for the next 20 years, I think there will be further reductions in numbers. At some point the population will be too small to sustain itself.”Sexual maturitySwifts are most comfortable in the air. Their legs – if you could even call them that – are stubby. “If you watch them walking around the nest, it’s like humans trying to walk on our elbows,” says Huxley. Before they leave the nest, chicks will do push-ups to prepare their muscles for what’s ahead: three years of constant flying until they reach sexual maturity. Once they take off, they become the fastest bird in level flight and reach speeds of 20 metres a second. They whoosh, swoop and swirl recklessly through the sky like aerial joyriders. It’s like watching Ayrton Senna at the wheel of a Formula 1 car.“Swifts cannot fly slow,” says Dr Per Henningson of Oxford University’s animal flight group. “It’s unusual because most birds can fly slow. Swifts have to come into their nests at high speed and make an abrupt stop. So they don’t come in level – they come in low and use gravity to stop. In half a metre, that’s a dramatic break.”Their adaptation to life in the air is extreme. Nap time? Up they go for a snooze. “If you’re sitting out in an evening watching them, all of a sudden they’re gone,” says Dr Henningson. “They fly 2,000 metres up and from the tracking data we see they orientate themselves into the wind and slowly turn. You can see they sleep for about 10 minutes, slowly descend and then they wake up, ascend and do the same cycle.”Intoxicating acrobaticsTheir high-pitched screeching is as distinctive as their intoxicating acrobatics in the sky. For bird expert Eric Dempsey, this ebullient yikkering was the soundtrack of his childhood. “I grew up in Finglas and my dad would bring us to the Botanic Gardens and we’d stand at the entrance and look up and there would be swifts everywhere. That screaming sound they make was the essence of Dublin in the summer. The countryside had cuckoos and corncrakes the city had swifts. You’d watch them soar and it was mesmerising – the ultimate air show.”Swift populations are free falling in the last 15 years, they’ve gone down by 46 per cent. “My notebook goes back 40 years,” says Eric. “Their decline has been very dramatic.” This is backed up by research from Birdwatch Ireland. “Towns and villages in Laois, Westmeath and Tipperary now have no swifts at all,” says Ricky Whelan.What can the public do to help prepare for the swifts’ return in a few weeks’ time? Birdwatch Ireland has a new guide that offers suggestions. If you own a building, put a swift box on it or ask your local school or church to do the same. Tell your politicians to make space for swifts in public spaces. Don’t forget that without insects, they’ll starve. “Don’t use insecticides,” pleads Lynda Huxley. “We have to remember that swifts have been around for 49 million years. Why should our actions deprive them of their existence?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3863871.1555527381!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"france s attention turns to rebuilding of notre dame","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople outside Saint Sulpice  participate in the Chrism Mass as part of Holy Week, as bells ring in tribute to Notre Dame Cathedral. Photograph: Ian LangsdonBells rang all over France in a magnificent homage to Notre Dame cathedral at 6.50pm on Wednesday, 48 hours after a devastating fire broke out in the attic of the mother of cathedrals.Crowds formed in front of the Sacré Coeur and Saint-Sulpice in Paris, where first lady Brigitte Macron attended a Holy Week Mass.The positive, forward-looking tone set by President Emmanuel Macron in a televised address on Tuesday night has taken hold. The words “reconstruct” and “rebuild” recur in all official pronouncements and in most news headlines.The weekly cabinet meeting was entirely devoted to Notre Dame. Mr Macron formally launched the reconstruction of the cathedral at a later meeting with the prime minister, six cabinet ministers, the head of Unesco, the mayor of Paris, the archbishop of Paris and officials in charge of architectural heritage.Prime minister Edouard Philippe announced that a draft law intended to provide a legal framework for the reconstruction will be presented next week.More than €1.1 billion has already been raised. Mr Philippe said 75 per cent of contributions of up to €1,000 will be tax exempt, while donations of more than €1,000 carry a 66 per cent deduction against tax. An earlier law, which gives a 60 per cent deduction for patronage of the arts, will apply to large corporations.The tax deductions have created the first controversy of the reconstruction effort, with opposition politicians noting that taxpayers will have to make up the revenue shortfall. The Pinault family, who have pledged €100 million, said they will not claim the deduction.Mr Philippe said an international competition will choose an architect “to endow Notre Dame with a new spire adapted to the techniques and challenges of our era”.Spire optionsThe government must decide whether to copy the original 13th-century spire, which was lost in the revolution, or the 19th-century spire erected by Viollet-le-Duc. Or it could commission a contemporary work. Several cathedrals, including Rouen, have wrought iron spires.A similar dilemma is posed by the replacement of “the forest”, the 100m-long, 10m-high wooden roof which was reduced to ashes. Some 1,300 oak trees were required to build it in the 13th century.There is scepticism that Mr Macron’s five-year deadline to rebuild the cathedral in time for the Paris Olympics can be met. “There are not enough stocks of wood in France already sawed for such a construction,” Sylvain Charlois, the head of France’s leading timber company, told Agence France Presse.France may opt for a concrete roof, as Reims did after German shellfire burned its cathedral in the first World War. Or it could use metal, as Chartres did when its wooden roof burned in 1836.The city of Paris will hold a ceremony of homage on Thursday afternoon “to all those who helped save Notre Dame cathedral”. The prelude from Bach’s cello suite No 1 will be played. The mayor of Paris, the rector of Notre Dame and the commander of the Paris fire brigade will all make speeches.Bell tower priorityFiremen recounted their overnight battle at a press conference on Wednesday. Access to the bell towers on the façade was a major difficulty, said deputy commander Philippe Demay. He described the winding stairs up the north tower, familiar to millions of past visitors. “It is very small and narrow. There is not much light and our equipment is heavy,” Mr Demay said. “When we finally got to the balcony, we saw a catastrophic scene, with the roof burning.”Images from police drones led firemen to conclude that the roof could not be saved. So they concentrated on the bell towers and protecting works inside the cathedral with hoses. Once the spire collapsed into the nave, the firemen had to be replaced by a robot which was used to lower the temperature.Reconstruction has taken on a dual, allegorical meaning. “We are a people of builders. We have so much to reconstruct,” Mr Macron said on Tuesday night.That theme was echoed by the philosopher of aesthetics Mikael Labbé in Libération. Labbé quoted Winston Churchill regarding bomb damage at the end of the second World War: “We shape our buildings, and afterwards, our buildings shape us.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3862796.1555444212!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"notre dame rose windows among artefacts to survive blaze","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConsultant Patrick Palem checks statues removed from the spire of  Notre Dame ahead of the fire. Photograph: Regis DuvignauFour-hundred-year-old paintings hung high inside Notre Dame were damaged by the immense fire that engulfed the Paris cathedral, but emergency workers formed a human chain to take gem-studded chalices and other priceless artefacts out of harm’s way.Notre Dame’s famed stained-glass rose windows and most of its many religious relics appeared to have escaped the worst of Monday’s inferno as well, easing fears for the fate of the vast trove of artworks in the 800-year-old Gothic cathedral.Among the most cherished articles to make it out unscathed was the Sainte Couronne (holy crown), made of braided reed brought to France from Constantinople in the 12th century. Though lacking its original thorns, the crown has been revered as an object of Christian worship for centuries.Gold, silver and gem-inlaid chalices, candelabras and many other artefacts survived the blaze thanks to quick-thinking firefighters, police and city employees who formed a human chain to move revered artefacts away from the flames.Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo tweeted a picture of heavy-set candlesticks stacked in the safety of nearby Paris City Hall.Art specialists were still poring over the extent of the damage to Notre Dame’s 13th-century south rose window, measuring 10m across, and other stained-glass masterpieces still standing after the cathedral’s wood-beamed roof collapsed.Smoke damage“It seems they have not been destroyed for now, although we’ll have to see what real state they’re in, and whether they can be restored properly,” said Maxime Cumunel, secretary general of France’s Observatory for Religious Heritage.“We have avoided a complete disaster. But some 5-10 per cent of the artwork has probably been destroyed, we have to face up to that,” Mr Cumunel said. Four of the largest-scale 17th- and 18th-century paintings depicting scenes from the lives of the apostles had been damaged, at least in part, he added.Culture minister Franck Riester said the paintings were mainly affected by smoke damage, rather than by flames.The artworks, which were dampened during the 15-hour battle to douse the blaze, will be removed from Friday and transferred to the Louvre museum, where other objects will also be kept, for attempts at restoration, he added.“What’s happened is really disturbing and makes me quake,” said Veronique Proust, a specialist guide who has led tours of the cathedral and its treasury for a quarter century. “For 25 years I’ve shown these treasures, the exceptional quality of the stone carvings. Now I’ve got nothing to show anymore.”Sacramental artefactsMost of the sacramental artefacts in Notre Dame’s treasury – where they were traditionally kept as reserves to be sold off or melted down in times of need – date from the 19th and 20th centuries.It was not immediately clear how much Notre Dame’s treasures were worth, with Mr Riester only pointing to the many “years and hundreds of millions” of euro of investment that would be required to restore the cathedral.Other relics that made it out of the wreckage included a tunic worn by Saint Louis, a 13th-century king of France, while the cathedral’s 13-tonne bell, its largest, which rings sonorously on special occasions like Easter, was spared.Sixteen bronze statues that adorned Notre-Dame’s collapsed spire – itself a 19th-century restoration – were airlifted out just days before the fire as part of ongoing renovations. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3861204.1555348190!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"political movement beckons as syria parties jockey over settlement talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChildren receive treatment after a gas attack on al-Shifunieh village, eastern Ghouta, Syria, on  February 25th, 2018.

For nearly eight years Syrians braved bombs and checkpoints to travel to the capital, and since the guns fell silent on most fronts they continue to arrive.Syrians living under government, jihadi, rebel, and, now, US-backed Kurdish rule, come to Damascus to access medical treatment and obtain official documents before returning home.Regardless of whoever is in power, Damascus has always been the core of Syrian identity and legitimacy. This is why the government has fiercely defended the capital and given it priority over all other cities, notably Aleppo, once Syria’s largest city and commercial hub.The government’s tight grip on Damascus gives it a major national, political, and psychological advantage over the exiled opposition. Even during the days when insurgent groups occupied capital suburbs and sectors of Aleppo, Homs, Deraa and Deir al-Zor, the government took a hard line in UN-mediated negotiations because it held Damascus.Now that the government also controls two-thirds of Syria’s territory and administers 85 per cent of the 18 million Syrians remaining in the country, it con- tinues to resist concessions. The expatriate opposition supported by the West, Saudi Arabia and Turkey cannot compete with the authority that possession of Damascus gives the government – albeit with the support of Russia and Iran.Nevertheless, sources involved in the off-and-on again negotiations for a political settlement tell The  there is movement. An expatriate civil society source involved in talks says the government has taken “little incremental steps” toward a transition over the last year.Refugee returnPro-government armed groups have been drafted into the state security apparatus while the government has absorbed ad hoc administrative entities into state structures. Gradual refugee return has been organised under Russian auspices and the government has published a list of all detainees and disappeared persons, the source said.Efforts now focus on the formation of a constitutional commission consisting of representatives of the government and opposition groups.The appointment as UN mediator of Geir Pedersen, a former Norwegian diplomat, is considered a positive development. Following meetings with Syrian foreign minister Walid Muallem at the weekend, Pedersen said, “We have had detailed substantial discussions. We are now addressing all the issues, so all the issues are on the table.”This was his third visit since assuming the post in January. His predecessor, Staffan de Mistura, had not been welcome in Damascus for two years.“The sides are engaging and they are close to establishing a 150-member constitutional commission,” states Sawsan Zakzak, a member of the Women’s Advisory Board. All Syrian parties except the Kurds – excluded at Turkey’s insistence – are to be represented on the commission – government, opposition, and civil society, she says. Once this is formed she hopes intra-Syrian talks will resume in Geneva. “The commission will choose or elect a technical committee of 18-20 to draft the document.”The Women’s Advisory Board was created in 2016 by de Mistura to represent women from Syria and the diaspora. The board originally had 12 members but now has seven from Syria and 10 from outside.Ms Zakzak says the technical committee will first have to decide whether to amend the 2011 constitution or draft a new one. The presence of a third party – civil society groups – is essential, she argues, because the “government and opposition consider each other to be enemies”.She points out that the constitution will have to define the powers of the presi- dent and parliament, the role of religion and the status of women, and guarantee freedom of speech. All these issues are highly controversial.Meanwhile, the Kurds have dropped demands for autonomy and the transformation of Syria from a unitary state into a federation. They are now asking to retain their paramilitary force and control over Kurdish towns and cities they administer in the northern Hasakah and Raqqa provinces.Separate dealsWith US support, the Kurds control 25 per cent of Syria, but they account for only 30 per cent of the population in this area. Since the Arabs do not want to be ruled by Kurds, tribesmen have been making separate deals with the government. The Kurds can be expected to follow suit once the Trump administration decides whether and when to withdraw its 2,200 troops from the northeast.An informant from Hasakah province tells The , “American, British, French, German, Saudi and Emirati” troops are based there. The recently deployed Arab contingents give the US-led anti-Islamic State coalition an Arab face but the mix of forces complicates the situation in these provinces.The Syrian army remains determined to recapture northwestern Idlib province, occupied by al-Qaeda’s Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and jihadi allies, although Russia and Turkey have compelled Damascus to postpone an all-out offensive since Idlib has 3 million residents, half of them displaced persons.Read full coverage of events here"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3863559.1555511883!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"far from swinging left or right european voters are confused","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tItaly’s deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League party, Matteo Salvini:  scornful of the “buonista”. Photograph: Federico BerniniBloombergNotes from the campaign trail: with the European Parliament election campaign now well under way across the EU ahead of next month’s voting, allow me a few unrelated reflections on what it all means:A fascinating study from the European Council on Foreign Relations of the ideas dominating the election in 14 member states (Ireland not included), titled “What Europeans Really Want: Five Myths Debunked”, finds an unparalleled degree of volatility rather than the dramatic shift to the populist right often spoken of.In fact, an ECFRYouGov poll reveals the “defining feature of the political landscape is volatility”. Voters, the study says, “have not yet made up their minds. And there are no fewer than 97 million of these confused and undecided voters . . . Between 15 and 30 per cent of all electors do not have any preference yet and between 30 and 50 per cent of these undecideds will probably vote.”And, although European elections are\u0026nbsptraditionally largely preoccupied with national issues, the report also says “this could be the first truly transnational European Parliament election”.According to one of the report’s authors, Mark Leonard: “Rather than a gravitating to the extremes, the European electorate are confused . . . moving in every direction, between the right and the left, and from the populists to the mainstream.“In this fluid environment there is a real opportunity for mainstream parties to reconnect with voters” if they can “recast themselves as bold reformers”.Digital zeal Eager to demonstrate that the company is willing to tackle outside interference online in the elections, Facebook, in an excess of zeal, has walked itself into trouble.Its well-meaning new advertising rules require all advertisers to register in the country where they wish to purchase advertising, as part of an effort to limit foreign influence in the national campaigns.But a letter of complaint from the three main EU institutions warns of “huge political and institutional consequences” of curbs to transnational campaigning.\u0026nbspThe new rules are not suited to the European election system, the letter says, as they prevent parties and institutions from running legitimate cross-border campaigns within the EU.It is addressed to Facebook’s head of global policy, Nick Clegg, and signed by secretary-general of the European Commission Martin Selmayr and his counterparts from the European Parliament and Council of the European Union.Representatives from European parties echo the frustration about the rules, which are being rolled out in Europe after having been used in the United States during midterm elections. “Facebook is blocking a pan-European conversation and hindering dialogue between European parties and citizens,”\u0026nbspDara Murphy, the Fine Gael TD and European People’s Party campaign director complained to Politico.The issue highlights the challenge also faced controlling unacceptable online speech by means of voluntary codes of conduct such as those of the EU. While campaigners welcome the new engagement of the digital giants in taking down unacceptable content, some are fearful they will have a commercial interest in over-restricting content. Safer than sorry.We need a discussion on how civic society and independent external voices can be engaged in moderating decisions by the digital giants on acceptable and unacceptable content.Tarnishing do-goodersAnd talking of excesses of zeal, I note from the New York Times that in recent years a new term has insinuated its way in Italy firmly into the lexicon of political invective: “buonista”, or “do-gooder”, favoured repeatedly most recently by deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League party, Matteo Salvini. He uses it most often against those willing to publicly back a more enlightened attitude to migrants and has even described French president Emmanuel Macron in such a vein. Disparagingly, of course.It is a curious insult, suggesting that an excess of virtue and zeal in an opponent is to be deplored or looked down on. Or, as commentator Luca Sofri once put it, “An alibi for the bad guys to be bad: if you do good then you are a do-gooder.”“The European dream is being buried by the bureaucrats, the do-gooders and the bankers who are governing Europe for too much time,” Salvini railed last week at a rally to introduce a new pan-European alliance of far-right and populist parties for the elections.The term has also become popular with Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland, which has described opponents as “Gutmensch”. A jury of linguists and writers\u0026nbspchose it as the worst word– or “unwort” – of the year in 2015. Its pejorative use for those “who oppose attacks on refugee homes”, the jury wrote, showed that “tolerance and helpfulness are generally defamed as naïve, stupid and unworldly”.But it hasn’t hit the Irish political landscape yet.

Alongside, we have also grown to appreciate the breadth of issues and opportunity that we, together with our growing team, are now responsible for.Today, as one of Scotland’s largest landowners, that responsibility has evolved to become a labour of love a project that we are deeply passionate about. It is a project that we know cannot be realised in our lifetime, which will bear fruit not just for our own children but also for the generations of visitors who, like us, hold a deep affection the Scottish Highlands.It’s a significant and lifelong commitment that we have made – not just for ourselves but for the Scottish people and Scottish nature too – a commitment which we believe in deeply.”The couple, who have been building their Scottish portfolio since 2006, are also restoring the lodges and properties on the estates.Last month, the Scottish Land Commission proposed radical reforms to SNP ministers that could see wealthy iniduals being required in future to produce a management plan before being allowed to buy estates.Andy Wightman believes landowners should have to seek consent for their estate plansAndy Wightman, the Green MSP and veteran land reform campaigner, said he believed, as a matter of principle, that “nobody should be allowed to buy 220,000 acres, no questions asked”.But he added that, after campaigning on Glenfeshie estate since 1982, he was pleased that “at last someone is doing the right thing”.He said: “The problem is, anybody from anywhere can buy as much as they like, but they may or may not do the right thing, and what the right thing is, is contested.“What we should have, and this is what the Land Commission was taking about, is that in places like Glenfeshie that are an important part of the natural heritage and have been vandalised over decades, any purchaser should have to seek some consent for their plans.”Mr Wightman added: “If there are billionaires willing to come and restore landscapes in Scotland, according to what is the public policy of the time, then far rather they come with their money than us spend public money. That is a rational, pragmatic view of what he’s doing.”He said there were long-standing restrictions on what landowners could do with scheduled monuments, such as standing stones, and suggested a similar approach should be established for Scotland’s natural heritage.Highlands and IslandsPlease review our commenting policyNorth Korea test-fires new tactical guided weapon in message to US over talksMan charged after police officers sprayed with ammoniaMadeira bus crash: 29 people dead after tourist coach overturns on Portuguese islandBritain\u0026#39s first pet rabbits were kept by the Romans, new Historic England discovery findsParents caring for sick children warned against sharing stories on social media in wake of Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans casesFrance invites designs for new spire to grace Notre-DameChimerica, episode 1, review: At last, a bold geopolitical thriller with brainsEarth from Space, episode 1, review: the astonishing money shots of life from on highMacron plans to shut elite school for future leadersCBBC star Mya-Lecia Naylor dies aged 16: Emily Atack leads tributes to \u0026#39beautiful and talented\u0026#39 actressComment: Corbyn\u0026#39s polling lead is a national emergency.

It also had bone morphology suggesting it wasn’t wild, and so may have been kept in confinement as a pet.Dr Worley said: “I was excited to find a rabbit bone from a Roman deposit, and thrilled when the radiocarbon date confirmed that it isn\u0027t from a modern rabbit that had burrowed in.“This find will change how we interpret Roman remains and highlights that new information awaits discovery in museum collections.”Professor Naomi Sykes, from the University of Exeter, who also helped with the research, said: “The bone fragment was very small, meaning it was overlooked for decades, and modern research techniques mean we can learn about its date and genetic background as well.”Please review our commenting policyNorth Korea test-fires new tactical guided weapon in message to US over talksMan charged after police officers sprayed with ammoniaMadeira bus crash: 29 people dead after tourist coach overturns on Portuguese islandParents caring for sick children warned against sharing stories on social media in wake of Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans casesBritain\u0026#39s biggest private landowner says re-wilding Scotland is a \u0026#39labour of love\u0026#39France invites designs for new spire to grace Notre-DameChimerica, episode 1, review: At last, a bold geopolitical thriller with brainsEarth from Space, episode 1, review: the astonishing money shots of life from on highMacron plans to shut elite school for future leadersCBBC star Mya-Lecia Naylor dies aged 16: Emily Atack leads tributes to \u0026#39beautiful and talented\u0026#39 actressComment: Corbyn\u0026#39s polling lead is a national emergency.

Parents were asked to report the total amount of time that three-year old children spent looking at television screens and gaming and mobile devices. They then completed a behaviour checklist and their behaviour in school at age five.The average three year old was found to be spending 90 minutes a day looking at screens, the study by the University of Alberta found. The one in seven who watched more than two hours had a 7.7-fold increased risk of meeting criteria for ADHD, the study published in the journal PLOS ONE found.The study found that children who spent more time doing organised sports were less likely to exhibit behavioural problems.Study leader Professor Piush Mandhane, a paediatrician, said: We found screen time had a significant impact at five years of age.”Recently England’s chief medical officer urged parents not to allow children to spend more than two hours at a time looking at screens.Dame Sally Davies also said smartphones should be banned from meal times and left outside of bedrooms at night. Prof Mandhane said the new findings suggested screen time should be far more limited for pre-school children. He said: Our data suggests between zero and 30 minutes a day is the optimal amount of screen time.The preschool period is an ideal time for education on healthy relationships with screens, and we believe our data shows that you can\u0027t start too early.The research identified factors that provided protection from the negative effects of screen time.Good quality sleep had a small impact, while participation in organised sports was found to have a highly significant protective effect.Prof Mandhane said: Interestingly, it wasn\u0027t physical activity on its own that was protective the activity needed to have structure.And the more time children spent doing organised sports, the less likely they were to exhibit behavioural problems.Fellow author Sukhpreet Tamana said: A lot of the things you do through organised activities are really important for young kids early on. It sets the stage for development amongst children.I think in lieu of screen time, it would be beneficial for parents to increase opportunities for other structured activities instead.Please review our commenting policyNorth Korea test-fires new tactical guided weapon in message to US over talksMan charged after police officers sprayed with ammoniaMadeira bus crash: 29 people dead after tourist coach overturns on Portuguese islandBritain\u0026#39s first pet rabbits were kept by the Romans, new Historic England discovery findsParents caring for sick children warned against sharing stories on social media in wake of Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans casesBritain\u0026#39s biggest private landowner says re-wilding Scotland is a \u0026#39labour of love\u0026#39France invites designs for new spire to grace Notre-DameChimerica, episode 1, review: At last, a bold geopolitical thriller with brainsEarth from Space, episode 1, review: the astonishing money shots of life from on highMacron plans to shut elite school for future leadersCBBC star Mya-Lecia Naylor dies aged 16: Emily Atack leads tributes to \u0026#39beautiful and talented\u0026#39 actressComment: Corbyn\u0026#39s polling lead is a national emergency.

The launch of the contest came as it transpired that firefighters lost valuable time in tackling the fire after a computer glitch sent investigators to the wrong part of the cathedral, according to French reports.An initial fire alarm sounded at 6.20pm local time but after failing to find a blaze, security services at the landmark dubbed it a false alarm.  At 6.43pm, almost 25 minutes later, a second alarm went off.Only when they returned to the upper area of the edifice did they call in firefighters, after coming across three-metre flames at the base of the spire. According to Le Parisien, the computer glitch had caused the alarm to signal the wrong location.  Police are investigating the possibility that the fire was the result of a short-circuit in a restoration workers’ lift. Despite the delay, firemen were on the scene within ten minutes.A few more and the entire edifice would have burned to the ground in a chain-reaction collapse, a French government official said on Wednesday.Notre-Dame cathedral fire aftermath, in picturesThe firefighters took aggressive action to protect wooden supports in the twin medieval bell towers from the flames, averting a bigger catastrophe, said Jose Vaz de Matos, a fire expert with France\u0027s culture ministry.If the fire reached this wooden structure, the bell tower would have been lost, said Mr De Matos. ”From the moment we lose the war of the bell towers, we lose the cathedral, because it\u0027s a chain-reaction collapse.On Wednesday, Edouard Philippe, the prime minister launched an international architecture contest to decide how the partly 850-year old monument should be rebuilt - a “huge and historic undertaking that President Emmanuel Macron says he wants to be completed “within five years” - in time for the 2024 Paris Olympics.The devastating fire burned down the Gothic masterpiece’s roof, ancient wooden beams and 19th-century spire and sparking global offers of condolence and support.Mr Philippe said: ”The international contest will settle the question of whether we should build a new spire, whether we should rebuild the spire that was designed and built by (Eugene) Viollet-Le-Duc, in identical fashion, or whether we should... endow Notre-Dame cathedral with a new spire adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era.”Benjamin Mouton, Notre-Dame\u0027s former affiliated architect between, said it was pointless seeking to restore a building that has already been heavily altered, modified and reinforced.On the other hand, we must recreate the cathedral\u0027s silhouette and rebuild the spire. That to me is indispensable,” he told Reuters.French President Emmanuel Macron speaks with French government\u0026#39s representative for heritage Stephane BernOn Tuesday evening, Mr Macron pledged to restore the landmark that took nearly two centuries to build in record time.We will rebuild the cathedral even more beautifully and I want it to be finished within five years, he told the nation.Some experts, however, suggest it could take “decades” notably to replace the precious oak forest that propped up the roof, while the rector said it would be shut “for at least six years”.The government has named a former five-star general, Jean-Louis Georgelin, to oversee the race against the clock to wind up the work before France hosts the Olympic Games in 2024.    Despite the devastation, much of the cathedral, including its famed bell towers, remains intact. To the delight of the French public, the metal cockerel that perched on the top of Notre-Dame\u0027s spire has now been retrieved in the rubble - and appears to have been spared the worst of the fire.“It is dented but properly restorable,” a ministry of culture spokesman said of the rooster, which contains three relics that may also have survived the blaze.Stored inside the rooster is one relic of St Denis, one of St Genevieve and one of the thorns from the crown that Jesus Christ is believed to have worn at the Crucifixion.Their condition is unknown. The rooster has served as a spiritual lightning rod for Notre-Dame, according to the cathedral\u0027s website.The rooster was found by a worker at the siteIt is not the only priceless artefact to have been rescued from the flames of Notre-Dame. Fire brigade chaplain Jean-Marc Fournier has been declared a national hero after he rushed into the burning cathedral to rescue the Crown of Thorns and the Blessed Sacraments. The cathedral’s most famous circular stained-glass windows are in “good condition” according to lieutenant-colonel Gabriel Plus, a spokesman for the Paris fire brigade. While there was “no risk of collapse” of the building, he said the rose windows’ support structures were still at risk after their lead joints partly melted in the intense heat.“There is a risk for the gables that are no longer supported by the frame,” he said. He also said that all the paintings that were left on the walls during the fire were intact but covered in soot.The floor of the nave remains strewn with blackened roof beams and chunks of the collapsed upper vaulting.While police are treating the blaze as an accident, they have already spoken to around 50 people from five different construction companies. Public prosecutor Remy Heitz has said the investigation threatened to be long and complex”.Tributes and words of support continued to stream in from around the world yesterday as the bells of cathedrals around France rang out to mark the exact moment when the fire started on Monday.Theresa May also announced that bells would be rung at churches and cathedrals across England in solidarity with France. Please review our commenting policyNorth Korea test-fires new tactical guided weapon in message to US over talksMan charged after police officers sprayed with ammoniaMadeira bus crash: 29 people dead after tourist coach overturns on Portuguese islandBritain\u0026#39s first pet rabbits were kept by the Romans, new Historic England discovery findsParents caring for sick children warned against sharing stories on social media in wake of Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans casesBritain\u0026#39s biggest private landowner says re-wilding Scotland is a \u0026#39labour of love\u0026#39Chimerica, episode 1, review: At last, a bold geopolitical thriller with brainsEarth from Space, episode 1, review: the astonishing money shots of life from on highMacron plans to shut elite school for future leadersCBBC star Mya-Lecia Naylor dies aged 16: Emily Atack leads tributes to \u0026#39beautiful and talented\u0026#39 actressComment: Corbyn\u0026#39s polling lead is a national emergency.

He had even recorded the speech. But minutes after it was in the can, Notre-Dame Cathedral went up in flames, prompting the 41-year old centrist to cancel the broadcast and rush to the site of France’s beloved 850-year old monument.The text of the speech has already been leaked widely to French media. In one of the most eye-catching proposals, the president proposes scrapping the elite ENA college in Paris for senior public servants of which he, along with many of France’s former presidents, is a graduate. The school is supposed to be a meritocratic hothouse, but critics say it fails to attract a social mix and creates a culture of cronyism among France’s elite. David Guilbaud, a graduate and author of The Meritocratic Illusion, called the proposal “a very good PR stunt but which in no way solves the problem of training top civil servants nor that of social inequalities in entering the senior civil service.Among the most explosive ideas is to ask the French to “work more” by reducing the number of national holidays, doing away with the 35-hour week or increasing the legal retirement age.Philippe Martinez, head of the hardline leftist CGT union slammed the idea as absurd.The future is working less. If we want everyone to work, people need to work less, he claimed. Mr Macron also pledges to lower taxes on the middle classes - a measure he says he will pay for by cracking down on tax evasion.He promises a review in 2020 of his deeply unpopular decision to cut a wealth tax - a move that saw critics dub him “president of the rich”.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

A rise\u0026nbspwould help to lower inflation but would mean extra costs for borrowers and could act to slow economic growth.The consumer price index (CPI), including owner-occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH) – the Office for National Statistics’\u0026nbsppreferred measure of inflation – was 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspin March, unchanged from February.The retail price\u0026nbspindex (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, was unchanged from February at 2.4 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000. Scotland registered a decline of 0.2 per cent to reach £146,000 on average.The lowest average house prices are in the North East at £125,000 and is the only English region where house prices remain below their peak reached before the financial crisis.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club said the figures “very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties.\u0026nbsp“Although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East“.He predicted a 1 per cent rise for the coming year but said he “would not be at all surprised” if they stagnate.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The remarks come as a mother of an autistic child who tried to take her own life in an isolation booth at an academy school is threatening legal action against the government.The girl, who has autistic spectrum disorder, was put in isolation by her school in Kent for more than a month, where she was forced to remain silent and had no directed teaching.Anna Wolmuth, from Islington, said: “We have heard horror stories from across the country. Children being made to cry in assemblies. Children spending six hours a \u0026nbspday in isolation booths.”Last year, a BBC investigation revealed that around 5,000 children with special educational needs\u0026nbspattended isolation rooms in 2018 – and more than 200 children were placed in isolation booths for a whole week. School pupil attempted suicide after being in isolation for a monthAt her former school, Ms Wolmuth said the referral room was filled with children with special educational needs and “those with difficult things going on at home.She added: “This is when behaviour management is a euphemism for child abuse.”The motion, which was passed by NEU members, describes zero tolerance approaches as “inhumane”, adding they have led to informal exclusions and children spending “harmful” periods in isolation. Carole Buxton, a teacher from Hackney, said: “Zero tolerance approaches are isive, damaging and wrong. They are one of the causes of exclusions, putting children out of the education system.”The motion added: “The use of isolation booths for extended periods has a detrimental effect on the mental health and education of all children.”The debate came as a survey revealed that more than four in five teachers had seen a rise in mental health problems among pupils, with some children as young as nine talking about suicides.Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “The current draconian approach to the education of children and young people is turning our schools into exam factories and squeezing the joy and creativity out of the classroom. “As a result, more and more children and young people are being diagnosed with depression and the levels of unhappiness are soaring.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And Sats for Year 6 pupils are here to stay.Labour will abolish Sats exams in primary schools, Jeremy Corbyn saysIn fact, children in primary schools will also face a times-tables check next year on top of the already unpopular phonics tests under the government’s assessment system.So why do the controversial primary school tests still exist? Nick Gibb, the schools minister, argues that the exams raise standards and improve children’s reading and maths before secondary school.Ministers say that pressure shouldn\u0027t be\u0026nbspplaced on\u0026nbspchildren\u0026nbspas the exams are there only\u0026nbspto measure schools.Created with Sketch.Back to school: children attend class around the world Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A student stands in the ruins of one of his former classroomsUnicefClarke for UNSitan Doumbia, 5, plays with her friends at the Early Childhood Development Center in Mali330 Democratic Republic of the CongoTeacher Edouard Kabukapua, 28, accompanies his students as they sing on their way to their class in a temporary tent school in Mulombela village, KasaÃ¯ region, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

And the pressure has been passed down to the kids.Some argue that abolishing Sats would also make it harder for parents to know how good schools are at teaching core subjects, with these\u0026nbspresults used in league tables and Ofsted ratings.However, many parents are willing to have less information in order to save their child from the tougher assessments that leave many feeling stressed out.Standing up in front of teachers\u0026nbspwho have been disillusioned with the primary school testing regime for years\u0026nbspand calling for the abolition of exams\u0026nbspis an easy gig for Corbyn. What will be harder is finding an alternative assessment system that both parents and schools will back.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience.

Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.The increasing competition has seen Disney pull its own programming,\u0026nbspincluding the Marvel television shows, from Netflix.Disney has a huge back catalogue and plans to launch its own streaming service on 12 November in the US priced at $7 a month – about £5.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalIt is not uncommon for rogue space debris to collide with Earth, with tons of cosmic material passing through the atmosphere every day.The vast majority burns up before it reaches the ground, but every decade or so a larger asteroid collides with Earth.Pepsi considers space billboards to project logo across night skyIn 2013, an asteroid 20m in diameter entered the Earth’s atmosphere over the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia, causing a massive explosion.A subsequent study calculated it released more than 30 times the explosive energy of the Hiroshima bomb, contributing to more than 1,500 people in the local area seeking medical treatment.“If humanity does not want to go the way of the dinosaurs, we need to study an event like this in detail,” Professor Qing-Zhu Yin of the University of California said at the time.“Chelyabinsk serves as a unique calibration point for high-energy meteorite impact events for our future studies.”But due to their relatively tiny size, asteroids are notoriously difficult to spot and often go undetected until a few days before they are due to pass or collide with Earth.Chelyabinsk meteorite in the ice of Lake Chebarkul (PA)Astronomers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory recently described it as like spotting a lump of coal in the night’s sky.\u0026nbsp“If we find an object only a few days from impact, it greatly limits our choices, so in our search efforts we’ve focussed on finding NEOs\u0026nbspwhen they are further away from Earth, providing a maximum amount of time and opening up a wider range of mitigation possibilities.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The executives also claimed a “new, easier reporting process” meant three-times more abusive accounts had been suspended and 2.5-times more private information had been removed.Twitter first revealed the new ‘hide replies’ feature earlier this year, claiming it would help “empower” users to make their conversations “as healthy as possible”.Critics of the new feature say it will stifle legitimate reaction to controversial tweets made by public figures, as comments to any egregious remarks could be automatically hidden.Twitter boss Jack Dorsey buying $10,000 in bitcoin each weekTwitter users will still be able to view the replies but only if they click or tap to expand the conversation.“Free speech be damned, it’ll be great for seeing the world thru rose coloured glasses,” one Twitter user tweeted in March.Twitter’s senior product manager Yasmeen Haq responded at the time by saying the “hide replies”\u0026nbspfeature was not intended to stifle conversations but protect users.“We think the transparency of the hidden replies would allow the community to notice and call out situations where people use the feature to hide content they disagree with,” she said.“We think this can balance the product experience between the original tweeter and the audience.”Other new changes to Twitter that will be introduced as part of the update include improved technology to help review content faster, as well as new rules designed to be easier to understand.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She has since been caring full-time for her two children, one of whom has severe autism.In October 2018, the US national travelled to America for two weeks due to the father being ill. On her return, she was told she had no right to enter, and days later\u0026nbspshe received a notice from the Home Office stating that there was a ticket booked for her removal the following Thursday morning.Speaking to The Independent, Ms Cullen said: “I was just panicking because I couldn’t even\u0026nbspcontact a barrister over the weekend. My children would’ve gone into care because my husband was out of the country at the time. I was living like there was no tomorrow. It felt like everything was falling apart.“They said that if I didn’t board the flight I’d be arrested where I lived and forcibly removed. We were making preparations with social services and school. My children would have been devastated. This is the life that they know.”Ms Cullen’s barrister successfully sought an emergency injunction on the grounds that the department had failed to consider the welfare of her children\u0026nbspin breach of UK law.Despite this, and the fact that she\u0026nbspwas granted a British residence card in January, Ms Cullen is still on immigration bail, and the Home Office still has her passport.\u0026nbsp“I felt like I was finally getting over it, that the judge said I could stay. It just doesn’t make sense. They’ve agreed that I do have the right to be here. It’s like I’m allowed to be here but not allowed to leave,“\u0026nbspsaid Ms Cullen. “It’s baffling really that they don’t seem to consider any human part of this. I feel like I’m just a number. They wanted to protect the border by tearing a mother from her children.“My mother is starting to forget who I am because I’m not there. I just feel lost. This time is precious and they’re taking that from me.”Ms Cullen’s solicitor Arta Heath, managing director of MyUKVisas, said the Home Office’s attempt to deport the mother-of-two\u0026nbspwas “absolutely outrageous”.She said the\u0026nbsppassport issue was a\u0026nbspsymptom of both the hostile environment and “complete incompetence” in the department.Most immigration removals cancelled amid ‘dearth of legal advice’“This is a terrible situation. The Home Office said it knew she had British citizen children but that they could stay with their father, which is absolutely outrageous. They claimed that because had spent two weeks without their mum they could be without her forever,” said Ms Heath.“But the issue now is the administrative process.\u0026nbspThere is no reason for them to hold onto her passport, but they haven’t sent it to her and the removal direction process is still continuing, meaning she can’t go see her mum.“It shows how the inability of the Home Office to understand law and procedure, coupled with the hostile environment, is leading to shocking decisions being made.”Responding to the case, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: “It seems the Home Office have ignored what is humane and sensible. Instead they have continued with the tick-box exercises, which have characterised this Tory government’s hostile environment.\u0026nbsp“Until these dreadful policies end, families will live with the threat of being torn apart.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of the so called \u0027Red Brigade\u0027 march in disobedience on the street from Oxford Circus to Piccadilly Circus to protest in London.

Counterterror officers are investigating the three devices as linked following a series of evacuations. One of the packages opened by office staff at Heathrow Airport burst into flames. Scotland Yard did not rule out the existence of other bombs. “The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices,” a spokesperson said. “These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened. “The Met Police Counter Terrorism Command is treating the incidents as a linked series and is keeping an open mind regarding motives.”Large waves crash over the sea walls at Cleveleys near Blackpool, as the remains of Storm Freya, which has battered Britain with gales, heavy rain and snow causes widespread travel disruptionChristopher Hepworth with partner Tanisha Prince (right) on their way to victory in the annual UK Wife Carrying Race at The Nower in Dorking, SurreyPolice officers search near the scene on St Neot\u0027s Road in Harold Hill, east London following the fatal stabbing of a 17-year-old girl on Friday night.

From the mid-19th century, iron mining fundamentally altered Western Cumbria and the Furness peninsular, making a significant contribution to the national economy. However, site clearances following industrial decline in the second half of the 20th century, has left few surviving remains of the industry. Florence Mine is believed to have been the last iron mine to close in Europe and was last worked in 2007. Hematite iron ore from the mine is used for the pigment Egremont Red, still found in some lipsticks today.234 University of York, Campus West designed landscape. Heslington, YorkThe University of York Campus West designed landscape was laid out from 1963-1980 It is a high-quality post-war university landscape that fulfils the architects’ masterplan vision of creating a town in miniature with a pedestrianised environment. One of the key features of the landscape is the lake, which has two small islands, a courtyard pool and a fountain which form a central focal point at the heart of the campus. Offering bursts of green against the surrounding concrete structures are the lake features, reed beds and lily pads, which were introduced to improve water purity. The landscape is relatively unaltered since it was laid out and the design successfully integrates the new landscape with the historic Heslington Hall gardens. It was designed by distinguished mid-20th century architects Andrew Derbyshire and Maurice Lee of RMJM with Frank Clark, the co-founders of the Garden History Society (now The Garden Trust).334 University of York, Campus West designed landscape.

It is here that they made 17 gallon galvanised iron containers, designed for transporting milk by rail. The company was heavily associated with George Barnham, who invented the containers and went on to become chair of the British Dairy Farmers Association, Mayor of Hampstead and High Sheriff of Middlesex and was knighted in 1904.Travellers on the East Coast Main Line north of York typically pass the former Otterington Railway Station at over 100 miles per hour. This station building with its signal box was built by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1932 as a replacement for the Victorian station that had been cleared away to allow the expansion of the line to four tracks. 634 University of York, Central Hall. Heslington, YorkThe University of York was one of seven new universities founded in England between 1958 and 1961. Central Hall is the centrepiece of the University’s western campus and has a striking and bold design. The exceptionally detailed development plan behind the campus was heralded as the beginning of contemporary university planning in Britain. The building is a concrete structure with a suspended mild steel tubular roof clad in aluminium, with the upper floors, where the auditorium is located, cantilevered out on the lake sides. It continues a historic tradition established by late 19th century and early 20th century ‘red brick’ universities in featuring a great hall for special events.734 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade. South LondonThe Crystal Palace subway, vestibule, terrace and stairs provide an elaborate pedestrian passageway, with finely-crafted Byzantine-style vaulting in red and cream brick and chequered floors in alternating stone. The structure dates from 1865 and was built to link a new train station directly to the entrance of the Crystal Palace. Designed by highly-accomplished architect Charles Barry Junior, the quality of construction is excellent. It is an architecturally imaginative solution to the problem of transporting visitors beneath Crystal Palace Parade and providing a dramatic introduction to the palace itself. 834 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade.

The thatched memorial bus shelter at Osmington in West Dorset is located on the south side of the A353 and is an important landmark in the village. It dates to around the 1940s and was built by Harry and Ethel Parry-Jones in memory of their son, David, a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of The Rifle Brigade who died at the age of 20 on 3 August 1944 during the Battle of Normandy. Local materials were used including Purbeck stone and thatch which complements the bus shelter’s surroundings. Despite its vulnerability as a piece of street furniture, the bus shelter has not been significantly altered since it was first built. It demonstrates that even modest and functional structures can form eloquent and valuable memorials for their local communities.Although modest in scale, the Assembly Rooms building has great presence with its bright, red brick exterior. This charming community hall boasts an exuberant design with its late-19th century, Jacobean Revival style, terracotta tiles and stone detailing.

Pendeen, CornwallThe parish of Pendeen in Cornwall was established in 1846, and its first vicar, Reverend Robert Aitken, was tasked to provide a church for the community. Aitken was renowned for his unusual preaching style and this was deemed to be well-suited to pull people away from the dominance of Methodism in the county’s mining communities. Aitken took it upon himself to design the church, the neighbouring vicarage and school, using local materials. Many of the fixtures and fittings were also made by local craftspeople, and Aitken donated his own collection of 16th century and 17th century Flemish and German glass roundels to enhance the windows. 1334 St John the Baptist Church, boundary walls, vicarage and school.

It dates to around 1907 and originates from a pub called The Cock which was located at a junction known as The Cock Cross Roads and owned by ‘Gentleman Jackson’ (1769-1845), a celebrated English boxer who won the title ‘Champion of England.’  The Cock Sign stands at a prominent location at the junction of Sutton High Street and Carshalton Road.

Traditionally, in Northern England, Iron Age and Romano-British native settlements take a variety of forms, with enclosures being defined by a bank and a ditch. Higher status enclosures, however, were formed of stone and have now been reduced to stony earthworks, as at East Mellwaters. The site is adjacent to other prehistoric settlement remains, which are thought to represent a succession of settlement sites established over the centuries. Architects Michael and Patty Hopkins built the house as a family home in 1975-1976, which also served as their office until the early 1980s. The couple designed and constructed the house as a study in making use of the maximum, flexible space of the site and were influenced by the Eames Case Study House of 1949. The house is notable for its energy efficiency, which includes the low thermal demands of the house, sparing use of materials and Venetian blinds. The highly elegant and economic lightweight steel frame and glass building made in the High-Tech tradition, is particularly eye-catching amongst the Victorian mansions typical of Hampstead and the Regency villas that make Downshire Hill distinctive from the rest of the village. The house won an RIBA award in 1977 and a Civic Trust Award in 1979. The couple jointly won the RIBA Gold Medal in 1994 and Michael Hopkins went on to receive a knighthood for his achievements in 1995.The former office of the Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Standard. The Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Standard was founded in Malmesbury in 1837 and its production moved to Cirencester in 1840. It has continued to bring local news to the people of the two counties ever since. In 1904 the paper’s owner, George Henry Harmer, who had worked his way up through the firm from reporter to proprietor, sought to unite the printing and publishing arms of the paper on the same site for the first time, and commissioned local architect VA Lawson to design a new publishing office on a narrow site in Dyer Street, retaining the existing printing sheds to the rear. The resulting three-storey building has an imposing presence in a street of otherwise modest Cotswold buildings. It is in an Arts and Crafts style, taller than its neighbours, with jetties which project the elaborate timber-framed upper floors out over the street.In 1934, Rolls Royce leased two hangars at the Hucknall airfield, which was established in 1917, and created a testing programme there for aero engines and equipment. The building is largely intact and features many surviving fixtures dating back to the mid-20th century, including an engine-testing control panel, observation windows, wing spar mount assembly, roller doors, pierced metal sheet lining, as well as fittings and support for a de-tuner.  The site saw many world-leading developments such as the Merlin Engine, which was tested, developed and adapted for the American Mustang fighter aircraft there. The world’s first flight of a commercial jet aircraft flew from Hucknall to the Paris Air show in the late 1940s, using Frank Whittle’s jet engine which had been developed on site.

Newcastle on Clun, ShropshireThe lych gate to the east of Church of St John the Evangelist in Newcastle on Clun dates from 1880 and forms a picturesque entrance to St John’s churchyard. The design follows the Arts and Crafts traditions, bringing together joinery, ironmongery and slate work and is inspired by medieval predecessors. The roof mimics that of the lych gate claimed to be the oldest in the country, at the Church of St George in Beckenham, Kent, originally constructed in the 13th century. Within the timber-framed passageway of the lych gate is a revolving gate, which is an unusual feature and one of only a handful in existence in England. ‘Lych’ derives from the Anglo-Saxon or German word for corpse, and is named after the structure’s primary function of storing the coffin before burial. Lych gates also serve as a meeting point and shelter for funeral parties before they are met by the priest.The fishing industry in Newlyn on the south coast of Cornwall expanded in the 1880s, resulting in the construction of a new harbour and two piers. In the early 20th century, the south pier was extended to give better protection to the harbour and a tidal observatory was built at its north end. The observatory was one of three constructed at the request of Ordnance Survey to establish Mean Sea Level.The former lifeboat house, built in 1884, was designed by CH Cooke and represents the crucial role played by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in saving lives at sea since the 19th century. Its wide gabled structure and ornamental treatment, made up of fish-scale tiling, decorative moulded brick, and a beautifully incorporated bay window, create a finely detailed and strikingly composed building.2634 Cattle Trough and Drinking Fountain. Spaniards Road, HampsteadCattle troughs were once commonplace in Britain, with the politan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association (MDFCTA) responsible for over 1000 of them. Around 500 of these were located in London, however a large number have now been lost. The trough in Spaniards Road was believed to have been erected in 1916, making it a particularly late example of its type. Although the pump and spout mechanism are missing, the cattle trough is an important reminder that horse-drawn transport was commonplace in the early 20th century, despite the increasing use of motorised transport. In providing free drinking water for horses, charities like the MDFCTA also played an important role in raising standards in animal welfare.This early 17th century gatehouse to the former Caynton Manor is a remarkable survival, previously undiscovered. Originally a formal gateway to a wealthy country house, it has been used for agricultural purposes since the 18th century. While very little is known about the house which the gatehouse served, the quality of the gatehouse signifies a substantial building of high status. It is a well-proportioned building with a red sandstone base, a tiled roof and good quality detailing, characteristic of this building type at the time it was built, around 1635. Of particular interest is the carved detailing around the archways and the elaborate plasterwork in the principal rooms inside the gatehouse. This listing means that it can now be assessed for inclusion on Historic England’s Heritage at Risk Register, which would enable Historic England to offer specialist technical advice to help secure its future.This early 17th century gatehouse to the former Caynton Manor is a remarkable survival, previously undiscovered.

Chipping Camden, Gloucestershire The garden at Kingcombe complements Grade II listed Kingcombe House. It is an increasingly rare survival of an Arts and Crafts garden laid out in the 1930s. The pre-war garden is well-preserved and is an impressive and thoughtful design which includes Italian influences in the terraced garden including Italian steps to ide it from the more functional parts of the garden and to provide a vertical link from the top of the terraces to the meadow beyond the garden. Intact gardens dating from the 1930s are rare in England. It was designed initially by Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe and Russell Page with Sir Gordon Russell between 1927 and 1936 with later additions by Sir Gordon Russell from the 1940s through to the 1970s. During the Second World War and the austerity years that followed, few private houses were built so commissions for new gardens were few and far between.3034 Garden at Kingcombe.

Castle Place, NottinghamAcclaimed sculptor and Nottingham native, James Arthur Woodford RA OBE was commissioned to craft this imaginative group of sculptures, depicting the legendary characters of Robin Hood and his Merry Men, to commemorate the visit of their Royal Highnesses the Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh for the city’s quincentenary celebrations in 1949. Woodford conceived the group of sculptures to occupy the land in the outer ditch of Nottingham Castle, the setting of one of the most popular legendary tales of Robin Hood. 3234 Robin Hood and his Merry Men.

Cappleside Barn in Ribblesdale, North Yorkshire was built in 1714. It is a large barn with a remarkable ornamental roof structure with carefully shaped timbers that also include carved motifs such as ‘daisy-wheels’. At first, Historic England thought that these roof timbers had been reused from a high-status medieval house, but dendrochronology has shown that the timbers came from trees felled shortly before the construction of the barn.

Designed by highly-accomplished architect Charles Barry Junior, the quality of construction is excellent. It is an architecturally imaginative solution to the problem of transporting visitors beneath Crystal Palace Parade and providing a dramatic introduction to the palace itself. 834 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade.

The thatched memorial bus shelter at Osmington in West Dorset is located on the south side of the A353 and is an important landmark in the village. It dates to around the 1940s and was built by Harry and Ethel Parry-Jones in memory of their son, David, a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of The Rifle Brigade who died at the age of 20 on 3 August 1944 during the Battle of Normandy. Local materials were used including Purbeck stone and thatch which complements the bus shelter’s surroundings. Despite its vulnerability as a piece of street furniture, the bus shelter has not been significantly altered since it was first built. It demonstrates that even modest and functional structures can form eloquent and valuable memorials for their local communities.Although modest in scale, the Assembly Rooms building has great presence with its bright, red brick exterior. This charming community hall boasts an exuberant design with its late-19th century, Jacobean Revival style, terracotta tiles and stone detailing.

Pendeen, CornwallThe parish of Pendeen in Cornwall was established in 1846, and its first vicar, Reverend Robert Aitken, was tasked to provide a church for the community. Aitken was renowned for his unusual preaching style and this was deemed to be well-suited to pull people away from the dominance of Methodism in the county’s mining communities. Aitken took it upon himself to design the church, the neighbouring vicarage and school, using local materials. Many of the fixtures and fittings were also made by local craftspeople, and Aitken donated his own collection of 16th century and 17th century Flemish and German glass roundels to enhance the windows. 1334 St John the Baptist Church, boundary walls, vicarage and school.

It dates to around 1907 and originates from a pub called The Cock which was located at a junction known as The Cock Cross Roads and owned by ‘Gentleman Jackson’ (1769-1845), a celebrated English boxer who won the title ‘Champion of England.’  The Cock Sign stands at a prominent location at the junction of Sutton High Street and Carshalton Road.

Traditionally, in Northern England, Iron Age and Romano-British native settlements take a variety of forms, with enclosures being defined by a bank and a ditch. Higher status enclosures, however, were formed of stone and have now been reduced to stony earthworks, as at East Mellwaters. The site is adjacent to other prehistoric settlement remains, which are thought to represent a succession of settlement sites established over the centuries. Architects Michael and Patty Hopkins built the house as a family home in 1975-1976, which also served as their office until the early 1980s. The couple designed and constructed the house as a study in making use of the maximum, flexible space of the site and were influenced by the Eames Case Study House of 1949. The house is notable for its energy efficiency, which includes the low thermal demands of the house, sparing use of materials and Venetian blinds. The highly elegant and economic lightweight steel frame and glass building made in the High-Tech tradition, is particularly eye-catching amongst the Victorian mansions typical of Hampstead and the Regency villas that make Downshire Hill distinctive from the rest of the village. The house won an RIBA award in 1977 and a Civic Trust Award in 1979. The couple jointly won the RIBA Gold Medal in 1994 and Michael Hopkins went on to receive a knighthood for his achievements in 1995.The former office of the Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Standard. The Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Standard was founded in Malmesbury in 1837 and its production moved to Cirencester in 1840. It has continued to bring local news to the people of the two counties ever since. In 1904 the paper’s owner, George Henry Harmer, who had worked his way up through the firm from reporter to proprietor, sought to unite the printing and publishing arms of the paper on the same site for the first time, and commissioned local architect VA Lawson to design a new publishing office on a narrow site in Dyer Street, retaining the existing printing sheds to the rear. The resulting three-storey building has an imposing presence in a street of otherwise modest Cotswold buildings. It is in an Arts and Crafts style, taller than its neighbours, with jetties which project the elaborate timber-framed upper floors out over the street.In 1934, Rolls Royce leased two hangars at the Hucknall airfield, which was established in 1917, and created a testing programme there for aero engines and equipment. The building is largely intact and features many surviving fixtures dating back to the mid-20th century, including an engine-testing control panel, observation windows, wing spar mount assembly, roller doors, pierced metal sheet lining, as well as fittings and support for a de-tuner.  The site saw many world-leading developments such as the Merlin Engine, which was tested, developed and adapted for the American Mustang fighter aircraft there. The world’s first flight of a commercial jet aircraft flew from Hucknall to the Paris Air show in the late 1940s, using Frank Whittle’s jet engine which had been developed on site.

Newcastle on Clun, ShropshireThe lych gate to the east of Church of St John the Evangelist in Newcastle on Clun dates from 1880 and forms a picturesque entrance to St John’s churchyard. The design follows the Arts and Crafts traditions, bringing together joinery, ironmongery and slate work and is inspired by medieval predecessors. The roof mimics that of the lych gate claimed to be the oldest in the country, at the Church of St George in Beckenham, Kent, originally constructed in the 13th century. Within the timber-framed passageway of the lych gate is a revolving gate, which is an unusual feature and one of only a handful in existence in England. ‘Lych’ derives from the Anglo-Saxon or German word for corpse, and is named after the structure’s primary function of storing the coffin before burial. Lych gates also serve as a meeting point and shelter for funeral parties before they are met by the priest.The fishing industry in Newlyn on the south coast of Cornwall expanded in the 1880s, resulting in the construction of a new harbour and two piers. In the early 20th century, the south pier was extended to give better protection to the harbour and a tidal observatory was built at its north end. The observatory was one of three constructed at the request of Ordnance Survey to establish Mean Sea Level.The former lifeboat house, built in 1884, was designed by CH Cooke and represents the crucial role played by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in saving lives at sea since the 19th century. Its wide gabled structure and ornamental treatment, made up of fish-scale tiling, decorative moulded brick, and a beautifully incorporated bay window, create a finely detailed and strikingly composed building.2634 Cattle Trough and Drinking Fountain. Spaniards Road, HampsteadCattle troughs were once commonplace in Britain, with the politan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association (MDFCTA) responsible for over 1000 of them. Around 500 of these were located in London, however a large number have now been lost. The trough in Spaniards Road was believed to have been erected in 1916, making it a particularly late example of its type. Although the pump and spout mechanism are missing, the cattle trough is an important reminder that horse-drawn transport was commonplace in the early 20th century, despite the increasing use of motorised transport. In providing free drinking water for horses, charities like the MDFCTA also played an important role in raising standards in animal welfare.This early 17th century gatehouse to the former Caynton Manor is a remarkable survival, previously undiscovered. Originally a formal gateway to a wealthy country house, it has been used for agricultural purposes since the 18th century. While very little is known about the house which the gatehouse served, the quality of the gatehouse signifies a substantial building of high status. It is a well-proportioned building with a red sandstone base, a tiled roof and good quality detailing, characteristic of this building type at the time it was built, around 1635. Of particular interest is the carved detailing around the archways and the elaborate plasterwork in the principal rooms inside the gatehouse. This listing means that it can now be assessed for inclusion on Historic England’s Heritage at Risk Register, which would enable Historic England to offer specialist technical advice to help secure its future.This early 17th century gatehouse to the former Caynton Manor is a remarkable survival, previously undiscovered.

Chipping Camden, Gloucestershire The garden at Kingcombe complements Grade II listed Kingcombe House. It is an increasingly rare survival of an Arts and Crafts garden laid out in the 1930s. The pre-war garden is well-preserved and is an impressive and thoughtful design which includes Italian influences in the terraced garden including Italian steps to ide it from the more functional parts of the garden and to provide a vertical link from the top of the terraces to the meadow beyond the garden. Intact gardens dating from the 1930s are rare in England. It was designed initially by Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe and Russell Page with Sir Gordon Russell between 1927 and 1936 with later additions by Sir Gordon Russell from the 1940s through to the 1970s. During the Second World War and the austerity years that followed, few private houses were built so commissions for new gardens were few and far between.3034 Garden at Kingcombe.

Castle Place, NottinghamAcclaimed sculptor and Nottingham native, James Arthur Woodford RA OBE was commissioned to craft this imaginative group of sculptures, depicting the legendary characters of Robin Hood and his Merry Men, to commemorate the visit of their Royal Highnesses the Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh for the city’s quincentenary celebrations in 1949. Woodford conceived the group of sculptures to occupy the land in the outer ditch of Nottingham Castle, the setting of one of the most popular legendary tales of Robin Hood. 3234 Robin Hood and his Merry Men.

Cappleside Barn in Ribblesdale, North Yorkshire was built in 1714. It is a large barn with a remarkable ornamental roof structure with carefully shaped timbers that also include carved motifs such as ‘daisy-wheels’. At first, Historic England thought that these roof timbers had been reused from a high-status medieval house, but dendrochronology has shown that the timbers came from trees felled shortly before the construction of the barn.

After a punter complained the raffle had been misleading, the Advertising Standards Authority\u0026nbspruled the competition was not fair.The alternative cash prize given – roughly a 40th of the value of the castle – was not, the watchdog said, a “reasonable equivalent”.The couple who bought a 20-bed castle for the price of a London flatIt ruled: “Because neither the advertised prize nor a reasonable alternative had been awarded, we concluded that the promotion had not been administered fairly and was in breach of the code.”Ms DeVere said she will appeal the ruling.The castle, built in the 1880s, was offered as a prize after attempts to sell it had proven unsuccessful.\u0026nbspMs\u0026nbspDeVere advertised the raffle on\u0026nbspFacebook and\u0026nbspwinacastle.But she claims it was made explicit that, if not enough tickets were sold to cover her mortgage, a cash prize would be offered instead.And the author told ASA that, after the draw had taken place, the winner was offered a share of the property and a chance to run a business there had they wanted to.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000.

If the Brexit deal undermines the Good Friday accords there will be no chance of a UK-US trade agreement. I say that hopefully, that we will not have to face that reality, but I say it as a prediction.”Ms Pelosi’s words were met with applause by a packed chamber of parliamentarians, and special guests including U2 frontman Bono – who she praised at length, noting that after attending so many of his concerts, she was glad to see he was in her audience for a change.She also remarked on the legacy of John Hume and the late Martin McGuinness, and delivered a powerful tribute to the Northern Ireland peace process.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

We must not and we will not allow that progress to be undermined.”Referring to the well-known links between the US and Ireland, Ms Pelosi noted: “While I don’t have Irish grandparents, we do take pride in having Irish grandchildren.”On climate change, Ms Pelosi noted that the US had much to learn from Irish initiatives, and said: “We must do better and we must do more, together ...

I have kept my promise.Mr Imamoglu\u0026nbspnarrowly defeated the strongly favoured Mr Yildirim\u0026nbspof the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 31 March municipal elections that represented an unexpected setback for Mr Erdogan, who built his career as mayor of Istanbul 25 years ago. The city has served as the political backbone of the AKP, generating huge real estate deals that benefit the country\u0027s powerful development conglomerates and various oligarchs who support the party.“It seems that the desire for Istanbul is very big in the government, because of all the patronage, said Emre Erdogan, a political scientist at Istanbul\u0027s Bilgi University. They don’t want to transfer ownership\u0026nbspof the municipality. It means they will fight for it.Ekrem Imamoglu arrives at the Istanbul Election Board on Wednesday (EPA)The AKP\u0026nbspand its far-right ally, the National Movement Party (MHP), have\u0026nbspchallenged the elections,\u0026nbsppointing to unspecified irregularities. First\u0026nbspthey demanded\u0026nbspa recount, and now they are pushing for holding the entire Istanbul elections anew.Mr Imamoglu\u0026nbspholds\u0026nbspa 13,000-vote lead. There were few if any complaints or reports of election-day irregularities, and the AKP has yet to present any evidence to back up its claims of fraud. Mr Erdogan’s own interior minister Suleyman Soylu on Wednesday rejected the AKP’s fraud claims. “The election system in Turkey is better than anywhere else in the world,” local media quoted him as saying. “The system has no flaws. Such a discussion is baseless.Legal experts say the Supreme Election Commission – which is said to be packed with appointees by Mr​ Erdogan – could still vacate Mr Imamoglu’s mandate, and call for another election, and many analysts said they could not fathom the AKP not fighting for Istanbul until the end.It seems that the desire for Istanbul is very big in the government, because of all the patronage. They don’t want to transfer ownership of the municipality.The Supreme Election Council has already ordered a redo of the municipal contest in Honaz, a town of 30,000 that the AKP lost by a single vote.But that would carry risks for the government and the ruling party. Increasingly impatient supporters of Mr Imamoglu have been chanting in support of his mayoralty at football games, and a rerun of the election could draw even more opposition voters frustrated by a flailing economy and eroding political freedoms under the AKP.\u0026nbspStill some people can\u0027t countenance the idea of the AKP giving up on Istanbul, even if it means further undermining Turkey\u0027s fragile democratic institutions.\u0026nbspFor the AKP, the cost of losing Istanbul is greater than\u0026nbspthe image of\u0026nbspTurkey as a liberal democracy, said Mr Erdogan, the scholar.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is an emergency.In Parliament, Remainers outnumber Leavers. They need to understand the numbers that really count are the .million and the  per cent who voted Out — scope for a decent Leave party majority.Only a new pro-Brexit leader can start repairing the damage Mrs May has inflicted on ­voters’ trust and the stability of our political system. It might yet be too late.The genuine stock of sympathy and support commanded by this “bloody dficult woman” evaporated completely on March , her promised date for Brexit.All those reassuring poll leads over Labour turn out to be an illusion, bolstered by Ukip deserters who rallied to the Tories for the  ­General ­Election.They trusted Mrs May in  when she promised “Brexit means Brexit” and in  as she vowed “No Deal is better than a bad deal”. They don’t trust her any more.Both promises were flushed down the pan along with £.billion for a No Deal that never was — and the £million EU elections she insisted would never happen. Not to mention her £billion EU ransom.Staunch Conservatives are ticked off, disgusted to see Mrs May plotting with arch-enemy Corbyn to thwart Brexit, and Chancellor Phil Hammond backing a second referendum before delivering the first.Local party chiefs are on strike. Canvassers steer clear of angry voters. Donors have zipped their wallets and cash has dried up. Meanwhile, recruits flock to Nigel Farage’s new Brexit Party, boosted by the Rees-Mogg “brand” with Jacob’s ­sister, Annunziata, stepping up as a candidate. Her example will attract Tory dissidents.Even ex-party chairman Lord Tebbit admits he will find it hard to vote Torythe EU elections go ahead on May .Once gone, defectors are ­dficult to lure back. That’s why party grandees are spending Easter finding ways to ­dislodge Mrs May’s limpet grip on Number Ten.Leadership rules protect her from another challenge before October. They must be changed.The new leader must be a Brexiteer, which leaves only three viable options — former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, ex-Brexit supremo Dominic Raab and Environment Secretary Michael Gove.

Any blaze has destructive power. Yet the Notre Dame disaster leaves a greater sense of obliteration. Just look at the crowds of Parisians, many of them youngsters, who wept and clutched one another and sang mournful hymns as they watched Monday’s devastation.Their grief, and the awed horror of countless millions around the world who saw events unfold on TV, was not the normal reaction of onlookers rubber-necking at an accident. The loss of that old building left a deeper anguish. Why James Mates, reporting for ITV’s News At Ten that night, proved his value when he reached for an explanation.“Our time here is brief,” said Mates. “These structures — the greatest creations of mankind — are supposed to be permanent. Few can have imagined seeing one destroyed before our eyes.”These were good words. Notre Dame dates to the th and th centuries. To stand beside such an edice reminds us of our human smallness.The great cathedrals of Western Europe took centuries to build. Beside such projects, the longest human le feels butterfly-short. You run a hand over the old stones of a place like Notre Dame and you are struck by a sense of your own impermanence.You don’t have to be churchy to feel this way. There are other forces at work in our Notre Dame agony, emotions that a modern broadcaster might hesitate to mention. Notre Dame contained more than altars and crosses and pews.Its walls sheltered things far greater than the priceless artworks which burned. Notre Dame was a repository of the concepts of civilisation and nationhood and beauty and Christianity.It may be politically incorrect to say so but Monday’s fire, to many of us, felt like a metaphor for the recent conflagration of those precious moral concepts. French president Emmanuel Macron, who rushed to the scene, had this to say: “Notre Dame is our history, our literature, part of our psyche, the place of all our great events, our epidemics, our wars, our liberations, the epicentre of our lives.”Macron announced a national project to rebuild the cathedral because, “it is our profound destiny”. All this was noble and fair. But measure it against the record of the liberal political class he embodies. The Macrons and Merkels of this world — like the Blairs and Camerons and Cleggs and so many other equivocating cultural cowards — have long preached secularisation. They have diluted Christian values in our laws and public le.One recent Archbishop of Canterbury even told us it might be a good idea to have sharia law in Britain.These political leaders have imposed education systems that fail to teach youngsters to be proud of Western art and religion. They have scoffed at national pride and national flagsand lied to us about the federal element of the European Union.Out of sheer political dogma, post-war politicians bigged up modernist architecture, even though the public hated it. Much-loved vistas were destroyed and our capital cities’ skylines were wrecked when mayors approved show-off skyscrapers.We were told to be ashamed of past national historical triumphs such as the British Empire, which was allegedly racist and supremacist. Tradition was bad. Dferent was good. How come such leaders appreciate antiquity and the values represented by a great cathedral such as Notre Dame only when it has gone up in smoke One of the defining images of the Second World War was that photograph of St Paul’s Cathedral at the height of the Blitz, the dome standing proud amid Hitler’s bombs. The picture captured an idea of British defiance, of our country’s decency withstanding a Nazi dictator’s barbarism. It still makes one’s neck prickle with patriotism.What will we in future feel when we see that image of Notre Dame ablaze on Monday night  Might it come to represent the torching of Christendom in Europe It is said that the Paris fire brigade was slow out of the traps. Might that be a metaphor for a wider carelessness by politicians who have seen our culture in peril and failed to act It is no great secret that churches in France and other continental countries have been in a spiral of neglect for decades. A few years ago I visited a major church in Coutances, northern France, and found dead pigeons on the floor and broken panes in the windows.We have done better in Britain where, despite financial problems, our cathedrals and parish churches continue to be a great glory. The Church of England gets plenty of things wrong but it deserves credit for this.That Notre Dame and some of her treasures have been destroyed in Holy Week, as though roasted in the very fires of Hell, is a challenge to our already-dented morale. It seems cruel and may leave churchgoers agape as they try to identy the Almighty’s purpose.If God is working his purpose out, He has an odd way of going about it.But Easter is about renewal. Maybe that should be our pointer.Let this ghastly fire act as a spark to our resolve to relight a sense of pride in Europe’s Christian tradition.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has had a huge impact on my childhood and teenage years – right into adulthood.I was diagnosed with the chronic skin condition at just six years old. Flare-ups would often leave me with an angry rash and even bleeding wounds across my arms, legs, back and face. My lips would swell so much that I couldn’t speak and would beg to stay off school.Through my teenage years I hid how my skin bothered me and concentrated on things that made me happy like good friends and sports instead.However, any sudden stress surrounding exam time or a cold-snap of weather would have an impact on my skin.At the age of , I thought I’d found the answer through learning about allergens that might set it off and following a strict diet and exercise regime.I eliminated gluten, dairy, sweets, crisps and anything processed but I also found that tomatoes, oranges and lettuce were also foods I needed to avoid to prevent flare-ups.Exercising is known to help release endorphins that reduce stress, and raise energy levels throughout the day.I find that in addition to that, it makes you feel better about yourself and you sweat out any toxins.My skin felt better too. What I wasn’t aware of is that I’d swapped one problem for another.Instead of being controlled by eczema I was being controlled by my new regime, which had spiralled into an obsession. I’d rather skip a meal than eat the wrong things.Soon I was existing on only juices, convinced I was being healthy but I was running on empty body, mind and soul.Around five years ago, I had lost all hope and was hospitalised because of my eczema. One evening after a flare up, I felt a rush of heat rise up my body from my toes to my head.I looked into the mirror and saw that my face was swelling.I felt dizzy and the pressure in my head was unbearable. I grabbed my phone to call a friend and he drove me to AE.Once I was seen, it was clear that my inflammatory markers were off the charts.The doctors said that the swelling was due to my eczema and the open wounds coupled with a  per cent deficiency in zinc meant that my body’s immune system wasn’t working properly.I had lost all hope. I remember frantically Googling for eczema success stories only to find that none existed.Even the doctors told me that I would never recover or find a solution.When it comes to eczema, people often underestimate how healing really does start in your head and mastering the mind can have a signicant impact on reducing symptoms and regaining control.Working out why your skin is flaring up in the first place and addressing that as a long-term solution is vital.I started to change the way I reacted to things, understand the triggers and turn negative situations into something much more positive.Through years of trial and error I found that my triggers were food that was processed or unnatural, stress or a sudden change in environments, lack of sleep which led to exhaustion and unnatural skincare products or chemicals such as chlorine in swimming pools.From a self-care perspective I put a series of lestyle changes in place ditching alcohol, eating mainly plant-based foods, and banning technology in the evenings in favour of Epsom, Dead Sea and Himalayan salt baths before an early night.The availability of natural skincare products helped, I’m particularly fond of Love Lula.I also focused on things I was passionate about. I saved up to train as a health coach and natural chef, and the happiness showed in my skin.These changes were helping me to find my glow and so I made it my mission to help others who suffer.Documenting my experiences and painful journey has been dficult. It hurt to look at pictures of my skin at is very worst and write about it but sharing this with the world was what was going to make a dference.Over the years I’ve developed a holistic approach to eczema management and a toolkit to healing which I call my HOPE principles.To offer a guide to living le beyond eczema I have published a book and designed a journal which unlocks a workable way to heal by putting pen to paper and reflection techniques. I want people to know that there is hope.H – is for HomeFor example de-cluttering, getting enough sleep and creating a sanctuary in the home, as well as incorporating mindfulness into your routine every day to improve your mental well being.O – is for OptimismP – is for PurposeE – is for Eating Well, Exercise and EcotherapyI understand how eczema can affect all areas of people’s lives, leaving those with the condition feeling isolated and withdrawn.One of my biggest outlets to share my experiences with others has always been through my Instagram and YouTube channels. I am very proud to be part of an online movement which is giving skin conditions like eczema increased visibility, offering support to people who are yet to be graced with positivity.Anyone who follows me knows that I am always brutally honest about my journey. Even recently when I was flying high after launching my book, my eczema flared up again and has taken a number of months to show signs of improvement.I have shared this experience with my community to show people that I am human and you can never take your mental and physical health for granted.Knowing that what I have been through is helping other people and receiving messages and DMs from my growing warrior tribe is extremely moving. I always reply to people personally and do my very best to help answer their questions – I know how hard it can be to reach out and ask for help, after all, I have been there.Eczema has been part of my journey but it doesn’t define me. In fact, one of the best things I ever did was to see the beauty in it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000483622848.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"emily thornberry champagne socialist game of thrones","story":"The Shadow Foreign Secretary hit back to tell the Instagram prankster she was a vodka and oyster socialist instead after the fancy millennial dinner party.She posted a snap of the feast she had to celebrate the new series of the smash TV show.The caption said: Game of Thrones Supper: White Walker cocktails caullower weirwoods dragon eggs house of Tyrrell crisps oysters  ice with fire  fiery fish stew. #yikes #allgoingabitfar  #millenialscooking #GameofThronesShe put on her story that the cocktails were made with vodka, triple sec and chickpea juice with blue food colouring.But one user piped up to comment: Champagne socialist.And Ms Thornberry quickly snapped back: Blue vodka and oyster socialist to you mate.Another commenter added: Thats socialism for you Em.Game of Thrones ed to our screens for a final season on Monday evening.And fans definitely werent disappointed after a two year-long wait to find out what happened since the end of the last one."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000483692260.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"notre dame no insurance policy closed tourists","story":"The news of its long-term closure comes after emerged that the  year-old monument in central Paris had no insurance policy.  WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR:Bishop Patrick Chauvet acknowledged that the famed monument would close down for five to six years as he spoke with local business owners two days after a blaze torched the roof of the cathedral and brought down its ft spire.The exact cost of the mammoth restoration project is not yet known but it is expected to be several billion pounds.

You sound like someone who wants to dictate how people live their lives.He ignored this and continued to speak, as Boulton interjected with blows to his argument.Boulton told him: Youre not giving people a choice about having their lives disrupted, you are not giving people a choice about what they think because you know its right, there is absolutely no democracy in this.In a bizarre moment Boardman-Pattison appeared to become emotional, and his voice broke as he declared how much he cared for the planet.But Boulton hit back with: So half term week when Parliament isnt even here you come here and you cause disruption in Westminster, youre not even getting a message across.Youre just a load of incompetent, middle class, self-indulgent people who want to try us how to live our lives, thats what you are isnt it.This appeared to be the final straw for the young campaigner, who stood and walked off set after saying: We face another hot summer, another el Nino, we are going to see the effects right here in the UK.People are not going to be able to put food on their plates. And I wont stand for that and I wont stand for people who wont stand up for what it means to live on this planet, and I wont stand for anything .Organisers have said they expected thousands of people to participate in non-violent action which could last for weeks.On Tuesday, a pair of climate change protesters were camped out on a glass balcony above the entrance to Shells HQ in London.Campaigners glued themselves to the entrance of the Shell building, and allegedly smashed glass in a bid to force the Government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by .Eco-warriors have demanded that the Government declares a climate emergency.Campaigners said in a statement on the action today: Participants will peacefully break the law in order to stop the Tube and then will wait to be arrested.We sincerely apologise to all those who may suffer as a consequence of this disruption.

aerial images show movement at the rogue state’s main Yongbyon nuclear site which may indicate the processing of radioactive material into fuel for nukes.Any renewed development of nuclear material would signal a defiant two fingered salute by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to Donald Trump.The US President and the unhinged despot failed to reach an agreement on the denuclearisation of the crackpot country at their summit in Vietnam in February.Washington’s Centre for Strategic and International Studies said that satellite imagery of the nuclear site from April  showed five specialised rail cars near its Uranium Enrichment Facility and Radiochemistry Laboratory.It said their movement could indicate the transfer of radioactive material.“In the past, these specialised rail cars appear to have been associated with the movement of radioactive material or reprocessing campaigns,” the think tanks report said.“The current activity, along with their configurations, does not rule out their possible involvement in such activity, either before or after a reprocessing campaign.”The US State Department declined to comment on intelligence matters, but a source familiar with its assessments said that while experts thought the movements could possibly be related to reprocessing, they were doubtful it was signicant nuclear activity.Jenny Town, a North Korea expert at the Stimson Centre think tank, said thatreprocessing was taking place, it would be a signicant given US-North Korean talks in the past year.She said: “Because there wasn’t an agreement with North Korea on Yongbyon, it would be interesting timingthey were to have started something so quickly after Hanoi.”Trump has met Kim twice in the past year to try to persuade him to abandon a nuclear weapons programme that threatens the United States and its allies South Korea and Japan.But aside from Kim refraining from carrying out missile tests, progress on denuclearisation has been scant.The Hanoi talks collapsed after Trump proposed a “big deal” in which sanctions on North Korea would be ltedit handed over all its nuclear weapons and fissile material to the United States.He rejected partial denuclearisation steps offered by Kim, which included an offer to dismantle Yongbyon.Although Kim has maintained a freeze in missile and nuclear tests since , US officials say North Korea has continued to produce fissile material that can be processed for use in bombs.Last month, a senior North Korean official warned that Kim might rethink the test freeze unless Washington made concessions.Last week, Kim said the Hanoi breakdown raised the risks of reviving tensions, adding that he was only interested in meeting Trump againthe United States came with the right attitude.Kim said he would wait “till the end of this year” for the US to decide to be more flexible.A study by Stanford University’s Centre for International Security and Cooperation released ahead of the Hanoi summit said North Korea had continued to produce bomb fuel in .They also said Kim’s regime may have produced enough rocket fuel in the past year to add as many as seven nuclear weapons to its arsenal.Experts have estimated the size of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal at anywhere between  and  warheads."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000483692499.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"time 100 most influential list brett kavanaugh christine blasey

He was expelled when Corbyn was leader for rather delightfully tweeting: “Dan Jarvis can lick my f***ing ar*e too. Posing c***.”A shame no one was on top of that detail, as I thought it would’ve added to the debate they were having about “male aggression” ruining politics.No matter, because this week we had a discussion on feminism and the open goal of Frankie Boyle asking“the biggest problem for women is the determination of some men to be objectionable”.It is, Frankie. It is.As he well knew, though, there was fat chance of any of his guests being brave or bright enough to point out there was a big problem sat right in front of them.They all live in a wilfully blind, hypocritical political universe and will ignore any personal and professional failings, no matter how obvious and odious, just so long as the person shares the same common enemy and goals as the rest of this toxic, left-wing BBC bubble.Althoughcolumnist and environmentalist George Monbiot did rather let the cat out of the bag with that end- of-show rant.“We’ve got to go straight to the heart of capitalism and overthrow it. But you said this was going to be a comedy programme, Frankie.”Oh George, how stupid and naive can you really be QVC, Katy Pullinger to Michelle Mone: “I can’t wait to see your wedding photos.” Britain’s Got Talent, David Walliams: “Sheila Simmonds, you are a very funny lady.” And Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, Jeff Brazier: “I think I might surprise a few people with who I really am.”Not unless you’re really Kirk Douglas you won’t.CHANNEL ’s three-part series Let’s Talk About Sex is a perfect example of a good idea gone bad.For it’s one thing holding up old sex education films for well-deserved ridicule. It’s quite another when you get some of the biggest C-list ar*eaches in Britain to do the ridiculing.Namely, Ulrika Jonsson, Miriam Margolyes, Danny Dyer, Jeff Brazier, Stephen Mangan, plus Alastair Campbell and his daughter Grace, who’s every bit as likeable as her old man.

But you did it for your grandchildren, to make things better.”  Ada, who lives in a neat terrace in small town near Rochdale, at the foot of the Pennines, says she has enjoyed spending time with Jon. “It’s nice to meet a young person willing to listen to some old lady talking,” she says. “I don’t say he’s changed me. But it’s been nice to disagree without arguing. It’s hard to have a sensible conversation since the vote.” Born in Dundee, before moving to Littleborough as a young woman to find work, Ada voted for Brexit because believes it is best for the NHS, where she worked as a nursing sister for  years. She also worries about the EU’s lack of accountability, the power of the European Courts and a loss of sovereignty. And she feels services in her town are being stretched by immigration, but patronised by anyone who writes Brexiteers off as ill-informed or racist.Originally from Newton Heath, north Manchester, Jon is the son of a delivery driver and a bakery assistant. He discovered politics after being inspired by his history teacher at the local comprehensive – and is now Manchester’s youngest Labour councillor, and a student union officer.Jon sees the positive effect EU membership has had on Manchester every day in the redevelopment and investment that surrounds his rented city centre flat. And he worries le will get even harder for his community and generation after Brexit. During the referendum campaign he was shocked at the ision, even watching rival campaigners brawl in the street.  He says he was frequently told he was too young to know what he was voting for, and joined Britain Talks in the hope of having more productive conversations about Brexit – and understanding why people voted the way they did. “I was nervous,” he admits. “I didn’t want to be part of a slanging match, but talking over a brew or having a meal has made it about getting to know each other first.” The things Jon and Ada have in common were obvious from the first time they met. Ada was wearing a bee-themed scarf to commemorate the Manchester arena attack, while Jon has a bee tattoo on his wrist in solidarity with the families.Both describe themselves as “ordinary, working class people” trying to make sense of an extraordinary situation. During their meetings, they also discovered they shared a love of Netflix crime dramas, takeaways, pride in the NHS and in their families. Both are prudent and house proud with busy, sociable lives – days and nights spent helping others. Ada volunteers with homeless people and Jon works hard as a councillor to support local people. “We have quite a lot in common, more than you’d think,” Jon says. “We both care about where we live and want the best for our city and country - we just have dferent ideas about what happens next. I share some of the pride Ada has about where she’s from. It’s just that for me, it’s about being a Mancunian, then British, then European.” Whether it was a first, slightly nervous meeting over cheese and pickle sandwiches served on china plates in Ada’s immaculate terraced home, or a talking over endless hot tea in Jon’s new build city centre flat – it was clear they both love to talk. They will never agree on whether or not we should leave the EU, but they leave with a deeper understanding of each other’s points of view and a mutual respect.  “I know why you voted how you did, I know where your ideas were coming from,” Ada tells Jon. “I’ve learnt more about where EU money goes, what it does in the city, no-one ever really said that before. I’m shocked at how expensive it is to live in Manchester and how mature Jon is. Young people don’t always have it easy, I can see that. Jon is a lovely person, but I don’t think I’d want to be young now. “He has voted based on what he believes in, he’s done the research, he really has. But I don’t think that much will change when we’re out, we will adapt, we’ll find ways to do things like we did before we joined. I remember that. Jon doesn’t. I hope I’ve reassured him it will be okay.” Both say stepping out of their comfort zone, where most of those they know share their views, has been important – and hard to achieve without a project like Britain Talks.  “Spending time with Ada has given me insights I didn’t have before,” Jon says. “Being able to talk without all the shouting, with respect, means we’ve actually shared our opinions and where those opinions come from - what we’ve based them on - and that feels really important.” * Will you join Britain Talks  Start your journey by answering the question below...

Dr Alan Jamieson, , plunged ,ft to the deepest point of the Indian Ocean’s Java Trench, taking two and a half hours to get there. During an eight-hour mission, they captured remarkable footage of what are believed to be entirely new species, as yet unseen by humans. The footage includes the jelly-like stalked ascidean, or sea squirt, which lives attached to the seabed. Other previously unseen species imaged included hadal snailfish.    As Chief Scientist on the Five Deeps Expedition, he reached one of the most isolated points on the planet - the deepest point of the Java Trench in the Indian Ocean, around  nautical miles south of the island of Bali. Led by US deep sea pioneer Victor Vescovo, the expedition travelled more than ,m - almost five miles - to the ocean floor in a two-man submarine. Dr Jamieson, a senior lecturer in marine ecology at Newcastle University, said: “It is not often we see something so extraordinary it leaves us speechless. Amongst many other rare and unique observations, the stalked Ascidean was a really signicant moment. We are not entirely sure what species it was, we will find out in due course.

This was the first time hadal snailfish had been seen, with my own eyes.    This particular family of fish are only found in this trench and I knewwe saw any fish down here, we would be the first to have seen them. Sure enough, after  minutes at the bottom, there they were. Sadly, on a previous trip, the team also uncovered the first evidence of man-made fibres and plastic in the guts of crustaceans, some of the deepest living organisms on Earth, showing man-made pollution has now reached the outer limits of our planet.

Julie Rose has been forced to prove the legitimacy of her marriage to her Canadian husband and partner of more than a decade, Jeff. The couple met in Canada with Jeff entering the UK on an ancestry visa in , reports the Manchester Evening News. They tied the knot in , choosing to settle in Milnrow, Rochdale, to enable Julie to take care of her mother. When Jeff, , tried to renew his visa in July  his application was rejected on grounds his relationship with Julie was not genuine. The couple became locked in a battle with the Home Office, with Jeff placed on immigration bail and threatened with deportation.    Jeff and Julie have finally won their case after a judge ruled in their favour at an immigration tribunal last month. Julie describes their ordeal with the Home Office as aposa nightmareapos. Youaposre put in a situation where a complete stranger is making a decision thataposs going to affect the rest of your le, says Julie. Itaposs hard to describe the stress it has caused myself and Jeff. There is no accountability or humanity in this process. When Jeff attempted to renew his visa, he was given incorrect advice from a Home Office helpline, resulting in him being threatened with forcible removal from the UK. Jeff has UK ancestors [his paternal grandfather was born in Derbyshire], enabling him to enter the country on an ancestry visa. The couple were given conflicting advice from the Home Office about what to do, and were told to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain under the ‘Spousal Routeapos once the ancestry visa had expired a year later. The Home Office took  months to reject the application –  months longer than its target. Julie says they have lost around £, in legal fees and visa applications as well as more than a year of Jeff’s salary. Once placed on immigration bail, Jeff was unable to work and ultimately lost his job as a key worker for vulnerable young adults.    The coupleaposs MP, Tony Lloyd, backed their case, slamming the way they had been treated in a letter to Home Office minister Caroline Nokes. The result of this has been utterly devastating for Mr. Rose and his family, Mr Lloyd wrote in the letter. After  and a half years’ dedicated service as a Support Worker, Mr. Rose’s employer was forced to terminate his employment out of fear of receiving heavy penalties from the Home Office. Mr. Rose has always worked, paid taxes, owns his own home and has always been proud of his British heritage, choosing to describe himself as English Canadian. In response, Ms Nokes apologised to the couple in a reply to Mr Lloyd. Referring to a bail notice wrongly issued to Mr Rose, Ms Nokes said: “It was not the Home Office’s intention to cause any distress in this regard and an apology was offered.” She also apologised for the delay in processing the application. Judge Andrew Davies described the advice given to Jeff on the Home Officeaposs helpline as aposdubiousapos in his final judgement. He wrote: In my judgement, it is not reasonable. It is entirely unreasonable. The Appellant has attempted to remain within the Immigration Rules. He was given dubious advice. There has been unacceptable delay in dealing with the matter. Jeff spoke of his relief now he has been granted leave to remain. Itaposs a bizarre feeling when youaposve been through something like that, he said. We hope to get things sorted out and piece together our lives again. My first priority will be to find another job because I lost my other one. To be honest, Iaposm just relieved itaposs over. A Home Office spokesperson said: “All immigration applications are considered on their inidual merits and on the basis of the evidence available, in line with the immigration rules.” "},{"url":null,"title":"eerie new photos reveal untouched","story":"NewsEerie new photos reveal untouched car graveyard beneath Welsh mountainGareth Owen made the journey through darkness ft beneath Ceredigion, Wales, into the disused mine where he captured snaps of the bittersweet sightShareCommentsByJessica CrippsAmber Hicks:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video eerie-video-reveals-abandoned-car-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEerie new photos from inside the aposCavern of Lost Soulsapos reveal the mountain of abandoned cars still untouched years after they were first uncovered. Electrician and photographer Gareth Owen made the journey earlier this month through darkness inside the disused mine, which closed in the s and is around ft beneath Ceredigion, Wales. He was stunned at the sight of the pile of vehicles stacked upon each other above the still blue water with a Ford Cortina balanced on the top. The waterfall-like formation can be seen lit up by a beam of light. Despite the surprising beauty of the images, Gareth, , was also shocked by the stash in the aposunrecognisable rubbish tipapos.  He claimed it was a bittersweet sight that reminded him of the impact rubbish had on the natural environment. Gareth, who is from Llanberis in North Wales, said: Once your eyes adjust to the sudden beam of light you realise the sheer scale of the place. There are hundreds of cars on top of each other. They are mostly unrecognisable by now but then front and center of the pile is a Ford Cortina - it was the only real colour on the pile. I guess being so used to photographing the natural landscapes and their beauty, photographing this spot was bittersweet for me. As eye-catching as it is, at the end of the day it is a rubbish tip from a time when the environment was not in the forefront of our minds.  But it is also a great reminder of how far we have come as a country to doing what we can to protect nature from now into the future.He added: The reaction to the photo itself has been immensely positive. But the subject matter has had a mixed response with some people not quite happy about the fact these cars were dumped underground and others seeing beauty in the carnage. I have done a number of underground explorations including natural caverns to old mines.  I really enjoy exploring the unknown beneath our feet, so having seen an image online I went on a hunt for the aposCavern of the Lost Soulsapos, as it is known. The pleasures I get from exploring underground are amazing and itaposs amazing to think what is right under our feet.

John Murray has launched a civil claim for damages against an ex-aide to Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi to try and force him to appear in court. Retired Mr Murray, , hopes Saleh Ibrahim Mabrouk will reveal who shot PC Fletcher. He said: “I have been doing this for  years and it means everything to me to get him in court as I see that as my job to do that, so that there is justice for Yvonne.    Mr Murray’s lawyers also hope to get key material that was previously kept secret for national security reasons presented in court for the first time. He said: “The main thing is to make that evidence public and make people realise what that evidence contains. I think once that evidence is made public people will be shocked. Proceedings were served on Mabrouk, who denies wrongdoing, this week. He was arrested on suspicion of murder in  but in  the politan Police said that while they knew who was responsible, charges could not be brought.    His son, Osama Saleh Ibrahim, said at the time his father “didn’t do anything”.

PC Fletcher was fatally shot and Mr Murray promised her as she lay dying that he would find her killers. Mr Murray, who has been diagnosed with PTSD, said: “Those words were the last she heard and that stays with you for ever. I see it as my duty to get that person in court.” His lawyer, Matthew Jury, from McCue  Partners, said: “On behalf of all those who loved and knew Yvonne, John wants to fulfil the promise he gave to her before she died - to bring the suspects to justice. These proceedings may be the last chance.”    On Wednesday, politan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick laid a wreath at the memorial to PC Fletcher,  years since she was killed. The Scotland Yard chief said: “I was a young officer in the Met  years ago when Yvonne was shot. In  I worked from West End Central - just half a mile from St James’ Square. “That terrible event shook all of us who were in the Met at that time. All these years later there may be fewer people who directly experienced the impact of those events still in the Met, but as a police family we still collectively feel her loss.    “Today we mark her death and remember the contribution she made as a valued colleague and as a police woman, dedicated to the public, and we think of her family.” The force said the investigation in to her death remains open and it is “absolutely committed to bringing justice to her and her family”.

Bradley Aspin was left with the severe injury after arguing with stranger Jermaine Allen, who then attacked him at House of Smith, in Collingwood Street, Newcastle. The then -year-old was thrown down a flight of stairs. Now Allen, , of Brindleclose, Bradford, has been jailed for four years and six months for the attack, which happened in September . After police revealed how they had to trawl city hotels to find their suspect, Bradley has spoken of his ordeal.  The -year-old said: I donapost know what happened exactly. I canapost remember any of it as I was knocked unconscious but I have seen the CCTV. It left me with two broken bones in my back and I was in a back brace for five months, I couldnapost walk without it, and had to take medication and undergo physio. It happened two-and-a-half years ago now but when it first happened it really badly affected me. I wasnapost able to work and I couldnapost socialise. I did feel depressed as I couldnapost do any of my day-to-day activities. Even now I still need to do muscle strengthening, I canapost go to the gym and I canapost play football which is something that I always loved to do. Bradley, who is from Stockton, was enjoying a night out in Newcastle when he crossed paths with Allen, who had travelled to the city from Bradford CCTV footage played in court showed them arguing at the top of a flight of stairs before Allen attacked Bradley and threw him down the steps.  Allen then went back into the bar while his teenage victim was taken to hospital, where it was discovered his back was broken in two places. When officers from Northumbria Police arrived at the bar and attempted to detain Allen he became aggressive and was able to flee on foot after a group of his pals intervened in his arrest. An investigation was launched to identy him, but police did not know his name and the only information they had was that he was believed to live in Bradford. Officers spoke to dozens of witnesses, trawled through CCTV and carried out enquiries at hotels across the city before eventually tracking Allen down. He was arrested in January last year. Allen claimed he was acting in self-defence but was charged with grievous bodily harm with intent and was convicted by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court. Bradley however, is still living with the consequences of the attack. He added: It has massively, massively changed my le because now I have to be careful what I’m doing. I am always looking over my shoulder and I donapost go out drinking as much as I did because I donapost want that to happen again. It took the police six or seven months to find him so I am really happy that he has been caught and convicted at court. It is a bit of closure for me.  He put me through a traumatic experience and I feel like justice has been done and I am grateful to the police and my barrister for proving what he did to me and getting him convicted. Sgt Andy Percival, of the Newcastle City Centre Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: This was a very serious assault that has left a young man with le-changing injuries and I welcome the sentence handed down by the judge. On the night of the assault all parties had been drinking and clearly there was a heated argument but nothing can justy the actions of Jermaine Allen. You can clearly see on the CCTV that Allen struck his victim multiple times before forcing him down the stairs and he knew that his actions would cause serious injury. He has then refused to give himself up and lashed out at officers in a bid to avoid arrest instead of taking responsibility for putting a young man in hospital. It was down to the patience and hard work of the investigating officers that we were able to track him down and bring him to justice for this assault.

This time last year, Danielle King, from Edinburgh, was at her lowest weight and lowest point of her le.She developed a phobia of food and calories and saw them as the enemy, reports the Daily Record.The -year-old was seeing a therapist weekly and was an out-patient at a specialist facility but despite the help, anorexia dominated her le and she almost felt like giving up.I was basically just eating to stay alive but even then it was barely anything, Danielle bravely admitted in a Facebook post.I started to not see the point in living as I basically wasn’t anyway.    It stopped me going on holiday with my best friends, stopped me going out for meals and socialising, stopped me going to college, it got in the way of work and everything , it was ruining my le. I hated myself. I was giving up on le. Living just became a day to day chore for me. However one year on, Danielle has started to piece her le back together and admits sheaposs so bloody proud of herself. She has shared two photos of herself showing her incredible journey to recovery and spoken of how she has begun to enjoy food and eats regular healthy balanced meals. The post has prompted praise from hundreds who have described Danielle as an inspiration.  Danielle said: I’m starting to live my le the way it should be lived, I’m starting to enjoy food but don’t get me wrong I’m not completely there yet but I’m progressing in ways I never thought I would. I’m finally becoming happy again, I’m starting to become my old bubbly self and not just putting on an act and god I’ve missed the old me so much. It’s been a hell of a journey so I’m not giving up without a fight ! I’ve still got a long way to go both mentally and physically but I think it’s fair to say I’m currently kicking ass. She continued: I still find food frightening and I still have a lot of bad days but I’m now willing to take on a challenge, I mean I’ve had foods I thought I’d never see myself having ever again.  year down the line and I can finally say I’m starting to recover from anorexia! Danielle hopes that by sharing her story she can help other sufferers and show that she is proof it can get better.    She says that although it may seem like a losing battle it does get easier. She added: I never thought I’d be saying this but recovery is well and truly possible and I’m the evidence to prove that as are many other people. We should all enjoy food as it keeps us alive and fuels our bodies and also because it tastes hella good. We shouldn’t beat ourselves upwe are a few calories over our intake like how I used to. Now I don’t even have an intake, or count my calories. I live my le the way I want to and not how my anorexic self wants it. Keep fighting your demons like I am mine. We’re all in this together.

But according to a top Italian pasta maker there are a few big mistakes lots of us when we make the carby delight. Giovanni Rana has been cooking pasta since the s, and has teamed up with his daughter-in-law Antonella Rana to share their secrets. The first is about how much sauce you add to the pasta.    While most of us will add a whole jar of sauce or make a big portion of it, apparently we should be using much less. Antonella says this can be a big giveaway when it comes to spotting an inexperienced chef.She told the Mail Online : When you have great fresh filled pasta, the flavour is inside. You just need to add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of Parmigiana Reggiano. If you want to enhance the flavour more then use the sauce, but only in a small spoon.When youaposre speaking about fresh pasta tortellini, the filling has its own taste and power, as Italians we try not to cover it too much with the sauce.    In general, the most traditional way to eat fresh filled pasta is to be very respectful of the proportions. The queen is the pasta and the sauce is the tool. Antonella also says that there is a common misconception about al dente pasta. While most believe itaposs the apostraditionalapos way to eat it, thataposs not actually the case. She claims that while people in the south like pasta almost raw, those in the north prefer it much softer. They say the best way to get it right is simply to follow the advice on the packet - easy!

The carrier, which is saddled with roughly £m [. billion] of bank debt, has been on the edge of collapse for weeks after failing to receive a loan of around £m [m] from its lenders. This money was agreed in late March as part of a rescue deal. The company said in a statement: It is with deep sadness and with a heavy heart that we would like to share with you that, effective immediately, Jet Airways will be suspending all its domestic and international operations. At its peak, Jet operated over  planes and well over  daily flights. The airline, which has roughly , employees, has in recent weeks been forced to cancel hundreds of flights and to halt all flights to overseas destinations, as funds have dried up.  Intense competition from low-cost carriers, like Interglobe-owned IndiGo and SpiceJet Ltd, together with higher oil prices, hefty fuel taxes and a weak rupee have piled pressure on the airline in recent months. In its statement, the airline thanked its loyal customers for their patronage and support over  years and said it sincerely and profusely apologises for the disruption to the travel plans of all its guests. The airline said it would continue to work with its lenders, who are trying to identy an investor willing to buy a majority stake in the airline and attempt to turn it around. Jet Airways said it would continue to support the bid process initiated by the banks and that it hopes to resume flying soon. Its lenders, led by State Bank of India , have been seeking expressions of interest for an up to  percent stake in the airline. Initial expressions bids were submitted last week. Jet Airways, in its statement, said it had been informed late on Tuesday night by its lenders that they were unable to consider its request for critical interim funding. Since no emergency funding from the lenders or any other source is forthcoming, the airline will not be able to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations going, the airline said. Two sources at state-run banks told Reuters that the bankshad rejected a request for  billion rupeesfrom Jet to keep itself temporarily afloat.  Bankers did not want to go for a piecemeal approach which would keep the carrier flying for a few days and then again risk having Jet come back for more interim funding, said one of the bank sources directly involved in Jetaposs debt resolution process. The sources declined to be named as they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media. SBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The crisis at Jet, which owes vast sums to suppliers, pilots lessors and oil companies, has deepened in recent weeks as its lessors have scrambled to de-register and take back planes, in a sign the bank rescue plan had failed to assuage their concerns. Indiaaposs aviation regulator said on its website on Wednesday that lessors had applied to de-register another four Boeing Co  planes. An analysis of the latest data disclosed by Indiaaposs Directorate General of Civil Aviation shows that Jetaposs lessors have, so far, sought to deregister and repossess at least  planes operated by Jet. Once deregistered, lessors are free to reclaim a plane and lease it to another airline. The rapid exodus of planes risks further eroding value from the carrier, even as lenders scurry to find an investor willing to buy a majority stake in the airline.

Derek McInnes has urged those players set to exit Pittodrie in the summer to leave their team-mates with European football next season.The fight for a sixth successive European qualication is all that is left from a campaign that at times had promised so much but will yet again deliver no silverware.The Scottish Cup bid crashed at Hampden in a - defeat to holders Celtic where four Dons, including McInnes and assistant manager Tony Docherty, were sent off.Retaining the league runners-up spot is effectively beyond the Reds with Rangers holding a commanding eight-point lead and superior goal dference with five games left.When the season finishes, McInnes faces a summer of rebuilding with a number of first-team players set to exit the club.As many as  players could call time on their Pittodrie careers following the final match of the campaign at Hibs on Sunday May .Although they will not be at the club to experience the benefits of Continental action, McInnes has challenged those set to leave to deliver one final push for Europe.He said: “There will be a lot of players leaving at the end of the season.“There might be some wanting to leave and there might be some players going back to their parent clubs.“But it is important that all at the club, especially the players, myself and the staff, show that enthusiasm after that disappointment .“I have reminded all the players that we have five games left and it is important that we have a full responsibility now of achieving our goal of getting that European football and getting that third spot.“We have work to do.”Six players have contracts set to expire at the end of the season with a further five on loan set toto their parent clubs.The Pittodrie contracts for Scotland internationals Graeme Shinnie and Gary Mackay-Steven are both set to end. McInnes wants to retain both and captain Shinnie has been offered an attractive long-term deal.However, both are coveted by other teams. Shinnie travelled to Derby County last week for talks with manager Frank Lampard and to be shown around Pride Park.League One leaders Luton Town as well as second tier English sides Wigan Athletic and Bristol City are interested in Shinnie.Rangers were reportedly interested, but If the Dons skipper, as appears likely, is to leave it will be for a move down to England.Winger Mackay-Steven is also a target for MLS side New York City, who made an official approach to the Dons in January for permission to speak to the -year-old.Long-serving defender Andy Considine is also out of contract this summer but has triggered a clause for a one-year extension due to the amount of games played. A new deal, however, has yet to be announced.Keeper Tomas Cerny is also out of contract as is defender Mark Reynolds, who has already signed a pre-contract with Dundee United – the club he is on loan at.Greg Halford, an emergency short-term signing due to a defensive crisis in February and yet to play, will also be out of contract.Five loanees are set to leave – Greg Stewart , James Wilson , Dom Ball , Max Loweand Tommie Hoban . The deals for Stewart, Wilson, Ball and Hoban at their parent clubs all expire at the end of the season.McInnes has entered talks with Ball regarding a permanent move and is also keen on securing the long-term future of Stewart. However, Rangers look set to land the attacker for next season.Defender Hoban is currently out injured for the next six months having undergone surgery on cruciate ligament damage sustained playing for the Dons in late February.Hoban ed to his parent club and, although his contract will run out, the Premier League club will oversee his rehabilitation.McInnes has previously stated he would be open to the possibility of securing Hoban on a permanent dealthat option opens up when he s to fitness,Hoban travelled up to Glasgow for the Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Celtic and sat alongside the injured Dons players just behind the dugout at Hampden.That defeat underlined the importance of captain Shinnie, who was suspended for the semi-final.McInnnes will not give up hope of Shinnie committing his future to the Dons, but admits they are “up against it”.He said: “I suppose there is a chance, but we are up against it with that one I think.”Derby County boss Frank Lampard wants to bring Shinnie to Pride Park, but admitted a deal has not been agreed yet.Shinnie held talks with the Rams’ boss last week before ing to the Dons camp for the Scottish Cup build-up.McInnes will hold further talks with Shinnie in the bid to convince him to stay – or gain clarication on his future.The Dons boss said: “There is nothing new on it .“Shinnie was at the game, he was at the hotel with the team, but we haven’t actually spoke to him about his own situation.“We plan to do so.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/SNS-18919054-Celtic-v-Aberdeen.jpg ","title":"mcinnes wants more bravery on the ball from his dons team","story":"Manager Derek McInnes admits Aberdeen were too tame in the Scottish Cup semi-final and lacking in bravery on the ball.The Dons crashed - to defending champions Celtic at Hampden.McInnes was one of four Dons sent off in the semi with No. Tony Docherty, Dom Ball and Lewis Ferguson also dismissed.The build up was disrupted by a season ending ankle ligament injury to winger Niall McGinn sustained in training on the day before the semi-final.McGinn’s absence added to an injury list including Shaleum Logan , Gary Mackay-Stevenand Tommie Hoban .Captain Graeme Shinnie was also suspended for the semi having exceeded the points threshold for bookings.McInnes was also frustrated at the dismissal of on-loan Rotherham defender Ball for a second yellow card when the game was -.Despite all the set-backs, however, he reckons the Dons were ultimately culpable for their own downfall at Hamdpen.He said: “While we were dealt a lot of blows in the build-up, in terms of injuries, but still felt we could go to Hampden and get the result we were after.“We had a lot of expectations on ourselves.“We knew we were playing the best team in the country and it was the biggest step we were asking the players to make to get to the final.“And it is a huge disappointment for us that we weren’t able to do that.“On the game itself we were tame and a bit safe with everything that we were trying to do.“For  minutes that’s maybe understandable given we had so many younger ones in the team.“But I was looking for more bravery on the ball and more bravery and responsibility against the ball.“I actually thought we’d weathered the early storm for ten minutes prior to Dom Ball’s sending off.”Teenage midfielder Ferguson will miss Saturday’s trip to Kilmarnock as he serves out an immediate one-game suspension for violent conduct.He will also miss the first Scottish Cup tie of next season following the straight red for a reckless two-footed lunge on Celtic’s Tom Rogic.Ball will be available to face Kilmarnock but will be banned for the first Scottish Cup tie of next season. His loan deal at Pittodrie expires at the end of the campaign, but McInnes has opened talks about securing the defender-midfielder on a permanent deal.McInnes insists Ball’s dismissal – for an aerial collision which left Celtic’s Ryan Christie needing facial surgery – was harsh and a turning point at Hampden.He said: “We had worked our way into the game and were doing away okay.“But the sending off then changed the game.“The first booking was for stopping a promising attack, butI’m right Jonny Hayes kicked the ball out the park.“There’s no doubting it was a foul, but I didn’t think it was a yellow card. In the second incident I didn’t see Dom leading with his arm or elbow.“We feel frustration in that the two incidents — an accidental collision and Dom’s first tackle on Jonny — has allowed Dom to be sent off in such a high-profile game.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/5cb074a2914bc2.84707839.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet pepper monkey and shadow are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This timid girl takes time to get to know and trust new people.But Pepper loves treats and this will help a new owner bring her out her shell and build up some trust as she has a sweet nature just waiting to get out.She will need a quiet home with an owner who has the time and patience to help her find her confidence.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields south ayrshrie council","story":"NewsBob Shields: South Ayrshrie Council need new plan to build hundreds of homesRiiverside flats face being pulled downShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’ve dominated Ayr’s skyline for exactly half a century. They’re aesthetically unappealing, architecturally worthless and my three year old grandson could probably knock up an exact replica in Lego while his left hand was peeling the foil off his Easter egg. Carbuncles, eyesores, blots on the landscape - you can call them what you like. But for a couple of hundred people at least . . . it’s the place that they call ‘home’. Last week, South Ayrshire Council started the first phase of what could end in the demolition of Ayr’s trident of riverside flats. Officials began door knocking at Riverside Place as part of the promised consultation with the remaining residents to help decide whether the flats should be renovated . . . or simply razed to the ground. By all accounts – including my dear old  year old dad – the housing staff were considerate and sympathetic while listening to everyone’s point of view. And while the many senior citizens at Riverside didn’t exactly link their arms defiantly and chant “We shall not be moved” – they left the consultants with a similar but equally strong message - “We don’t want to be moved . . .” This leaves South Ayrshire Council between three, fourteen storey blocks – and a hard place. The flats all need “core” work to their internal cladding which has reached “the end of its design le”. To simply ignore the advice of the independent structural engineers isn’t an option. In this post-Grenfell era, the words “cladding” and “tower block” make even the pencils on a health and safety officer’s desk stand to attention. But with an estimated price tag of £ million for the renovations, South Ayrshire Council must balance whether saving Riverside Place is best value compared to simply knocking them down and starting a new-build site. They next conundrum for SAC is then the poser – is best value always best practice  Re-housing – and I mean satisfactorily re-housing – what is likely to be at least  people is a decant operation of Normandy proportions. Personally, I don’t think old Bob Snr is physically or mentally equipped to be transferred anywhere. And there must be dozens - or even scores - just like him at Riverside Place. A good place for SAC to start would be to put hundreds of minds at rest and pledge ‘no compulsory transfers’ out of Riverside Place. And after that . . . work out how the heck they can achieve it! Getting the number of tenants down to  – enough to fill two blocks – would be my starting point. Decanting from one block to a similar flat in another is the least intrusive option. I don’t like the phrase ‘natural wastage’ – but it can’t be ignored. Like anywhere  in the world, Riverside Place will have its share of residents who pass on to a much higher level than fourteen floors. I’ve also spoken to several residents who would seriously consider a temporary move to other parts of Ayr – in exchange for a ‘rent free’ package. Yep – it’s called bribery . . . but it could work. And it would mean work do be done to one block at a time – with residents moving between the two that are habitable. However,the final decision is to demolish Riverside Place, it’s a whole new ball game. Butthis really is the ‘pivotal point for Ayr town centre’ that everyone is talking about – it’s the ideal time for SAC to come up with a new local authority housing plan to build hundreds of new homes over the next few years. And finally, let’s not forget the third option. Empty the flats . . . surround them in scaffolding . . . cover them in white plastic . . . and forget about them!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"council waste cash lease after","story":"NewsCouncil waste cash on lease after closing libraryResidents protested against closure of libraryShareBySarah Hilley:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsBook fury - the campaigners outside the library \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses shut a library to save cash but then wasted thousands of pounds in rent after failing to cancel the building lease.   Coylton Library closed its doors despite widespread protest from residents as part of South Ayrshire Council cuts.   The council rented the building in the village from the Masonic Lodge but never bothered to end the lease after the closure it has emerged.   It blew a year’s worth of unnecessary rent at a cost of £, public cash paying for an unused room.   It is understood the landlord repeatedly informed the council about the need to terminate the rental agreement. But no action was taken due to a blunder.   The council admitted the mistake after the Ayrshire Local Democracy Service learned of the incident.   Laura McEwan who campaigned to keep the library open said the councilaposs paperwork error was of great disappointment to residents.   She said: Once again South Ayrshire Council make disastrous financial errors which come at great cost to our local community. After much campaigning, Coylton like so many other villages lost its library services and the building stood empty for many months.   She said the £, rent could have went to other vital community services and blasted council cuts at the Coylton Gala.   The mother-of two added: How can they justy raising the council rates while this continuous waste of money is allowed to proceed unchecked    A council spokesman said: “The council’s lease at  Main Street Coylton was terminated in August , annual payments of £, were made up to this point in line with the lease agreement. The lease was not terminated earlier due to an administrative error.”   The council shut the Coylton hub  in Spring  along with two other libraries in Dailly and Dundonald to save a projected £, that year.   Coylton villagers waved placards as workers turned up to strip the shelves of books during a tense protest soon.  At the time council head of leisure Jill Cronin said the closure of the Coylton hub was “necessary” to “help the council balance its budget.” She added: We know local people are disappointed about the decision to close the library and we do sympathise.”  The Local Democracy Reporting Service was unable to reach the owner of the library building for comment.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14385183.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_asr_ayp_150419blaze2.jpg","title":"how helicopters used tons loch","story":"NewsHow helicopters used tons of loch water to battle Ayrshire wildfireThe terrying blaze engulfed large swathes of moor on Saturday night.ShareByStephen Houston:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.dailyrecord video video-helicopters-fight-fire-loch-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo helicopters hauling tons of loch water stopped a devastating wildfire from being catastrophic. People in isolated properties were on standby to run for their lives as the fierce blaze engulfed hillsides. Residents and anglers had packed up valuables and were prepared to evacuate at a moment’s notice overnight on Saturday. A major power line was also in danger of being engulfed before the helicopters doused the surrounding grass. The scale and speed of the fire - swept on by mph winds and tinderbox grass and heather - shocked rescuers. People as far away as Maybole had to close their windows as the smoke blew in. One resident said: “It was really, really scary. I have never experienced anything like it. The fire was everywhere and we were ready to leave.” And forest steward Archie McNeillie revealed: “If we did not have the helicopters I hate to think what have happened.” Ten square miles of moor, from the head of Loch Doon to the upper banks of Ayrshire’s water supply Loch Bradan, was destroyed.    Fortunately the nest site of the Loch Doon ospreys was nowhere near the flames. The main forest drive between Loch Doon and the Falls of Stinchar is credited with halting the fire’s spread south. At the one point it jumped the drive but the flames were beaten by the Carrick Lane river. Dead grass and several weeks of dry weather gave vast amounts of fuel to the fire. There is no grazing or controlled burning, which would have prevented spread, in the area. Flames came within yards of destroying the play park which overlooks Loch Riecawr. They wiped out a lecking spot for black grouse and could have claimed the lives of young birds, rabbits and deer. Fortunately only a small percentage of the valuable timber crop was damaged. Several fishing lodges were at risk of being in the path of the flames.  Forestrymen directed aircraft to dump the water, lted from Loch Skelloch, to protect these and other rural buildings. Archie McNeillie, area warden for Forestry and Land Scotland, was among nine staff called out to help at first light on Sunday. A staffer from Dalmellington was first to get called out to investigate with fire and police on Saturday night. But he said: “It was clear from the start this was bigger than anything we could handle. “The wind was so strong and we could not control it manually. That’s when we got the copters in. “The area is huge,  square kilometres.”  Archie, who starred in the BBC series The Forest with his sidekick John ‘Cool’ Coughtrie, said  per cent of the damage was open moorland. He said: “There are some trees damaged by the fire. “The fire was funnelling up the river from Loch Doon to Ballochbeaties and came into a pinch-point. We just couldn’t stop it. “The two choppers came up in the nick of time to stall it. Had they not it would have gone into the Tairlaw Plantation.” Earlier overground and underground power lines at the Loch Finlas side were under threat and the helicopters had to contain that first. As late as lunchtime on Monday there were still wisps of smoke rising but there was no fuel to make it spread. An incident command centre was switched from Dalmellington on Saturday to the foot of the road to Loch Bradan treatment works on Sunday. Wild campers near a car park at the top of Loch Doon are being hunted. Police will only officially say they are investigating but the blame is being pinned on three young men seen with a car next to a well-known trouble spot. A police spokesman said: “We are working with Scottish Fire and Rescue to establish the cause of the fire.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"residents ayrshire want more bobbies","story":"NewsResidents in Ayrshire want more bobbies on the beatCall for extra funding for frontline officersShareByStephen Houston:,  APR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe majority of residents say there are not enough police officers on the beat, according to a new report .

The public have been advised to stay away from the area and nearby residents should keep their windows closed. Crews are working alongside the Forestry Commission and Police Scotland and will remain on scene until the area is made safe. A rest and welfare facility has been established in the community centre in Dalmellington for any local residents affected by the fire. Assistant Chief Officer for Response and Resilience Lewis Ramsay said: “Our crews across Scotland have had a challenging weekend attending numerous incidents. “Due to the outstanding collaborative working with land owners, The Forestry Commission and Police Scotland we have been able to ensure the safety of our communities. “I would like to thank the wider community for their ongoing support, the hard work of our partners, and the crews on the ground for their tireless efforts.” Firefighters are also still in attendance at a wildfire at Paul’s Hill wind farm near Aberlour. A number of fire engines were mobilised to the area after the call came in at .pm on Saturday, April . A wildfire warning was issued in conjunction with the Scottish Wildfire Forum for this weekend. Wild and grass fires can start by the careless disposal of cigarettes and barbecues or campfires left unattended.They then have the potential to burn for days and devastate vast areas of land, wildle and threaten the welfare of nearby communities - swallowing up emergency service resources. SFRS Area Manager Bruce Farquharson is the chair of the Scottish Wildfire Forum. He said: We saw last year the devastating effect wildfires can have on communities and wildle. The dry and warm weather we are currently experiencing means there is a heightened risk of wildfire across the country. Many rural and remote communities are hugely impacted by wildfires, which can cause signicant environmental and economic damage. Livestock, farmland, wildle, protected woodland and sites of special scientic interest can all be devastated by these fires - as can the lives of people living and working in rural communities. The SFRS works closely with land managers, communities and other safety partners to prevent these incidents ever occurring. Area Manager Farquharson continued: At the start of spring there is often a lot of dead vegetation leftover from last year - this fuel can dry out quickly with higher temperatures and lower humidity levels. A great many people will be enjoying the outdoors in the good weather this weekend, we urge everyone to make sure that they don’t increase the chance of wildfire – be aware of the risks and follow the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. Wildfires are a major threat to our wildle and wild places. We encourage people visiting the outdoors to be extra careful, and check the advice in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code before starting a fire. The public can help prevent wildfires by making sure they dispose of litter and smoking materials carefully while in rural areas.

developing Lowood Estate, ahead of a decision to splash out more than pound million was approved.The report, produced by the property consultancy firm Jones Lang LaSalle , determined that the Lowood portion of the Tweedbank masterplan is ldquounviable and undeliverable and that ldquoit is quite clear that what is proposed is over-development of the site.The damning report, commissioned by Middlemede Properties Ltd, who own the Upper Pavilion fishing beat adjacent to the proposed Lowood development, was presented to SBC chiefs months before the council purchased the land for pound. million in December .Once costs of borrowing and other fees have been factored in, the purchase will cost SBC around pound million and forms parts of its wider plan to address a regional housing shortfall of some  units.The Lowood site has been earmarked for around  properties, however the JLL report suggests that the development is unlikely to yield any financial gain.The report claims: ldquoOur conclusion is that there would be insufficient revenue to generate either a developerrsquos profit or a positive land value.In addition to questioning the economic viability of the development, the JLL report raises concerns that ldquothe level of development and infrastructure proposed would seriously harm the environment and the River Tweed interests from a physical and amenity perspective.Stuart Bell, SBC Councillor for Tweeddale East, told the Borderthat he nor other voting councillors were not given access to the report prior to rubber-stamping the planned purchase of the land.He said: ldquoI was unaware of this report and its conclusions when the decision was taken by Scottish Borders Council to purchase the Lowood Estate.ldquoI think that many other

asking for clarication on why this report was not brought immediately to the attention of councillors.Scottish Borders Council has defended both the report not being tabled and also the purchase of the picturesque estate.A spokesperson said: ldquoThe JLL report was produced as a response to the Housing Supplementary Guidance document which the council was required to produce as part of the Local

We learnt that smallpox dates back to before , BC and came from the Middle East, that Pharaoh Rameses V died in , BC of smallpox. Isabel mentioned lots of other people well-known to history who suffered from smallpox or died of it, including Saint Nicasius, Bishop of Rheims, who, though he was decapitated by the invading Vandals in  AD, in the cathedral he founded, picked up his head and walked to the altar, reciting a psalm. He is the patron saint of smallpox victims.It was called smallpox in the th century to dferentiate it from syphilis, which at that time was known as the great pox. It is a crowd disease that passed by inhalation, though can stay active on clothes, blankets and other objects. So the North American Indian tribes, the Aztecs and the Incas were devastated by smallpox, and the native tribes in Canada were infected by missionaries and priests possibly through donations of bedding or clothes. Itrsquos clear that smallpox was a major disease in Europe from at least the th century, killing at least , people each year and leaving visible evidence of the disease on the faces of millions of others. Smallpox seems to have been taken as inevitable right up until the mid-th century in Britain and only a few lucky iniduals came through it, unspoilt. The Chinese had a defence against it, more than , years ago, by blowing powdered smallpox scabs up the noses of healthy people ndash a form of inoculation. Though reports of this practice reached London in , it wasnrsquot accepted by the medical profession and it was almost  years before Edward Jenner demonstrated the effectiveness of using cowpox to protect people from smallpox.Wikipedia lists six th century acts about vaccination, though itrsquos not clear whether they all affected Scotland: in , making it available free of charge in , making it compulsory for every healthy child the ,  and  acts extending the requirement for children to be compulsorily vaccinated the  act while guaranteeing the right of parents to choose whether to have their baby vaccinated, effectively made it very dficult to avoid. Smallpox was declared to be globally eradicated in . Children are no longer vaccinated so they are potentially at risk,it comes back.

distance.The Eyemouth team also took home the Spirit of Greenpower award in recognition of their teamwork.The event was organised by Greenpower Education Trust, a UK-based charity which gets young people enthusiastic about science and engineering by challenging them to design, build and race an electric car.They supply age-appropriate kit cars, which can be built in school, college or where and raced at motorsport venues at Greenpower-organised events to inspire young people to excel in science, technology, engineering and maths .Commenting on the event, Dave Black said: ldquoIt was a great day out for both teams and to get placed is testament to the effort that pupils from both schools put in, not only racing, but building and maintaining their cars.ldquoPersonally, Irsquom delighted to see how the Greenpower project is expanding within the Borders as I was responsible, along with my students, for building the first Greenpower kit car four years ago.ldquoThe project allows students to develop not only their knowledge and understanding of STEM subjects, but teamwork and cooperation.Mark Catto added: ldquoIt was brilliant watching all three teams supporting and working with each other, and the effort that Dave Black and Paul Watson put into these groups is immense.ldquoOverall, four trophies was a brilliant result considering two of the teams had only been together for a few weeks, and the partnership between Borders College and Eyemouth High School can only go from strength to

Now. That is an urgent task. It is the top of my priorities.\"Secondly, we need to deliver more carriages. That starts next month. We will see more capacity on the Borders Railway as our new rolling stock fleets arrive here in Scotland.\"Thirdly, we need to work with the Scottish Government to see what we can do next to deliver a bigger and better railway for the Borders.\"Mr Hynes also told the meeting that the demand for the Borders Railway is increasing.He said: \"In year one we saw five per cent passenger growth between years two and three that grew to  per cent. Even despite the challenges we have faced in recent months, the demand for the Borders Railway is absolutely huge.\"Once we get all of our high speed trains into service, that will enable us to

Irsquom not yet really old, as Irsquom still in my s, but relative to how young I used to be, Irsquom old by any measure I used in my days of youth.And there seem few benefits in getting older.As one friend recently told me, ldquoIf, at our age, you donrsquot have a pain or ache somewhere, then yoursquore probably deid.But I think there is a tipping point in all this getting old process, whereby you stop resisting the idea, and not only accept it, but embrace it. I think I have reached that point.My age has become a kind of achievement given my lestyle, and I have a deep recognition that every day is something to savour, even when, as is the case as I now write, the weather outside is cold, wet and just miserable.And storytelling is a profession in which getting older is not seen as a disadvantage, because oldness in a storyteller can add a bit more authenticity.But my storytelling profession also highlights my disconnection to what people call progress. Increasingly in my work with children, I am being made aware of the gap between what is going on in technological developments and my knowledge of it.Often in accounts of daily le, things are mentioned by children and I have absolutely no idea what they are. Usually they are new computer games or computer technology.These games are so much part of so many childrenrsquos lives that when I ask what they are they find it incredible that I have no knowledge of them.One of them responded cheekily, but in an affectionate manner, ldquoTim do you live in a cave In a sense I suppose I do. I am lucky to have a young family as well as a grown up one, and that keeps me young at heart. But so far I have managed to resist the computer game thing, although I know how addictive it can be because I recently I tried a game once in a friendrsquos house.I felt a bit like Frodo Baggins when he put on the ring. Something took over my soul and for a moment I was being taken over by an uncontrollable desire. I didnrsquot actually say the words ldquomy precious screen when I was forced to leave, but that is how I felt.In one way, my lack of experience with this kind of technology makes me feel old and disconnected from the modern world but, on the other hand, it makes me feel relieved and even privileged that I grew up in an age when such toxic distractions from living le were simply not available.I remember climbing trees, mucking about at the beach, playing in the garden till it got dark, making dens, cycling on an old bike that had been thrown away, going round for pals basically being almost constantly outside and usually dirty when I finally came home. No wonder children assume there was no electricity in the days of my youth, because when I describe it, there is an absence of devices.I did, of course, watch TV, but programmes were limited, no morning TV for example, and childrenrsquos TV was over by teatime. The outdoors was ldquomy precious and being bored was a motivation to make a game with pals not switch on a screen.Only now, looking back, do I realise just how much a privilege it was to have a childhood free of this screen addiction. It simply wasnrsquot an option so there was no sense of loss or missing out.But now with a young family I wonder how much longer I can hold out.After a trip to North Berwick the other day I was asked by my youngest daughter, ldquoWhat are those things on the seat  as she peered into a car parked next to ours at a supermarket car park.They were the frame holdersfor ipads, so the children can watch films or play games while in the car. I realised my daughter had no idea that such a thing was possible!I explained how it was much better to sing songs, tell stories, play word games and look out the window and play ldquoI spy. She nodded her head, but Irsquom not sure she was convinced.I know Irsquom coming across as an old self righteous dinosaur. I do realise, of course, that the ldquogood old days were not all good.I also understand that kids, indeed le itself, can be hard work, and all this new technology can help make our lives easier. It can help us keep us entertained and connected in a dferent way, and make information easier to get.But even still, when children look at me in horror when I explain the absence of technology in my childhood and they ask me, ldquobut what did you do, I feel a sense of sadness that we have allowed the giants of IT multinationals to steal the imaginations, and the precious childhood time, of our children and future generations.In that sense I think storytellers are needed perhaps more than ever. I remain happy living in my ldquocave. And when it is finally time for my own lights to go out, I hope I will have left a trail of stories and experiences.In the end, surely, that legacy is worth more than a thousand computer games played."},{"url":null,"title":"ambitious-plans-revealed-for-the-bell","story":"Kurt Edwards and Laura McSweeney will step behind the bar at The Bell next month, with plans for a fresh outlook and a name change.Mr Edwards and Miss McSweeney are behind Eats on the Green, which handles catering at Haddington Golf Club, with Graeme Flick set to become head chef at the pub, which was previously The Railway Hotel.Thirty-eight-year-old Mr Edwards said: ldquoWe have got children and we found there was a need for a family pub in East Lothian.ldquoWe had been going to The Pine Marten in Dunbar but there was nowhere for us take the children.ldquoI spoke to Greene Kingand we came up with the idea to put in a play area upstairs and they were all for it.The trio will officially be handed the keys on April  and will put in a new till system and run the business until the end of the month.Then, the final bell will toll for The Bell, with a new name of The Green when the business reopens.Mr Edwards said there would be a similar outlook at the Court Street business as to their business at the golf club, with an emphasis on ldquoworking with local suppliers, everything made in house and tasty food.He added: ldquoWe are going to lose the big screen television upstairs.ldquoIt was just not working and we are going to get a couple of screens downstairs.ldquoUpstairs will be more of a family environment and we are going to change the bar and add a coffee machine.ldquoThere will be cakes and sweet stuff, plus alcohol.ldquoDownstairs will be more of a pub and we will have a food offering sothere is a game on you can get a pint and a meal during the game.A spokeswoman for Greene King wished the new parties well.She said: ldquoWersquore thrilled that Kurt and Laura have agreed to take on The Bell and we wish them all the best with their new venture.ldquoWe made a signicant investment in this pub in recent years and wersquove spent time recruiting the right partners who we believe can take the pub forward and continue to ensure its success at the heart of Haddington.Haddington and Lammermuir ward member Councillor Tom Trotter also wished those involved the best of luck.He said: ldquoYou go further down the street and see what has happened to some of the pubs.ldquoHopefully, they get a turn and make a success of it.Meanwhile, The Victoria Inn, which is also owned by Greene King, remains on the market after a potential buyer fell through."},{"url":null,"title":"trios-delight-at-being-named-members-of-scottish-youth-parliament","story":"Adnan Ros and Nathaniel de Havilland will represent East Lothian, with Erin Campbell representing Midlothian North and Musselburgh.

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see. Historical truth can be an elusive creature. You think you have grasped it when suddenly it slips away, leaving you searching once again. And sometimes a lost historical truth is to be found hidden in a legend.In the tale of St Andrewrsquos relics, history will side with the abbot, I suspect, but the romanticised and dramatic tale of St Rule has become the more popular and well-known explanation.But the reason for this is another story in itself.With thanks to Anna Blair, whose tale lsquoSaint and Saltirersquo inspired my research into this story."},{"url":null,"title":"council-planners-accused-of-having-a-lack-of-knowledge-of-their-own-policy","story":"A planning application to build the three-bedroom home and a detached garage on the outskirts of Camptoun Holdings, a small hamlet two miles north of Haddington, was refused by the local authority for the second time in five years.However, the applicants have now lodged an appeal in which they claim the planning officer who turned them down did not understand the policyused to make that decision.They claim that the house, which would be built on land currently occupied by derelict agricultural buildings, should be classed as an ldquoenabling development because they say it would improve the area.In an appeal which will be heard by the councilrsquos Local Review Body next month, they state: ldquoThe planner, in the pre-application response, did not accept that the proposed development was an enabling development.ldquoHowever, it is submitted that this conclusion only serves to demonstrate the lack of knowledge of the development process.ldquoTo allow for the removal of derelict buildings and reclamation of an unkempt siterequires third-party intervention.ldquoThe applicant is submitting a proposal for a single dwelling house and garage absorbing the costs of demolition and reclamation.ldquoThe development will bring substantial improvements to this rural brownfield land and improve landscape quality as well as visual and residential amenity.East Lothian Council has a planning policy which bars new housing in the countryside unless exceptional circumstances can be established.The plans for a house at Camptoun Holdings were first lodged with the council in .On that occasion they were refused and the Local Review Body rejected an appeal.Agents for the applicants this time around will argue that there has been a change in circumstances at the site, which has deteriorated further over the years.The Local Review Body meets in Haddington on Thursday, May ."},{"url":null,"title":"new-exhibition-highlights-history-of-musselburgh-athletic-fc","story":"The display was officially opened by Billy Brown, a former Hearts and Bradford City manager, who comes from Musselburgh and is a former Musselburgh Athletic manager, at a reception in the Old Town Hall.On show at the High Street museum is a iety of memorabilia relating to lsquoThe Burghrsquo, including trophies, medals, strips, pennants and photographs.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

And, as her quarter of a million Twitter followers will attest, only tennis ranks above her love of cakes. So, although she didnrsquot elaborate on the outcome of the altercation, I can only imagine Ms Murray volleyed back as good as she got and ended up persuading the shop to accept Euros, groats and Monopoly money as well as Scottish cash.The tweet got so much traction because most Scots know and understand exactly how this interaction goes, just how grim and maddening it is no matter how many times yoursquove experienced it. These days many of us feel much more confident in our skins as Scots and are able to consider and reconcile our relationship with our English neighbours in more mature and expansive ways than ever before. But you still canrsquot escape the deep, primeval humiliation of having your money refused.

To give him his due, Irsquod usually get a wink and a free drink, too.The irony of all this, of course, is the fact that the banknotes so many of us defend to the end at cash desks all over England, day in, day out, are not legal tender at all. Not even in Scotland, as it turns out, where only coins have legal weight. According to the Bank of England, both coins and Bank of England notes are legal tender south of the border, with anything  a ldquomatter of agreement between the parties involved. This means each and every one of those painful refusals was legitimate, every ldquoput that in your pipe and smoke it, pal righteous speech made by you was nonsense.

But in a speech to transport experts he went further, and said all its assets should be devolved too.It would mean responsibility for both trains and tracks coming together under the Scottish Government, allowing for more efficient, joined up decision-making.He said it would be ldquoabsurdHighways England was also responsible for motorways in Scotland, yet a single UK-wide body still owned and managed the rail lines north of the border, despite transport and Scotlandrsquos train franchises being devolved.The plan would require UK government approval and a Treasury write-off of at least the Scottish element of Network Railrsquos poundbn debt.Mr Harris is understood to have floated the idea to the Williams Rail Review, which he advises through a place on its expert challenge .Set up in September under former British Airways boss Keith Williams, the review is the most far-reaching shake-up of rail services in the UK since privatisation almost  years.When it reports this autumn, its recommendations on the structure of the industry and priorities for passengers and freight will automatically become government policy.At present, rail in Scotland is a mix of the devolved and the reserved.Transport Scotland oversees the train operating franchises, but rail infrastructure is owned and run by Network Rail, a UK-wide body under the UK Transport Secretary.This split responsibility has been highlighted by the decline in ScotRailrsquos performance, as around half of its problems are due to faults on Network Rail, not the trains.Mr Harris, a Glasgow MP from  to , said civil servants in London or at Network Railrsquos Milton Keynes base should not be making crucial decisions about rail infrastructure in Scotland.He said: ldquoI have long been of the view that the maximum amount of devolution should be applied to the management of Network Rail in Scotland.ldquoThis Rail Review gives us an opportunity to go even further.ldquoNo one believes that Highways England should have ownership or responsibility for the motorway network here in Scotland: it is owned and maintained by the Scottish Government and it would be absurd to propose any alternative structure.ldquoWe now have an opportunity to create a separate status for the railways in Scotland, with all infrastructure - the lines, the signalling and the stations - owned by an entirely separate organisation from Network Rail, just as Transport Scotland is separate from Highways England.ldquoThis would simply and speed up management decisions about our infrastructure, which should have no impact whatever on the broader GB industry and which, therefore, doesnrsquot need oversight by a GB-based body like Network Rail.Mr Harris told the Herald: ldquoMy views on the devolution of Network rail are well known. They have been in the public domain for some years. Naturally people will look at those comments and see that I have gone a step further. but itrsquos entirely up to Keith Williams and the Expert Challenge Panel whether they want to take my comments on board.The Scottish Government said: ldquoThe Scottish Government has made no secret of our repeated calls to the Secretary of State for Transport that Network Rail s should be devolved to Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliament, and we welcome the growing support for that position. We fund Network Rail in Scotland, set its objectives, yet lack proper influence over its operations and that must change. The UK Rail Review, under the leadership of Keith Williams, will provide an opportunity to deliver real and meaningful structural change in Scotland.

He ignores the powerful propaganda effect of cutting out any evidence of SNP contribution to Brexit debates in Westminster from TV news bulletins and suggests that fairness exists in the opportunity, later, to dig around other TV channels and archives to find them. He must have missed the whipping and gerrymandering techniques employed by the Tory Party, and deplored by the Speaker himself, on several other occasions to deny opposing speakers, especially the SNP, the right to speak at all ndash especially on the Withdrawal Act itself.The irony of suggesting that Ms Cook misjudges the situation by viewing Scotland from France through ldquorose-coloured glasses while claiming that Theresa May has little or no responsibility for the horrible saga of the Withdrawal Agreement, blaming it on the civil service, lies deep. Describing that ladyrsquos behaviour as courageous rather than manically relentless as we are driven thickly towards the madness of a constitutionally illegal Meaningful Vote  next week and a last-minute European election campaignseems fancul and fantastic, rose-coloured thinking indeed.Thank goodness for Fidelma Cook. Thank goodness for the cooling effect of irony. If Westminster had not sunk so deeply into chaos under this administration andthe prospects were not so dangerous, Mr Burleigh might even have made us smile.Frances McKie, Ash Hill, Evanton, Ross-shire.I HAVE never before submitted a letter to The Herald, or any other national newspaper for that matter, but I cannot allow Archie Burleighs absurd comments to go unchallenged.In the first instance, as a retired newspaper reporterI can assure Mr Burleigh that The Herald does not employ \"hacks\". On the contrary, its editorial team includes some of the most talented journalists and informed columnists in the business and Fidelma Cook is no exception.Secondly, he asserts that the Prime Ministers parliamentary party is \"probably the most truly representative\" of the opinions of the entire country with so many isions apparent. That is, at best, a moot point, but it is those very isions within the Conservative Party that lie at the heart of the Brexit madness.Yes, there have always been Euro-sceptics within the Labour Party and there is clear evidence that some members of the SNP also voted Leave in that ill-conceived referendum. But this is primarily a Conservative Party problem and has plagued a succession of Tory Party leaders for decades. What tipped David Camerons hand and prompted him to make a mad dash to the polls was the emergence of Ukipand the threat it was beginning to pose to Tory seats. Lastly, I would say to Mr Burleigh,hes concerned about paid \"hacks\" offering opinions which I assume are contrary to his own, he should spare a thought for others whose attempts at rational debate are constantly undermined by the pro-Brexit bilge pumped out on a daily basis by the hacks employed on some of the English-based right-wing press.James Cuthbert,Drumellan Road,Alloway, Ayr.IM going to leap quickly in defence of the Letters Editor, obviously in the hope of currying favour, after Archie Burleighs letter today.Mr Burleigh complains that Fidelma Cook has a guaranteed place in the opinion firmament while ordinary mortals have to jump through editorial hoops to see our opinions published in the Letters Pages. I too frequently have contributions ignored, to my disappointment, but its usually clear that the topic has moved on or that others have said it better.However, as for Mr Burleighs suggestion that Ms Cook, domiciled in France, sees Scotlands position in Europe through rose-tinted glasses au contraire, as Fidelma might say. I suggest that from a distance the Brexit farce, and its threat to Scotlands economy, is only too painfully clear.Mr Burleigh quotes Harry S Truman, \"progress occurs when courageous skilful leaders seize the opportunity to change things for the better\".

Perhaps Mr Burleigh will enlighten us by explaining the dference between a paid hack living in France and a well-respected professional journalist living in the European Union. I would suggest that to qualy for the latter characterisation it would be necessary for the paid hack to express views in line with those of Mr Burleigh.Willie Maclean, Braehead Avenue, Milngavie.THE agreement between the European Union and the UK to extend Article  until the end of October has rightly been welcomed by business leaders across theand breadth of these islands.

Indeed, the problem for environmentalists, in the West at least, is perhaps that theyrsquove been too successful. The science of climate change is now more or less universally accepted, since the BBC started banning climate-change deniers like Lord Lawson from the Today programme. If everyone more or less agrees, therersquos no controversy.Civil disobedience, and stunts like superglueing naked bottoms to the safety glass in the House of Commons, at least gets attention. Politicians insist that they are listening . The UK is, perhaps surprisingly, one of the world leaders in CO reduction, and emissions are now lower than in Victorian times. The Scottish Government is committed to net  per cent elimination of greenhouse gases by , and has exceeded its emissions targets since it began the process of decarbonisation a decade ago. Admittedly, this is largely down to the closure of coal-fired power stations, like Longannet, and there remain problems with home heating and transport.:Extinction Rebellion protests: The activists who plan further disruption in Scotland to prevent environmental destructionThe electrication of vehicles is moving forward ndash though much too slowly because of the lack of charging points across Scotland. But it is happening. Petrol and diesel cars are to be phased out after . In fact, the internal combustion engine may become obsolete in towns some time before that, so rapid is the development of electric vehicles, especially micro-transportation like electric scooters and e-bikes. Buses and lorries, though, are another matter, and diesels are defended by powerful economic interests like the road hauliers and distribution companies like Amazon.Climate protesters like thecolumnist George Monbiot insist that we must ldquooverthrow capitalism to save the planet. But technology is turning the market green at a remarkable rate. The cost of renewable energy has fallen faster than anyone could have imagined  years ago. According to the investor bible, Forbes, solar and wind energy is about to make coal, gas and even nuclear power obsolete in the West in the next couple of years. It says three-quarters of US coal-fired power stations are already uneconomic, despite Donald Trumprsquos promotion of coal. Therersquos even talk of imminent estment in loss-making fossil fuel stocks causing a global financial ldquocorrection or stock market crash.Read more: Climate protestors block Edinburgh streetHowever, the Extinction Rebellion protesters are right to warn against complacency. The battle against climate change is far from over. President Trump disgraced America by withdrawing from the Paris Climate agreement. But the US is not the worldrsquos worst polluter. The inconvenient truth, as Al Gore might put it, is that protests against climate chaos are futilecountries like China continue to open a coal-powered station nearly every week.There has been much dispute about this claim, which environmentalists say is a racist myth designed to sht the blame for climate change to a developing country. However, there is no doubt that the second-largest economy in the world is also the biggest single polluter. China is responsible for one-third of global CO emissions, and thatrsquos largely down to its anachronistic dependence on burning coal.One of the greatest obstacles in the way of meeting  Paris climate target of capping global warming to two per cent above pre-industrial levels , is the persistent use of coal, largely in south-east Asia. China currently consumes half the worldrsquos coal and has increased coal-powered capacity by  per cent since , according to the International Energy Agency .True, China is also emerging as a world leader in renewable energy and is opening huge solar farms by the week. But promises by the communist government to curb coal use have not been honoured. According to the Global Energy Monitor, China is in the process of adding  gigawatts of coal-fired power, equivalent to the entire capacity of US coal. Hence the claim that it is opening a coal plant every week.The IEA say that to meet the UN targets, China would have to close all its coal-fired power stations within the next  years. That isnrsquot going to happen. Indeed, according to the German environment and human rights NGO, Urgewald, China is busy exporting coal-fired power stations to at least  countries, from Kenya to the Balkans. In Serbia, Chinese companies are building the countryrsquos first coal-fired power plant in  years.And itrsquos not just China. The IEA estimate that Asia as a whole is becoming coal central, with hundreds of coal power stations in the pipeline. Indonesia and Vietnam are turning to coal as are Bangladesh, and with Chinese help, the Philippines. Japan has ed to burning more coal following the disaster at Fukushima nuclear plant in . Without the active involvement of these countries, then the efforts of countries like the UK will be in vain. And of course in communist countries like China, climate protesters would be in jail, not on the streets campaigning.Developing countries have a strong case for special treatment. They can legitimately claim that the current warmth of the planet is not their fault. China has only become an industrialised nation in the last  years, whereas we in the West have been pumping C into the atmosphere since the start of the industrial revolution  years ago. Living standards are poor for the vast majority of ordinary Chinese families, who consume only a fraction of the goods and services we enjoy in the UK. Chinese citizens, therefore, have a much smaller carbon footprint.These are strong arguments and are recognised by the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change. Despite Americarsquos objections, there may have to be resource transfers to developing nations,they are to curb their uneconomic coal use. This is a global problem demanding global action and time is running out.

Developing future capability and talent in STEM and digital skills is a key focus area for BP and important for the continued success of our industry. BP is pleased to once again sponsor this fantastic initiative and we wish all the participating schools the best of luck.”Neil Gordon, chief executive of Subsea UK said: “It is crucial to continue inspiring the next generation of engineers through creative initiatives which incorporate STEM subjects such as this highly regarded competition.“Each year sees a high calibre of entrants developing a vehicle which tests their abilities and enhances their academic knowledge at the same time. It also provides a  for the pupils to develop critical le skills such as problem-solving and teamwork. We wish everyone involved the very best of luck.”Douglas Middleton, Operations Director said: “The MATE ROV competition is a valuable initiative for both participating students and companies, like ROVOP, who support the programme.It gives practical insight into underwater technology and introduces pupils to the exciting opportunities available in the subsea sector.

Radiocarbon dating of the dog bones unearthed at Cuween has shown that the dogs were placed in the chamber more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting that they were ritually buried.Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said: “Just as they’re treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.“But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago.#Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the ‘dog people’.“While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.“Looking at this dog helps us better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals, people whose ingenuity and sophistication made Orkney such an important place in the Neolithic and who have left us with such a rich legacy of monuments today.”The canine reconstruction is part of a wider project to use cutting-edge technology to share the stories of Orkney’s Neolithic chambered tombs with visitors.Last year, HES published D digital models of these chambered cairns, created through photogrammetry to better reveal the sophisticated structure of these monuments with the public.This process involves taking hundreds of overlapping images which are then combined to create a D model, enabling users from anywhere in the world to explore the sites in detail online.All of this new research will form part of updated interpretation  for visitors to Orkney’s chambered cairns, including Cuween Hill, due to be installed this summer. The reconstruction itself will also be going on display in Orkney later this year.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Their guests are interested in all types of accommodation, from hotels and guesthouses, to BBs and self-catering, and most will arrive with their own or hired cars.#They have the flexibility to explore areas off the busy, well-beaten tracks and taking a local guide with them or booking a private or scheduled tour is a popular way to do this.#She added: #Once operators understand how much there is to see and do in Orkney and how many islands there are, in addition to the wonderful food, drink and crafts we have, they appreciate why we recommend three to four-night stays as a minimum for their guests.”Ms Tulloch said that Destination Orkney hoped to build on the opportunities the travel trade industry was now offering to Orkney by running future workshops for tourism members locally.“We’d like all our members to be aware of the potential this section of the industry presents and to equip them with the necessary tools and knowledge they will needthey would like to work effectively with the travel trade,” she explained.Joining Ms Tulloch on the Orkney stand at the Expo were travel trade consultant, Kathleen Hogarth, Destination Orkney members Hazel Aim and Fidra Sym of Orkney Heritage Tours, and Destination Orkney chairman and hotelier Gareth Crichton.Expo was also attended by Pentland Ferries, NorthLink Ferries, John O’ Groats Ferries and representatives from Shetland, forming a strong presence for the Northern Isles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the event of any archaeological discoveries of interest, SSEN Transmission has said it is committed to ensuring these are fully documented, preservedpossible, with the findings shared with interested parties.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Our national conversation has demonstrated that in recent months, when dferences of opinion on political issues have raised the public temperature to an uncomfortably high level. We are riven we are confused we are angry with one another we are unhappy. Gone are the days, it seems, when people could hold dfering views and yet agree about the common good.In such circumstances, we might remember the things that we used to argue about in Scotland – the old dferences of opinion that now seem to be bathed in a warm glow of nostalgia. Perhaps we can ert ourselves from our current toxic exchanges by thinking about those comfortable old arguments and debates. How pleasant they were by comparison how gorgeously irrelevant how innocent.Such as: how does one pronounce Gullane  There are those who consider that question otiose in our troubled times, but no, that controversy is never going to go away, andanything is going to distract us from present woes, it is that one. In future, when somebody asks you your view of the European Union issue, smile politely and say, “Ah, but how does one pronounce Gullane ” That question has saved many Scottish dinner parties from becoming mired in heated debate about Article . It is, in a sense, a lightning conductor, keeping tempers down and saving friendships. It is, after all, possible to disagree with somebody about the pronunciation of Gullane without consigning them to Dantean regions below.For the benefit of those south of the Border, the pronunciation of Gullane is a sort of Scottish Schleswig-Holstein question . It has been around for a long time and in the minds of many it has yet to be resolved. You would think that people would have better things to think about, but they do not. The pronunciation of Gullane is a defining issue for some it goes to the very core of their social identity.: The Edinburgh of the future will have no residents and an all-year festival – Alexander McCall SmithThe issue is this. There are two principal ways of pronouncing Gullane. One is Gillin, the other is Gullin. There are other possibilities, of course, including Gillane and Gullane. It will be noticed that the latter is also the way it is spelled, which of course has no relevance. The name Garioch, for instance, is pronounced Gairy, at least by some, including many who are called Garioch. Then there is Milngavie, which is pronounced in the way in which Milngavie is pronounced, which is Mul Guy. Hawick is, of course, Hoyick, and those pronouncing it as it is spelled will not get far in the Borders. These are all well-known oddities that have so far survived European Union harmonisation. Beware, though: the aries who are intent on abolishing summer time are planning an orthography pronunciation directive that will require names to be pronounced in the way in which they are spelled. That may not be true – it probably isn’t – but stranger things have happened.Back to Gullane. The interesting thing about the pronunciation issue there is that it reflects a social ide. Broadly speaking, the Uppies say Gillin and the Doonies say Gullin. Those boundaries are not absolute, but it is generally the case. So at one level it is akin to the dference between table-napkin and serviette – a distinction that seems to fascinate the English but that is of scant interest here in Scotland. We have the Gillin Gullin controversy, which is far more interesting – and important.: Alexander McCall Smith: Edinburgh Airport should charge people to sit downWhat do the people of Gullane themselves say  Well, the first point to be made there is that this should not be decisive. It is perfectly possible for people to get the name of their own place wrong, and to continue to do so against all the advice of professional etymologists. Sometimes, in fact, people get their own surnames wrong: I have met Macleans abroad who actually call themselves Mackleen. That raises delicate etiquette issues. How do you tell people that they are getting their own name wrong  It is very dficult. The only way of doing it tactfully is to simply look pained, or even wince, when they introduce themselves. That will usually cause them to realise that something is amiss and seek expert advice on how to pronounce their name correctly.Gullane is, alas, seriously ided. As you drive through the village on your way towards North Berwick , people who live on the right side of the road say Gullin, while those on the left say Gillin. That ide is regrettable, but it is very dficult to see how it can be overcome. Gillin is a shibboleth. At Muirfield, which is just outside the village, there is no question but that it is Gillin. Cadit quaestio. Choosing, then, to say Gullin,one has been brought up to say Gillin, becomes an act of self-definition, a gesture of rejection of the constraints of tribalism. Gullin is, for such people, a protestation of independence, an identication with the authentic political and social culture of Scotland, which leans towards Gullin. Of course nobody may notice the gesture, but at least it is made, and those who make it report that they do indeed feel more authentic for saying Gullin rather than Gillin.Many outsiders do not realise how important this issue is and how it exercises people in Scotland. That is because they are inauthentic. And as for the answer to the question of what is the correct pronunciation, that, as is well-known, is self-evident.

No leave option.#Put it to the people#.!Thought they did ..!Very proud of the Shetlands for making a stand. If only every town in the UK stood as tall. Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #. The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed. It will take us, at least, ten years to rejoin, accepting the euro, the Common FIsheries Policy and austerity invoking budget restrictions to manage our large budget deficit.So why is the SNP stamping about, #greetin der een oot#, about Scots #being dragged out of the UK against their wishes#, when their defining policy, independence, will take us out, unlikely, ever to rejoin Humbug!# EA_Scotland_and_the_EU#Whether or not one is in favour of Brexit, how many people truly knew what they were voting for in   Misinformation and disinformationflew about like panic stricken puffins and some politicians loved it.So much of what was involved came to light over the time which has elapsed and STILL confusion reigns. Thank goodness the leadership during the Second World War was not as pathetic as the present incumbents are.Meanwhile, those nations over the other side of the English Channel must be wondering why the Brits are allowing themselves to be so humiliated ..What about the  that stayed away# So very true today.Spot on Ian !! Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn.

Instead, the Electoral Commission fined us on technicalities and an overspend of £,, not the £, originally presented by them on £ million overall spend. The fines were reduced and the Judge accepted the technical breaches were ‘mistakes’ rather than calculated wrong-doings and crucially held there were ‘no findings that Leave.EU had been dishonest.#”#.Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats  Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee:The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers. Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .My final word here . Given a choice of Nigel Farage, Johnathon Wills or Gary RobinsonI would choose Farage without question. Ex Councillors with a history of outright dishonestyor complete turncoat behaviour , Farage for me warts and all, any time.I do not agree with all Farage has done and said, but I find no lack of integrity in him, which in the atmosphere of today#s politics is refreshing.I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.I totally agree with your comments, Michael. It certainly has put the Conservatives into a situation where it has caused ision and political mayhem within the government as well as affecting, to a degree, other political parties. It has also weakened the basis for leaving the EU, and the aftermath, politically and economically, and the mess which has occurred thereafter. On the outset, from what I know, it did not make economic sense to leave the EU, based on the feedback, prior to the EU Ref from many British companies trading within the EU, and the possible damage it would cause  I believe % of British trade was directly with the EU, and now this figure could be vastly reduced as a consequence We are, the UK, in uncharted waters, so to speak, and it could, possibly, take years to smooth out or cause greater calamity with the EU. I hope the future relationship with the EU, does not have a negative impact on trading relationships######time shall tell, as they say. It has put the future of the EU in doubt, as other countries within the EU, also wanting to have referendums  A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace.You mean the mega rich that made their fortune by evading tax and suing the NHS because they didn#t get a contract  folk like Richard Branson the prominent remoaner. Or geldof who lives in the UK tax free under non dom status Or Osbourne, Cameron, Salmond, Blaire!! I wish I was poor like them!It was a simple question. Only those who do not like the result try and pretend otherwise.#Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union #If #leave the European Union# somehow, as you try to convince us, can be interpreted as only leaving certain bits of the EU, then the same must also apply to the alternative choice of#remain a member of the European Union# and it be interpreted as only remaining within certain bits of the EU. Which would have made asking the question in the first place meaningless and pointless, as regardless which way anyone chose to vote it meant the same thing.#Leave the European Union# and #remain a member of the European Union# can only be interpreted one way, as per the dictionary definition, as the question contains no caveats. Besides, being the good old Socialists that they are in their mission to list, label and micro manage everything, you#re either a full member of the EU or you#re not. There is no mechanism or precedent to sorta half leave, but not leave everything, like you suggest. Fully in, or fully out, them be the choices.I think Michael will have to agree it doesn’t appear to be a question Parliament wanted this answer to! Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more. It’s a really big tangle because ultimately for the U.K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. For Scotland apparently it is the people that’s sovereign, so there may be a clash ahead. I’m not sure how many people voted to break up the U.K. Maybe the only solution now will be to have a confirmatory vote.#Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more#.Really  What are the choices then  Like I said above, those are the only two available where the EU is concerned. Which is a goodish chunk of the reason some of us voted out, you either accept everything that Brussels dictates, or reject everything Brussels dictates, participating in the things that work in your country and rejecting those which don#t isn#t an option. The EEC EU worked up to a point while some level of give and take was possible with such things, now that its not, the EU are on a fast track to implosion civil war, whichever arrives first.“What are the choices ” No idea, but, from the news, No-Deal is now No-Go.Sorryfolk were misled, but why is no-deal seemingly now no-go  Its because we vote for MPs, and they do what they think they should, not what we want. It’s a sair fecht, but most MPs seemingly want to spare the country needless economic damage the people didn’t knowingly vote for. That’s then doing their jobs btw.Lets wait and see nowa compromise emerges that Parliament can live with, orthey can agree a question they need to put to the people.MPs are our representatives, put there to do what they think is best. They are not our servents put there to mindlessly do our bidding. This key fact allows them the wriggle room they need to change their minds once the facts change. This reality behind our representative democracy illuminates the lie that was Cameron’s “advisory referendum” which, funnily enough, he promised to obey. You’ve got to love those Tories# or not. No-deal was a fake promise, which, happily for some, still distracts attention from the many harms of needless austerity. Let’s face it, Brexit never really meant Leave..."},{"url":null,"title":"footballers portraits to be auctioned as fundraiser for under 12s ","story":"Four paintings of footballers are available in the auction with all money raised going towards travel costs for the Shetland under-s trip to Glasgow for the Glasgow City Cup.Artist Balazs Onhausz with his football-inspired art. page.People can bid for the works up until th May with coaches hoping to raise around £, or £ per artwork.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/whfp-retrospective-150x150.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733279.jpg--.jpg?1555495975000\n","title":"ballymena young conquerors spring concert","story":"BALLYMENA Young Conquerors Flute Band will be holding its annual concert on Thursday, May  in the Braid Arts Centre Ballymena, commencing at . pm.The band is the town’s oldest surviving music group, having been formed in .

It spreads either through direct contact with an infected person or through the air when the patient coughs or sneezes.“It causes high fever and rash that usually passes in about seven to ten days without causing further problems, but it can also be very serious, with some people developing complications, such as infections of the ears, lungsand brain .“Unfortunately, people can die from measles. The video aims to highlight the signs and symptoms and inform that the safest and most effective way to prevent measles is to ensure you are fully vaccinated with the MMR vaccine.”Due to lower levels of MMR vaccine uptake in children and young people in some countries, measles continues to circulate. Anyone who has not received two doses of MMR vaccine is at risk. The MMR vaccine has proven to be a safe and effective way to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella.“Thanks to the high proportion of people in Northern Ireland making the positive decision to get the MMR vaccine over the past decades, cases of these three illnesses here have fallen signicantly. However, these diseases have not gone away and some countries are experiencing outbreaks of measles.“The MMR vaccine is available free of charge as part of the routine immunisation schedule. Children should receive one dose of MMR just after their first birthday and a second dose at three years and four months of age. Anyone who is not surethey are fully-vaccinated should check with their GP practice. If you haven’t had your kids vaccinated, contact your GP surgery to make arrangement for them to get the MMR and help to provide them and those around them with the best protection.”The initial symptoms of measles can include: a runny or blocked nose sneezing sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light a high temperaturea cough.To view the video see www.pha.site MMRvimeoFor more information on measles, mumps and rubella see www.pha.site mmr.PHA programme to tackle type  diabetes Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"pha programme to tackle type 2 diabetes","story":"A new programme to tackle the increasing prevalence of type  diabetes has been launched by the Public Health Agency.

Type  diabetes accounts for  per cent of all cases and is a serious and progressive condition. The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new diabetes prevention programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor. Trudy Brown, regional type  diabetes prevention programme manager at the PHA, said: “Often, by making simple changes to lestyle, losing weight, adopting a healthier diet and increasing physical activity, people can alter a type two diabetes diagnosis or at least postpone it signicantly.”Participant on the Newtownards programme, Margaret McAllister, aged , discovered she was pre-diabetic via a routine blood test. She said: “Being diagnosed as pre-diabetic was a shock but also an important warning call. “I was then given an opportunity to take part in the diabetes prevention programme. The facilitators offer advice and support to help you make changes to your lestyle and I quickly realised I was eating all the wrong foods and also too much of them.

It literally has changed my le.”Diabetes UK assistant director for local impact, Dr David Chaney, said: “We only have to look at the startling yearly increase in number of people being diagnosed with type  diabetes to know that we cannot ignore this very serious condition. We know that three in five cases of type  can be prevented or delayed by eating well, being active and achieving a healthy weight, so there is hope for the future. The more we know about diabetes the better we can fight it together, so find outyou are at risk and ask about your local diabetes prevention programme.”The diabetes prevention programme is currently up and running across all five trust areas. People can be referred to the programme by a nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.

Situated in Antrim’s hills, the Crumlin derives its name from the Irish ‘An Cromghlinn’, meaning The Crooked Glen, which is the name adopted by one the town’s most exciting new pubs.Headed up by North Belfast businessman Laurence Burns and his brother Damien, The Crooked Glen is bringing the original meaning of the name Crumlin back into everyday use in the town and breathing new le into one of the Main Street’s most prominent buildings.Laurence has spent the last -years leading operations at the popular city centre nightclub, Thompson’s Garage, and has also worked on a number of the city’s biggest events and festivals, including our own Best of the North awards ceremony. However, when the opportunity to run his own bar and restaurant arose he jumped at the opportunity, and while aiming to bring something new to the area he said paying homage to the town’s Irish-speaking heritage was vital.“I was always trying to keep my ear to the ground so that when a pub came up I would be in contention for it,” he said.“I had done that through Jeeves Limited and then the opportunity came up just before Christmas.“There was an opportunity for me to take it on – along with my brother who is my business partner – and give it a wee bit more care and attention.“It had been O’Connor’s twice before under two dferent businesses. The previous owner was O’Connor and the guy who took it on firstly was O’Connor, so I didn’t want to be the third O’Connor’s and that’s where the Crooked Glen came into it. There’s a big Irish speaking community up in Crumlin and I just thought they would appreciate that the name came from Irish origins. That’s where the name came from and it has gotten a really good response.“I got a logo and then used the boys from North Belfast Graphic to implement the artwork outside on the walls, the menus, and all the rest of it.”He continued: “I fell in love with it the first time I came into it. I just loved the character of it.“The first time I came in was as a customer, I sat downstairs and had a bit of craic with a few of the locals who are now my regulars. They were giving me a bit of stick and saying thatyou’re eating in here you have to keep the fire filled up. We were just having a bit of banter – I actually did get up and put a bit of coal on the fire. I hadn’t even seen upstairs at that stage, but I had my lunch and said to Damien that I had a really good feeling about the place. I knew I liked it right away, I had a feeling for it and I could see the potential.”In terms of its space, The Crooked Glen has it all – a cosy fireside bar, a beautul upstairs restaurant and a fantastic outdoor area. In the short six weeks since taking over the venue, the Burns brothers have implemented an exciting new menu, improved service standards and have lined up a number of talented artists for their weekly live music sessions.“The responses and reviews that I’m getting is that we’ve taken a bit of creativity from Belfast and brought it up into Crumlin – that’s no disrespect to anything that was already up here,” Laurence said.“It’s the first time that things have been done in this way up here. In the restaurant it will be a bit more of a service led experience, downstairs is your good hearty pub grub with the music, the fire and the pints, upstairs you have a bit more of a refined dining experience.”By offering everything from food to live music and sports, The Crooked Glen aims to have “something for everybody” in the town.“I don’t think Crumlin has had that calibre of musician here on a regular basis. We want to bring the best of what we can afford here, we can’t charge on the door, but we’ll put on the best music possible with a ied selection on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”He added: “Crumlin sometimes feels like you’re in Donegal because it has that country village feeling, but you’re also on the doorstep of Belfast, so people are used to going in and out of the city and sampling what it has to offer.“We’re trying to take the good things that are in Belfast and the good things of village le in Crumlin and combine them into what should be a strong brand in the Crooked Glen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Noel-.png","title":"the day when the bovedy trailed above our heads","story":"Former De La Salle pupil Noel Connor explains the background to his exhibition The Bovedy Illuminations which can be seen at The Armagh Planetarium until May THE sky always seemed low over our street in Andersonstown, with the Black Mountain looming behind the housing estate, seeming to draw down the sky. And on top of the dark silhouette, the television mast, it’s flashing light a constant presence above my childhood. My friends and I played football in the street constantly. I remember watching my first few live football matches on television and being shocked that they stopped after ninety minutes. Why would you stop But playing in the street on Friday evenings was dficult as it was always especially busy then. At the end of the week the wages were in and everyone arrived in cars and vans and trucks to collect their money. Seamus the bread man in his Barney Hughes van, Tommy the milkman with his terric leather satchel full of loose change slung over his shoulder, and not one insurance man but two, wearing suits and all sweetness and light. Our grocery order would arrive all the way from McAlea’s shop on Divis Street, the Mikado biscuits always lying tantalizingly on top. As many people were going out as coming in, with older brothers and sisters all dressed up, heading downtown for the start of the weekend.So that evening my mates and I took our football down to ‘the Ring’, Koram Ring, a sort of muddy roundabout where our street ended and converged with three other streets. It was a perfect circle of baldy grass, criss-crossed by paths which people used as a shortcuts from street to street.At times, every kid on the street would be there, the McMahon’s, McCann’s, Gilmore’s, Murphy’s, Bannan’s, Allen’s, Casey’s, and me, always me.Not long after we had started playing, the ‘Bovedy’ blazed low across the sky above our heads at that stage a magnicent fireball floodlighting a group of amazed kids. We all stood transfixed, watching it disappear off behind the mountain, having no idea what had just occurred. Back at home, I discovered that no one  had witnessed the event, and over the subsequent days and weeks it was forgotten about. Indeed, recalling the event in much later years, I could find no family member, friend or neighbour who could remember anything of the evening, it was almost asthe subsequent years of violence and political unrest had brutally erased the memory. I almost began to believe that I had created some sort of  memory.But as an visual artist it was too profound an image to be ignored and many years later my research eventually led me to the Armagh Planetarium. Not only did they confirm the event and times and dates, but the actual meteorite which had come to ground on farmland at Bovedy, had been loaned to their collection. I was invited to visit and had the extraordinary privilege of holding the mysterious object which had fireballed across my childhood sky in . Anyone from my generation will recognize the signicance of that year in Northern Ireland, and I have come to regard that event as symbolizing an end to the innocence of my childhood. At that point I had begun to take an interest in art, and had travelled into Belfast with my pocket money, especially to buy my first proper set of paints, from the Educational Supply Store in Fountain Lane. I can imagine that my precious paint box was sitting open on my bedroom windowsill where I kept it and would have been lit up by the passing meteorite. In many ways that image lit the fuse on the work I have produced for this whole project.Having the opportunity to work with the original copy of my old school register, which was completed on that day, has also provided a terric stimulus for the work. Those ink crosses, made by our teacher, registered my ‘presence’ and that of all my friends as the Bovedy crossed the Universe towards us. I captured each tiny mark using microphotography, and then projected them across the surface of the meteorite, photographing the results. These previously insignicant and long forgotten trails of ink were transported and transcribed across fty years of space and time, to create wonderful visual and poetic illuminations.The project provided such a iety of stimulus, that I needed an outcome which could combine image, poetry and sound, and I began experimenting with film and audio recordings. I will be forever grateful to my friend Davy McBride, who was able to work with a class of boys at our old school, now La Salle College, recording them responding to the original class register of th April . That recording became the spine of ‘The Bovedy Illuminations’, the short film I’ve produced for the exhibition.I also wanted a poetic narrative to run throughout the film, at times in two voices, allowing me a dialogue with my fourteen-year-old self. To my amazement I discovered that Nathan Quinn O’Rawe, a current pupil at the school had previously won the prestigious ‘Poetry Aloud’ Award, a national competition to find the best young reader of poetry in Ireland. Throughout the film, Nathan speaks as my younger self. Again I am indebted to Davy for recording us both at the school.Without a doubt, this project would not have come to fruition without the support of Professor David Burton and his colleagues at the Planetarium, and I can’t thank them enough.

In spring , he began flirting with her and using sexual innuendos.Crown prosecutor Neil Connor told Antrim Crown Court, sitting in Belfast, that this flirtation progressed to text messages. McBride initially sent her images of women both in lingerie and naked, with comments such as: \"I like women who dress up.\"Mr Connor said the teenager was \"somewhat flattered\" by the attention and reciprocated with text messages to McBride. These messages - some of which were sent while she was  - included images of her naked.McBride sent the teenager around  naked images of him and they exchanged what the Crown said were \"graphic\" texts.In these messages, McBride told the girl he wanted to have sex with her, and set out what he wanted her to do to him, and what he wanted her to wear. They then met up in July  \"for the purpose of sex\".After she turned , she and McBride began a consensual sexual relationship, and they continued sending naked images to each other.Mr Connor revealed the relationship continued for around five months - until McBride began a sexual relationship with one of her friends.The complainant, now , went to police in June  and McBride was subsequently arrested.He told police he had been in a sexual relationship with the teenager, but said he believed she was .He also branded their relationship \"a bit of extra-marital fun\".Telling the judge there were \"aggravating factors\", Mr Connor spoke of the -year age gap between McBride and the teenager, and the grooming element which saw her sending him images of herself.Defence barrister, Charles MacCreanor QC, said his client was \"shamed and disgusted by what he has done\". Pointing out that McBride came before the court with a clear record, Mr MacCreanor spoke of the impact the offending has had on McBrides domestic situation and also on his business as \"people dont want to associate with him because of the nature of the allegations\".Judge Miller said that after reading a pre-sentence report, he felt McBride had displayed both \"an apparent lack of empathy\" for the complainant, and a \"self-centred attitude.\"The judge also cast doubt on McBrides claims he believed the girl was  when they began having sex, saying it was his belief McBride deliberately targeted someone \"half his age\" for his own \"deviant sexual interests\".As well as being jailed, McBride was also made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for five years."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

the public sector facing a much-needed pay freeze to help bring the public finances under control, many town hall bosses are continuing to pocket huge remuneration packages, with staggering payouts for those leaving their jobs.\"There are talented people in the public sector who are trying to deliver more for less, but the sheer scale of these packages raises serious questions about efficiency

Today we inhabit a shared world, we face the same challenges, and we search for similar solutions.  Let’s continue to do so together.— Leo VaradkarApril , Mr Varadkar added that Ireland will do everything the country can to avoid a hard border.He added: “Last week in Brussels we agreed to give the UK more time to raty the Agreement and when that is done we look forward to securing a partnership with the UK. We want it to be as close as it can possibly be.“I know youwill be there as you always have in the past to help us build a better future.“Irish men and women have helped make America great. Ireland has become a home from home for so many Americans.“We want Ireland to act as a political and economic bridge between the EU and the US. Given our shared language and history, it means the US and the EU can better relate to each other on a political level.”Mr Varadkar added: “Today we are working to preserve all of that which has been achieved in the past and no matter what happens with Brexit, we will do everything we can to prevent theof a hard border.“In this we are backed by countries across the EU and indeed our friends in the United States.“We all want free movement of people North and South and free trade and enterprise, North and South, to continue into the future and forever.”He also said he hoped it would be possible to find a solution for the thousands of undocumented Irish living in the US and those who are in a similar position who come from other countries.“Their welfare continues to be a real concern and priority for us,” he added.“We know the politics of migration is particularly contentious in your country, as it is in so many parts in the world, but we also know the capacity and the power of democracy and politics to bring about great change.”Earlier on Wednesday Ms Pelosi addressed the Irish parliament on the second day of her four day visit to Ireland.Her delegation is set to travel to Northern Ireland on Thursday.Speaking at Dublin Castle, Ms Pelosi said: “We all strive to make the future better for the next generation.“The connection between the United States and Ireland is very precious to us.“We see the Brexit conversation as an aberration and we see a brilliant future ahead working together.”She presented Mr Varadkar with a bespoke bowl printed with doves and added: “It’s all about peace and that is what we are striving for.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish prochoice campaigners on list of worlds most influential people","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She says we must remember women’s right to choose is under threat in a number of countries, and there are million unsafe abortions every year. pic vEVDeCQy— aoe-grace moore.April , Speaking in Dublin on Wednesday, Ailbhe Smyth said the accolade was evidence of the signicant international “ripple” impact of the Together for Yes campaign.“The referendum result here in Ireland was a real boost for the morale of pro-choice campaigners throughout the word and we hope it can be a beacon of light wherever and whenever abortion rights are denied, restricted or under severe threat,” she said.“Where abortion is concerned, Ireland has moved from virtually total prohibition to a relatively pro-choice position – although, it must be acknowledged, that move took all of  hard, bleak years.“Nonetheless, the referendum result marked a resounding defeat for misogyny and extreme right-wing forces.”Grainne Grfin thanked the thousands of volunteer campaigners and organisations across Ireland, whose “dedication, hard work and commitment over months and, in some cases, years, ensured the success of Together for Yes.“This was a movement that really demonstrated the extent to which organised iniduals can shape and influence the world we live in. ”Orla O’Connor said the award was an accumulation of  years of work.“The Eighth Amendment was a cruel and restrictive law and, through the honesty and the lived experience of women and families who suffered, the Irish public listened,” she said.Being included on the #Time list, alongside @ailbhes and @gragrfin is such an honour, and it belongs to everyone in @TogetherYes, particularly to the women and couples who shared their stories to bring about change in Ireland. https:t.co RXBxHzJI— Orla OConnorApril , “The Yes vote in Ireland had an immediate knock-on effect for women in Northern Ireland, who are currently denied the rights women have in Britain and now here in the South.“Activists and campaigners in the North say they are seeing a groundswell of support, especially from young people, since the Repeal referendum.“The NWCI, ARC and all of the many organisations that were involved in Together for Yes will continue to do whatever we can to support them in their struggle.”The issue of the lack of abortion services for women across the world, particularly in Northern Ireland, was noted a number of times during the press conference.Approximately  million unsafe abortions are carried out every year globally, a number that Ailbhe Smyth says is unacceptable.The ARC works closely with Alliance for Choice, an abortion rights campaign group set up in Northern Ireland, which says that  Northern Irish women a week are currently travelling for terminations and face barriers to accessing care, most notably the three-day mandatory waiting period for an abortion.Women from Northern Ireland must also pay  euro   to access abortion services in the Republic of Ireland, howeverthey travel to England, the service is free.The National Women’s Council says that securing abortion rights for Northern Ireland is of the highest priority.Orla O’Connor added: “We’ve formed a new abortion working group, and Alliance for Choice is part of that, the fight for reproductive rights is not over.”The three women also said that their next goal will be forcing the Government to enforce exclusion zones outside healthcare centres to protect women from protesters, a promise which was made by the minister for health last year, but is unlikely to be introduced in .They also wish to see the three-day mandatory waiting period to access termination services removed under the next review of the law.Ireland voted by .% to .% to remove the eighth amendment of the Irish constitution, which outlawed abortion, in May  after a -year campaign, with more than two million votes cast.Other people on Time’s  list include Michelle Obama, Christine Blasey Ford, Nancy Pelosi and Taylor

It’s now going to cost six times what was expected.“The overspend here could run into billions of euros, and to top it all you advise us that the infrastructure would be in the ownership of the consortium but that the state could,  years on, spend more public money to buy that infrastructure back.“It’s utterly ludicrous.”It is a major project, possibly the biggest investment ever in rural Ireland ... it is not going to be done cheaply and its not going to be done quicklyLeo VaradkarMr Varadkar responded: “MinisterRabbitte in  gave an estimate of this project costing up to m euro specically, that was for extending high speed broadband to , villages in Ireland, not from there onwards to every home and business in Ireland.“But we shouldn’t forget what this is about – this programme is about extending high speed broadband to over half a million homes, farms and businesses across the country.“It is a major project, possibly the biggest investment ever in rural Ireland, possibly as important as rural electrication it is not going to be done cheaply and it’s not going to be done quickly.“Bear in mind the amount of investment that has gone into roads in the past  years, bn euros, the amount of investment that has gone into water in the past  years, bn euros.“Building infrastructure like this, connecting homes, farms and businesses all over the country, is going to be expensive.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inquest to be held for love islands sophie gradon","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Incredible, indescribable, I just can’t explain it,” said Nadia Pascassio-Comte, in Strasbourg.“It was beautul and sad at the same time. I had tears in my eyes at one point, and I think that this solidarity is magical, it really unites a lot of people.”At Saint Sulpice church, the second-largest house of worship in Paris, French first lady Brigitte Macron attended a special service for the annual blessing of the oils during Holy Week, ahead of Easter Sunday.Meanwhile, restoration specialists questioned President Emmanuel Macron’s ambitious five-year reconstruction timeline for Notre Dame, with some suggesting it could take more than three times that amount of time.Even prime minister Edouard Philippe acknowledged Wednesday that it would be dficult.“This is obviously an immense challenge, a historic responsibility,” Mr Philippe said after a Cabinet meeting focused on the restoration.Prominent French conservation architect Pierluigi Pericolo told Inrocks magazine the restoration work could take “no less than  years. … It’s a colossal task”.Mr Pericolo, who worked on the restoration of the th-century St Donatien Basilica, which was badly damaged in a  blaze in the French city of Nantes, said it could take two to five years just to check the stability of Notre Dame, which dominates the Paris skyline.“It’s a fundamental step, and very complex, because it’s dficult to send workers into a monument whose vaulted ceilings are swollen with water,” Pericolo told France-Info.“The end of the fire doesn’t mean the edice is totally saved. The stone can deteriorate when it is exposed to high temperatures and change its mineral composition and fracture inside.”Mr Macron received some support for his lofty five-year restoration goal from his presidential cultural heritage envoy, Stephane Bern, who said it was realistic to reopen Notre Dame to the public in time for the Olympic Games in Paris in .However, he did not indicate whether the reconstruction work would be completed by then.Speaking after a meeting at the presidential palace about the monument’s reconstruction, Mr Bern said Mr Macron did not express his views regarding the reconstruction of the roof, or whether the frame should be rebuilt in wood like the destroyed structure, or in metal or concrete.He said also France would hold an international architecture competition to determine whether the destroyed th-century spire would be rebuilt to the same design or a new one.Meanwhile, Notre Dame’s rector said he would close the cathedral for up to “five to six years,” acknowledging that a segment of the structure may be gravely weakened.According to a French government official, the building would have burned to the ground in a “chain-reaction collapse” had firefighters not moved as rapidly as they did to battle the blaze racing through the building.The firefighters acted aggressively to protect wooden supports in the twin medieval bell towers from the flames, averting a bigger catastrophe, said Jose Vaz de Matos, a fire expert with France’s Culture Ministry.“If the fire reached this wooden structure, the bell tower would have been lost,” Mr de Matos said at a news conference. “From the moment we lose the war of the bell towers, we lose the cathedral, because it’s a chain-reaction collapse.”Monday’s fire destroyed most of the lead roof of the -year-old architectural treasure and caused its spire to collapse.An initial fire alert was sounded at .pm, as a Mass was under way in the cathedral, but no fire was found. A second alarm went off at .pm, and the blaze was discovered on the roof.No-one was killed in the fire, after firefighters and church officials speedily evacuated those inside.Firefighters acted as fast as they could to save the cathedral, said senior fire official Philippe Demay, denying that there was any delay in their response.Despite extensive damage, many of the cathedral’s treasures were saved, including Notre Dame’s famous rose windows, although they are not out of danger.Paris Firefighters’ spokesman Lt Col Gabriel Plus said that even though they are in good condition, a “threat” continues to the gables, or support walls, because of the heavy stone statues perched on top of them.“The roof no longer holdsup. They are holding up all by themselves,” he said, adding that some statues must be removed to lessen the weight on the gables.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  An aerial shot of the fire damage to Notre Dame Scaffolding that had been erected for a renovation of the spire and roof must also be properly removed because of its weight and because it is now “crucially deformed”, he added.The Paris prosecutor’s office said investigators have been able to access some parts of the building, although others remain too dangerous.No indication of a criminal act had been found so far, it said.More than  people have already been questioned in the investigation, including workers at the five construction companies who were involved in renovating the church spire and roof. Police also took images of the destruction using drones, in case it is altered by wind or rain.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Firefighters work with a hose Millions of pounds have been pledged for the cathedral’s restoration, coming from ordinary worshippers and wealthy magnates, including those who own L’Oreal, Chanel and Dior.Criticism already has surfaced in France from those who say the money could be better spent where, on smaller, struggling churches or on workers. Others have criticised the billionaires’ donations because their pledges make them eligible for huge deductions in taxes."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wNFxcXC8xNjExMjYwM1xcXC9mb3lsZXNpZGUucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjY0NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjM0MCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvY2FjaGUucmVzaXplZC5jb1xcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiM2FiNTA1ZjFlYmI2MjUxNWRhZjQ1ZTg3MWIyN2RhODFjNmI1ZGU3ZCJ9/foyleside.png","title":"eggstra special fun foyleside easter","story":"This Easter, Foyleside Shopping Centre has something really special planned.

This work will continue over the coming months.Mr McGrady described the option of delivering an all-island solution as ldquological and believes that it would be welcomed.ldquoIt is clear from Mr Pengellyrsquos letter that there isnrsquot the capacity in the South to deliver the all-island service at the moment. Nonetheless, the feasibility of doing so in the future is being examined, he continued.ldquoConfirmation that the use of modern technology to provide answers to parents and avoid a full invasive post mortem is also positive step.Mrs Anne Trainor, who was one of the first people to raise the issue of babies being sent to England for post-mortem, has welcomed Mr Pengellyrsquos letter.The experienced health campaigner, whose daughter Joanne sadly passed away in  aged four-and-a-half as a result of the Tricuspid Atresia heart condition, described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral.She continued: ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le. You will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child.While Mrs Trainor believes there must be a paediatric pathologist who is prepared to provide cover in Northern Ireland, she admits she would also be in favour of an all island service.The contents of the Permanent Secretaryrsquos letter are due to be discussed at tonightrsquos meeting of the Down Community Health Committee int Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn, Downpatrick, at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity group celebrates raising huge sum  ","story":"FRIENDS of the Cancer Centrersquos Newcastle fundraising group is delighted to announce it has raised a phenomenal pound, since it began in .

This bacteria increases the rate of lung decline and puts him at a greater risk to other infections.The hopes of Lorcaacutenrsquos parents crumbled when they heard last week that the house purchase, made possible by Jenrsquos parents, had fallen through due to a legal issue.Then just five days later, the couple learnt that the intensive antibiotic treatment that Lorcaacuten had been receiving over the past three months had failed to treat the bacteria.Jen told the Recorder last night that she and her husband ldquowere at their wits end at the current impasse.ldquoThe medical team are going to try two weeks of a dferent nebulised antibiotic with Lorcaacuten and thenit still there, itrsquos two weeks of IV treatment in hospital, she explained. ldquoThey will try alternative antibiotics and treatment for the next six months. It is such bad timing with the house falling through last week.ldquoWe just think he could be on Orkambi right nowwe were across the border.ldquoItrsquos such a hard thing to talk about to people at the moment about that the treatment not working and hard to explain as Lorcaacuten looks so well.ldquoI havenrsquot been out much since the news and when I went to one of Lorcaacutenrsquos wee groups all I could do is cry.An option for the young couple is to possibly consider is making a permanent move to Louth and sell their Downpatrick home.Lorcaacuten was diagnosed with cystic fibroris at  days old. It is a genetic condition that causes the body to produce thick mucus, which mainly affects the respiratory and digestive system but also affects multiple organs throughout the body.Orkambi is the only drug of its type available to treat the causes and symptoms of CF for children as young as Lorcaacuten.It costs pound, per year to treat a CF patient and parents claim it can add  years on to a CF patientrsquos le expectancy.It was licensed for - year-olds by the European Medicines Agency in Europe in January , and was again licensed for - year-olds in January.While thousands of parents of CF patients throughout the UK believe that it will treat the underlying cause of CF, not just the symptoms, it has not yet been been approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencefor England and Wales.NICE has also failed to reach a purchase agreement with the drugrsquos manufacturer Vertex.The Scottish Medicines Consortium recently introduced Orkambi on a case by case basis for interim access.However, Lorcaacutenrsquos parents are so desperate to get the drug for him that they, along with other CF parents here, have been calling for Stormont to adopt a similiar arrangement.The  year-old mum of two admitted that she had made a desperate call to the Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengellyrsquos office last week and burst into tears talking to his secretary.Mr Pengellyrsquos office sent a letter on April  in reply to the motherrsquos latest enquiry regarding Orkambi for Northern Ireland which stated: lsquoThis is a dficult issue which includes consideration of questions relating to cost and clinical effectiveness and access to commercially confidential information, which adds further complexity. However, I would hope that these discussions will be concluded as soon as practically possible.rsquoThe couple say that they feel that their options are limited, particularly in the absence of a Stormont executive and the ongoing uncertainity regarding Brexit.Jen said: ldquoI blame Brexit as everyone is waiting around to see what happens and I think Stormont would have been up and running againit hadnrsquot been for that.A recent petition to have Orkambi introduced in line with other EC countries has gained more than , signatures to have it debated in parliament.ldquoThe petition getting , signatures last week is the only good news we have had, but the earliest it can happen is June, said Jen.ldquoI would like to thank everyone who as signed the petition as we know that a high percentage of those who did came from Northern Ireland.Jen, in agreement with her husband, has been very vocal in telling Lorcaacutenrsquos story to the media but says itrsquos a position she would rather not have to take.ldquoItrsquos very, very hard to stay positive at the moment and very hard to keep going with Lorcaacutenrsquos treatment when you feel that itrsquos not working.

All our profits go to charity, and we will always let the public know the charity of the month, both on Facebook and at the Cookie Box itself.Hazel continued: ldquoWe ask customers to cover the price of the baking and packaging, and then add a donation.There is a sheet at the front of the box that explains everything.

campaigners in the abortion debate have been included in a list of the world#s most influential people.The former co-directors of Together for Yes have said they are “honoured” to be included on the Time  list, Time magazine’s annual list of the  most influential people in the world.Grainne Grfin, a founding member of the Abortion Rights Campaign , Orla O’Connor, director of the National Women’s Council of Ireland, and Ailbhe Smyth, convener of the Coalition to Repeal the Eighth Amendment, appear on the  list in recognition of their work leading the Together for Yes campaign, leading up to Ireland’s historic referendum last year.Ailbhe Smyth said the accolade was evidence of the signicant international “ripple” impact of the Together for Yes campaign.“The referendum result here in Ireland was a real boost for the morale of pro-choice campaigners throughout the world and we hope it can be a beacon of light wherever and whenever abortion rights are denied, restricted or under severe threat,” she said.“Where abortion is concerned, Ireland has moved from virtually total prohibition to a relatively pro-choice position – although, it must be acknowledged, that move took all of  hard, bleak years.“Nonetheless, the referendum result marked a resounding defeat for misogyny and extreme right-wing forces.”Grainne Grfin thanked the thousands of volunteer campaigners and organisations across Ireland, whose “dedication, hard work and commitment over months and, in some cases, years, ensured the success of Together for Yes.“This was a movement that really demonstrated the extent to which organised iniduals can shape and influence the world we live in. “Orla O’Connor said the award was an accumulation of  years of work.“The Eighth Amendment was a cruel and restrictive law and, through the honesty and the lived experience of women and families who suffered, the Irish public listened,” she said.“The Yes vote in Ireland had an immediate knock-on effect for women in Northern Ireland, who are currently denied the rights women have in Britain and now here in the South.“Activists and campaigners in the North say they are seeing a groundswell of support, especially from young people, since the Repeal referendum.Rat is crushed to death in N.I. restaurant - customers hysterical and standing on chairs Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The NWCI, ARC and all of the many organisations that were involved in Together for Yes will continue to do whatever we can to support them in their struggle.”The issue of the lack of abortion services for women across the world, particularly in Northern Ireland, was noted a number of times during the press conference.Approximately  million unsafe abortions are carried out every year globally, a number that Ailbhe Smyth says is unacceptable.The ARC works closely with Alliance for Choice, an abortion rights campaign group set up in Northern Ireland, which says that  Northern Irish women a week are currently travelling for terminations and face barriers to accessing care, most notably the three-day mandatory waiting period for an abortion.Women from Northern Ireland must also pay €to access abortion services in the Republic of Ireland, howeverthey travel to England, the service is free.The National Women’s Council says that securing abortion rights for Northern Ireland is of the highest priority.Other people on Time’s  list include Michelle Obama, Christine Blasey Ford, Nancy Pelosi and Taylor Swt.try catch  TrendingCookstown  organisers issue statement on Guy MartinOrange Order confirms July  venues for NI woman dies after collision near her

It is a custom which has been maintained for over  years, passed through generations, and will continue to be upheld for many years to come.”Mr Stevenson will be in attendance at the Ballyronan demonstration.The senior Orangeman added: “We continue to welcome an increasing number of international visitors to our celebrations who are keen to experience first-hand the spectacle of the biggest day in the parading calendar. “High calibre music provided by some of the finest marching bands will only add to the festival atmosphere.

Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

They will also be supporting local communities and families as once orders are underway, the product will go into mass production in Welsh factories.Much of the product has been made in a family-run steel fabricators in Ferndale in the Rhondda.John said: ldquoI love the fact that the ZIGZAG has been made within  miles of my home in Penarth. Irsquove visited the factory literally hundreds of times in the last three years and that wouldnrsquot have been possibleit was made in China, but what it proves more than anything is that businessmen and women really need to look thoroughly at whatrsquos under their noses.ldquoIrsquove been amazed by the talent Irsquove seen on these shores - there are some incredible businesses here doing some world beating things, and they need our support. Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development. Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story. Wersquore excited to see where it now goes!Those who pledge their support and buy a ZIGZAG in the first -days of the crowdfunder, which ends on Sunday  May, will benefit from an early bird price of pound.To find out more, visit: igg.me at zigzag-oven article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

action ballot planned for   moy park workers  ","story":"More than , workers in Moy Park are to be balloted for strike action as frustration mounts over pay negotiations.The workers, mostly on the two main sites at Portadown and Dungannon, are to be balloted on whether they wish to take strike action within weeks.Moy Park is one of NI’s largest employers and, according to Unite, the union, there has been serious problems with management during negotiations.Sean McKeever, Unite Regional Officer representing his union’s membership at Moy Park sites, said the union would be balloting over ‘unreasonable management demands in ongoing pay negotiations’.“When Moy Park was sold by Brazilian meat-packing giant JBS SA to one of its own subsidiaries, Pilgrim’s Pride Corp of the USA, Unite the union forecasted that this would presage a broader onslaught on workforce terms and conditions. Sadly the accuracy of that forecast is now apparent to every Moy Park worker in NI.“From our first meetings with the incoming management team it was apparent that they were intent on attacking terms and conditions of workers in the region which remain among the best of any workforce in the UK agri-food industry. In recent pay negotiations they have brought forward proposals seeking to undermine Sht Allowances, Sickness scheme, Holiday entitlement, Attendance allowance, Nomi Statutory days and decent breaks – TCs that were hard won by this workforce over many years and which are simply not up for negotiation.“Moy Park’s workforce in NI has a strong and well-organised team of Unite workplace representatives. We recently defeated an attempt to ide maintenance engineers from the bargaining unit and saw off attempts to keep union officials off-site. Management need to think again – this is not a workforce that will stand by as they slash and burn their way in a race-to-the-bottom on rights and entitlements.“The company’s latest annual pre-tax profits were just short of £ million – an enormous increase of  percent on the year previously. Its current owners Pilgrim’s Pride declared net earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of  million in . These are not businesses that are struggling for survival, the attacks on workers’ pay and conditions are simply part of a drive to maximise profits and increase s for corporate shareholders.“Unite is now preparing the roll-out of a ballot on all-out strike action of our more than three thousand members working for Moy Park in NI. Management need to recognise the determination of this workforce before it leads to unnecessary and entirely avoidable disruption to their operations here”, Mr McKeever said.A Moy Park spokesperson said: “We are aware of the recent union statement and we will continue to engage with the union and work towards a negotiated agreement.”Former rugby chief gets MBE for service to sport Coremetrics

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ub_11.jpg","title":"we need a sea change and this is just the beginning","story":"Posted on Thursday April  by Ulster Business Ulster Business sits down with a host of top femalebusiness leaders at one of Ulster Bank’s DSE dinners to look at the challenges facing women entering the world of business, what change is needed and how far we’ve already come  ‘This is just the beginning’. That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
