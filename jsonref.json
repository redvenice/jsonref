I love the stark nature of the Icelandic landscape and its contrasts. Deltas form from glacial meltwater running down towards the shoreline, picking up silt and different materials along the way to create these ribbon patterns. There’s all sorts of wildlife too – birds, beautiful wild horses, seals.So a few years ago after a lot of research, cross-referencing Google Earth with books and photography by others, I took a red eye from New York to Reykjavik. It was kind of funny to take a jumbo jet, have three hours upon landing to rent a car, check into my hotel and nap for 20 minutes and then turn around to meet a pilot and spend the day up in the air again in his homemade plane.You can do all the research you want for these projects, but nothing compares to actually seeing things in person. Being in an airplane above that landscape was really magical. Emotional, even.At first, when you’re flying around in a tiny plane, opening the door and hanging out to take pictures, it’s a little nerve-wracking. You see your life flash before your eyes. But I’ve become quite comfortable doing it and am able to be extremely focused.We were looking for the birds – they are Arctic tern, or sea swallows. They are small and quite difficult to spot. But we found this flock circling very fast. We were flying above them at a safe distance. I’ve come to realise animals are actually not that intimidated by planes. There have been countless times we have been flying over flamingos or buck, seals, turtles, 100 feet above them – which is really quite low – and they just could not have cared less. .I knew exactly which terrain I wanted to capture the tern flying over: that patterning of white pebbles against the black sand. We circled several times until finally they lined up as perfectly as I could have asked for and I was able to get several shots.I started working in this way in 2009. I had just finished a two-week commercial job in Botswana and had a couple of extra days to kick around the area. Somebody knew a bush pilot who had his own plane and said: “This guy wants something to do.” On a whim, I said, “Sure, that’d be fun.” I had seen the world from 30,000 feet up, but this was completely different – we were in this ultra light aircraft, flying low over a vast mud flat. When it rained, the water would pick up dirt and silt. And when it dried it created really interesting patterns, things I wouldn’t have been able to see if we’d been flying even just a couple of thousand feet higher. It was an incredible experience and set me off on this path.What attracts me to aerial photography is that point, at a certain elevation, where the line between abstraction and reality blurs. I never show the horizon because it’s an obvious giveaway, a point of reference. I want to create an image that works on multiple levels and at multiple distances. Some aerial photography looks like it could be a landscape, or something that you’re seeing under a microscope. I want you to know this was taken from the air.Animals are a good focal point. They’re recognisable, although I’m often showing them from a point of view people aren’t familiar with. Here, it’s a bit like a layer cake, you have the flat earth, the birds flying above it, and you’re above it all. I like playing with the way the lens flattens this multi-level, three-dimensional space – the sense of scale, the textures, the distance.The fact that I’m moving through the same space as the birds is one part of the story that the image doesn’t tell,. But it is important for me. Everything is at play, the movement of the ocean, the implied movement of the birds. There’s a connectedness between the living and the moving, to make a beautiful, harmonious image.Training: Photojournalism at the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse University.Influences: Jackson Pollock and Joan Miró.High point: “The shoot I did in South Africa in 2016: we covered about 2000 miles of ground, 45 hours of flying, in a week, never knowing where we would eat that day or sleep that night, landing on remote airstrips, following wildlife from tips from people we would meet along the way. It was a real adventure.”Low point: “Any time I’m not working.”Top tip: “Work your ass off. To be successful you have to put in a tremendous amount of hard work and not give up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb05c5d0b02056558d5a675055c0770e64e894df/0_189_4961_2977/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=203688fc87108fb59123acbf00fdd9fe","title":"stirling prize 2019 riba shortlist cork building social housing","story":"Energy efficiency is a priority this year as a railway station, visitor centre, social housing project and opera house vie for the RIBA award for British building of the year A house made of cork will go up against a whisky distillery and one of the busiest stations in the UK to be named building of the year in the most interesting and varied Stirling prize shortlist for some time. They are joined on the list, which celebrates innovation in British architecture, by a new visitor centre for the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, an opera house inserted into a 17th-century stable block in Leicestershire and an exemplary development of low-energy council housing in Norwich.Energy efficiency rightfully looms large on this years’s list, following the recent launch of Architects Declare, a call to arms from a large group of previous Stirling prize winners for an urgent “paradigm shift” to ditch carbon-hungry practices. The Cork House in Berkshire, designed by Matthew Barnett Howland with Dido Milne and Oliver Wilton, offers one such alternative. Built from expanded cork blocks, made using waste from the cork stopper industry, the structure is carbon negative and will emit next to zero carbon over its life it is also designed for disassembly and reuse. The exposed cork walls and engineered timber create a cosy interior space that feels burrowed from the ground, lit from above by a row of funnel-shaped roof lights. It was described by RIBA judges as “a noble, momentous model to aspire to”, and its innovations could be scaled up.The house has a raw material beauty shared by the Weston, an earthy jewel of a visitor centre for the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, designed by the young practice Feilden Fowles. Presenting a rugged monolithic wall that looks as if it was sliced out of the soil, the defensive enclosure houses an expansive light-washed building, hosting a new gallery, restaurant and shop in a carefully judged sequence of spaces. A long, slightly inward-curving glass wall frames a stunning view of the park from the cafe, while the gallery is topped with board-marked concrete roof lights that plunge down from the ceiling. Once again, there is clever environmental innovation: temperature and humidity are regulated by a hidden labyrinth of 10,000 unfired bricks, avoiding the need for air conditioning while still allowing the gallery to display precious loans.The Weston’s quiet restrain is shared by the Nevill Holt Opera, a project that offers further proof of Witherford Watson Mann’s talent for inserting new things inside old shells, following their Stirling prize win for the transformation of the ruined Astley Castle into a Landmark Trust house in 2013. This time they have applied their meticulous skills to a former stable block in the grounds of Nevill Holt Hall near Market Harborough in Leicestershire, erecting an elegant 400-seat venue that preserves the rough-and-ready exterior quality of the space. A horseshoe-shaped balcony is raised on slender steel columns above a rugged concrete floor, while douglas fir panelling creates a sense of continuity between stage and seats. “The modesty, craftsmanship, care and attention that have been applied here are exceptional,” said the judges.A more high-octane kind of drama can be found further north, in the form of Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners’ billowing distillery and visitor experience for the Macallan whisky empire in Moray, on the northern coast of Scotland. The undisputed masters of exposed pipes have conjured a theatrical spectacle from the seething network of tubes, mash tuns, condensers and copper stills that go into making the amber liquor. With their usual hi-tech precision, the architects have transformed the prosaic production process into a series of set-piece stage sets with the glamour of scenes that Ken Adam might have dreamed up for James Bond or Dr Strangelove. It is all swept beneath a roof of grassy mounds that looks like the Teletubbies went hard on the scotch. It is an appropriately outre temple for a brand that produced the world’s most expensive bottle of whisky, which sold last year for £848,000.While RSH+P have made an elaborate spectacle out of the simple process of distilling grain, Grimshaw architects have succeeded in unravelling the fiendishly complex knot of London Bridge station into something remarkably clear and straightforward. By scooping out the underbelly of Victorian railway vaults, they have created an airy open concourse, where the tracks bridge the space overhead, allowing natural light to flood down in between them. It is a refreshingly legible space, with pairs of long escalators rising to the platforms, while a new arcade of concrete vaults leads through to the Underground station. From the outside it is less successful, resorting to a weird kind of flattened Victorian pastiche, topped with the practice’s trademark swoopy metal canopies, but with edges and junctions that don’t quite glide as gracefully as they should.In its 23-year history, the Stirling prize has never been awarded to social housing – in part, because there hasn’t been any to celebrate. But now, as local authorities across the country are busy building their own homes again for the first time in a generation, there couldn’t be a better time to recognise the value of thoughtful design for those that need it most, and the bravery of councils that are leading the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a84b6e600558971e4877f84b7f42a0908747bfe9/0_98_2339_1403/master/2339.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e832cfdf8258753ea957c88c39e918d3","title":"michael gove man in hurry owen bennett review","story":"This skilful, if flawed, biography revealed that Gove took cocaine. Can the Tory party’s ‘best rhetorician’ come back yet again? “Political biographers who choose to write about a figure not yet at the end of their career are taking a gamble,” Owen Bennett writes in his biography of Michael Gove. He is talking not about himself but about Gove’s own entry in the genre, Portillo: The Future of the Right. Weeks after Gove’s study of Michael Portillo hit bookshelves, the Enfield Southgate MP’s putative leadership bid had hit the buffers.Bennett’s A Man in a Hurry has suffered a similar fate. And unlike The Future of the Right, which was criticised (both at the time and by Bennett) for pulling its punches, this book arguably played a decisive role in the downfall of its subject. It is in these pages that Bennett revealed that Gove took cocaine while working at the Times, a story which, given the wafer-thin margin that separated him from Jeremy Hunt in the vote of MPs, may well have brought his leadership bid to an early end.It is by no means guaranteed that Gove will even be kept in the cabinet if and when Boris Johnson takes office. Even if he is, he looks, at present, to be a politician on the downward slope. He has enjoyed, as Bennett details, not one but two political resurrections already: once when David Cameron restored him to full cabinet rank after electoral triumph in 2015, once after Theresa May brought him back from the wilderness after electoral disaster in 2017. While you would have to be foolish to rule out a third return, the chances are that this book is a work of historical interest rather than a vital explainer of the man of the moment. How does it fare?One of the many difficulties of writing a biography of Gove is that anyone who begins the task is, at once, writing about the right’s most readable polemicist and the Conservative party’s best rhetorician of the last 20 years. It’s a nerve-racking job for any writer, but Bennett handles it well. The book rattles along nicely as it recounts Gove’s early life, school days and career before politics. It frustrates when, as with any historical work, the author’s conclusions seem arguable. I’m not convinced by Bennett’s views on Gove’s family, for instance. The book points out that he resisted finding out about his biological mother in deference to the woman who raised him. Bennett thinks there’s a contradiction between this and statements by Gove’s adoptive mother that she would support him should he wish to meet his biological mother. But it’s in the nature of loving parents to be self-sacrificing, and in the nature of considerate sons to try to avoid causing them pain. If he is overly suspicious about Gove’s family, Bennett is far too generous about his career in student politics I know of no candidate to the Oxford Union who managed to reach the presidency “without resorting to dark tactics” as Bennett claims Gove did.Nor I am I convinced by Bennett’s audit of Gove’s time as education secretary: he focuses on the vast increase in the number of academies and free schools that opened under him. That Gove carried out his reforms is not in question. What is in question is whether the difference between his academies and those of Tony Blair required him to make an enemy of the teaching profession, a decision that has dogged his career ever since. Of course, the measures that he and his staff took to restrict the circle of trust and information in the department make it harder to make the pro-Gove case and may well mean that future historians conclude that he was simply an irredeemable bomb-thrower.Sometimes the biographical focus can throw the reader off. Bennett fillets the contents of A Stab in the Dark, the shortlived late-night Channel 4 satire that Gove presented with David Baddiel and Tracey MacLeod. That the book presents us with the most outrageous and close-to-the-bone remarks – such as Gove asking one homophobic guest if the practice of anal sex isn’t simply an example of “man using his intelligence and adaptability” – means that the reader spends much of the relevant chapter under the impression that Gove was a comic genius and the series a forgotten gem. It comes as a shock when Bennett informs us that most of the show was dire and that it flopped. (Gove himself is quoted as describing the programme as a “turkey”.)But these are the quibbles that shouldn’t detract from a highly skilful bringing together of diaries, contemporary accounts and the author’s own research. The story ends with Gove launching his campaign – a campaign derailed mostly because Conservative members wanted the loudest and most uncompromising Brexiter in the field.As a result, this is a good book that feels somewhat pointless: though we shouldn’t forget that we’d have said the same thing had Bennett published a biography of Boris Johnson in the summer of 2016.• Michael Gove: A Man in a Hurry is published by Biteback (£20).

In a boat they had built themselves over three years of snatched evenings and stolen weekends, they set sail from Cape Town and bobbed up the Atlantic. Using paper maps and taking only short breaks at Ascension Island and the Azores, they headed north until, at 3am on 17 September, they Scherzo arrived in the mudflats of the Thames. They spent that winter basking not in the azure warmth of South Africa but 8,000 miles away at St Katharine Docks, where the waters froze around their boat and ducks trotted on ice past their cabin. Yet they stayed.Growing up, Crampton knew the Thames estuary was “the place I loved best”. Taken aboard the family boat at six weeks old, she went on to spend holidays travelling the North Sea and give directions not by road name, but by compass point (“Walk north-north-east from the station and turn west at the war memorial”). Even as a rebellious teenager doing the teenage thing of spurning all that her parents had given her, the Thames kept calling her back. When a student at Oxford, she “walked hundreds of miles up and down its banks, shivering in icy frosts and sweating in muggy dampness”.Few stretches of water have been as hymned by the poets. In 1802, William Wordsworth composed a sonnet on Westminster Bridge that opens “Earth has not any thing to show more fair” and carries on oohing and aahing for the next 13 lines. This while the Thames was an open sewer in which, as scientist Michael Faraday later wrote, “the feculence rolled up in clouds so dense that they were visible at the surface”.No such soft-focus sentimentalising for Crampton, whose book expresses a more precise love. Where other writers argue the Thames made London, she looks at how men and women have made the river. As she travels through this book from source to sea, covering much of the Thames’s 215 miles by boat, the “ancient, dreaming quality” of its upper reaches barely distracts her from Victorian pumping stations, cranes and containers, shipwrecks. Mercifully little time is spent on pretty Oxfordshire with its prosecco and punting, while William Morris lamenting the river’s “cockney-isation” is waved aside as a nostalgia-monger.More than water flows along the Thames for centuries, so has cash. In his poem “London”, William Blake wanders “thro’ each charter’d street,  Near where the charter’d Thames does flow” because the chartered companies have vied up the river. St Katharine Docks, where Crampton’s parents spent their first British winter, was one of several built in the early 19th century to take in goods and people. That productive energy coursed through the Thames’s tributaries too, with manufacturers, agriculturalists and distributors setting up on their banks. London’s past as an industrial hub has been shamefully painted out, yet it shaped large parts of the city, such as the outer London suburb in which I was born and brought up, Edmonton, on the River Lea.The heavier the use of the river, the bigger the problems to be displaced. Surplus people and sewage – over the centuries both were shipped downriver to rot. Victorian parish authorities dumped their waste on the marshlands of Kent Cockneys migrated to Essex. Crampton remembers how in the early 90s the river ran yellow and brown today it can be as blue as the Mediterranean. Noticeable these days are not ships carrying coal from Newcastle but apartments offering river views to multinational investors who will never enjoy them. It’s a wonder that the Wordsworth sonnet hasn’t been deployed by estate agents.The money that used to flow along the Thames collects in ever fewer hands, and the main residue of the river’s industrial history is the condescension heaped on those who remind us of it. Tilbury, sniffed the Economist in 2014, is “a polyp of hard-up, mostly white, grumpy people”.Crampton’s sympathies are firmly with the polyp, although they are occasionally ill expressed. She praises Barking’s Labour MP Margaret Hodge for telling legal migrants “you’ve got to earn your rights” before qualifying for social housing, then a few pages later condemns Theresa May for her shocking treatment of Windrush-generation immigrants as lower-status Brits. The connection between the two may strike more than a few readers as glaringly obvious.In a book about how people live around the Thames, Crampton is intriguingly light on her own biography. Early on, she mentions how at 17 she was diagnosed with a blood cancer, and fitted A-level essays in with sessions of chemo. Just a few weeks after starting at Oxford, the illness came back. “When I struggled with the limitations my health placed on me, or felt weighed down by the need to pretend to those around me that everything was fine, the vitality of the river could cure me.” Then she bustles on to a brief history of the sealing of the Magna Carta at Runnymede, a subject to which she devotes more pages.In these days of publishers treating almost any non-fiction subject as an excuse for authorial memoir, such reticence is at first disarming. Yet this is also a personal book, as when Crampton moves on from discussing the smell of the estuary to a memory of how one hospital cancer unit “had such a powerful odour of saline, plastic, strong tea and gentle concern”. The further the author journeys down the river the more she lets her winning idiosyncrasies show, and the greater the reading pleasure. The result is a tender yet argumentative book dressed in a beautiful jacket that someone will panic-buy at Christmas for an in-law who will crack it open expecting fond cliches about The Wind in the Willows only to alight on an ode to mud, in all its varieties “from the silky ochre liquid that holds rills and ripples like frozen water to the gleaming, thick, caramel-brown texture exposed on the shore at low tide”.And what’s not to like about that?• The Way to the Sea is published by Granta (£16.99).

They are talking about a much harder version which would cause much more disruption to our economy and the OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no deal the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no-deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now.”The OBR estimated that the recession – caused by the impact of increased uncertainty and falling confidence on investment and trade – would be as bad as that suffered in the 1990s but only a third as bad as the slump at the time of the financial crisis of the late 2000s.However, the OBR – established in 2010 to provide independent forecasts for growth and the public finances – said the outcome would be worse if a no-deal, no-transition Brexit also resulted in chaos at the border.The Office for Budget Responsibility is the government’s independent forecaster, which gives its verdict on the outlook for growth and the public finances twice a year.The forecasts are published to coincide with the chancellor’s two big set pieces of the year – the autumn budget and the spring statement – and takes into account the impact of any tax and spending measures announced in those statements.It was established in 2010 by the then chancellor George Osborne with the aim of improving the credibility of the government’s official forecasts for growth. The forecasts were previously produced by the Treasury itself and often criticised for being unrealistic.The OBR is led by three members of the budget responsibility committee, including chairman Robert Chote, a former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, with support from the OBR’s permanent staff of 27 civil servants.“A more disruptive or disorderly scenario could hit the public finances much harder,” the OBR added.Speaking at a press conference to launch the report, the OBR chairman, Robert Chote, said: “The big picture is that heightened uncertainty and declining confidence deter investment, higher trade barriers with the EU weigh on domestic and foreign demand, while the pound and other asset prices fall sharply.“These factors combine to push the economy into recession.”Until now the OBR had been assuming there would be a smooth Brexit when coming up with its forecasts but it said the willingness of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt to contemplate a no-deal departure meant it was stress-testing alternative scenarios.Chote also warned Johnson and Hunt that the spending pledges made during their campaigns to be prime minister came at a cost. He said the two contenders to replace Theresa May had made a series of uncosted proposals for tax cuts and spending increases that would be likely to raise government borrowing by tens of billions of pounds. “There is no war chest that would make them a free lunch,” he said.Nicky Morgan, the chair of the House of Commons Treasury committee, has written to the Treasury and the Bank of England asking for updated analysis of Brexit under different scenarios. “This will ensure that parliament is as informed as possible as it considers key decisions about the future of our country,” she said.John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, said: “It’s obvious the Conservative party constitutes a clear and present danger to the economy and the wellbeing of everyone in the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aead7807ce49da5ea478346b962e4b74a0b2d07a/13_11_2620_1573/master/2620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cf3562a91d224b72153d109ce512a5b","title":"slug lettuce owner stonegate agrees 3bn deal to buy pub chain eneterprise inns","story":"Takeover of UK’s biggest pub chain likely to prompt interest of competition watchdogThe private equity-owned company behind the Slug \u0026amp Lettuce chain of bars has agreed a £3bn deal to buy Enterprise Inns (Ei), which owns the UK’s largest network of pubs.The takeover would add Ei’s nationwide stable of more than 4,000 pubs to Stonegate’s existing 772 sites, which also include Yates and Walkabout, making the combined group Britain’s largest pub company by far.However, both sides have agreed that terms may have to be altered if the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) requires them to offload more than 100 pubs to allay concerns about the impact on choice for drinkers.The proposed buyout comes as the hospitality industry battles increased costs because of the minimum wage increase, higher property prices and electricity bills as well as a diminishing appetite among younger customers for pub drinking.Stonegate is backed by the private equity group TDR Capital, which agreed last month to buy the Webuyanycar owner, BCA, in a deal worth £1.9bn.Ei traces its roots back to 1991 and has become Britain’s largest pub owner through a string of acquisitions, including buying former Whitbread pubs. It employs more than 1,800 people.It has recently been shifting strategy away from tenanted pubs, where it owns the premises and rents to an independent publican, towards a managed model, where its own employees take charge.Stonegate’s 772 pubs and bars are entirely managed.The tenanted business model has come under increasing pressure recently amid anger at the difficulty some publicans have faced when they try to cut the “beer tie”, the centuries-old arrangement under which they buy beer from the pubco that owns their premises.The Pubs Code Adjudicator announced an investigation into Ei’s rival Star Pubs and Bars, owned by Heineken, over its behaviour towards tenants, warning that other pub companies could also face inquiries in the near future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10c311bb3e26eab86c94e02aa1dd8d6d52928a29/0_227_5410_3247/master/5410.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67166374281320e0a5509d735969f102","title":"vanished neighbourhoods the areas lost to urban renewal","story":"Some of the world’s most fascinating neighbourhoods from Chicago to Shanghai have been razed by regeneration – and it’s not just the buildings that goThe wave of urban renewal that swept the world in the 20th century gave us inner-city highways, modernist downtown malls and high-rise housing projects. It destroyed countless fine-grained, human-scaled neighbourhoods.We lost more than just physical buildings. Each of these communities contained something less tangible – neighbourhoods like these are ecosystems. They incubate communities and cultures that do not and could not exist elsewhere.Sometimes, as in these 10 that follow, a neighbourhood lives in the memory of the displaced and their descendants, as powerful in death as in life.In 1914, the author Gustav Meyrink wrote a vivid depiction of 16th-century life in Prague’s Jewish quarter, Josefov. His novel Der Golem describes an oppressive labyrinth of ancient, looming houses in which “something malicious seemed to permeate the very bricks”.That was pretty close to the perspective of Prague’s city government at the end of the 19th century. By then, Josefov’s medieval streets had become a dense, erse hub of poor Czechs, immigrants and artisans whose trades had been devastated by factory manufacturing. City authorities, inspired by Georges-Eugène, Baron Haussmann’s recent “renovation” of Paris, saw it as a blight. In December 1896, the Finis Ghetto urban-renewal scheme kicked off with a literal bang, as 45 houses were destroyed by dynamite. With the exception of few religious sites, the entire neighbourhood was destroyed.The razing faced little opposition from Prague’s Jewish residents, many of whom returned after redevelopment – fuelling resentment among the displaced, and contributing to the antisemitic atmosphere that prevailed in the years before the first world war.A neighbourhood within a building, Mecca Flats was built for Chicago’s 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition and by 1910 was home to artists, musicians, white-collar workers and labourers, mostly black, many arrivals in the great migration. The building was one of America’s first luxury apartment houses, oriented around a central atrium that brought the street life of the neighbourhood indoors.By the great depression, it housed more than 1,000 people. The poet Gwendolyn Brooks worked in the building as a peddler in the 1930s, and immortalised it in her 1968 epic poem, In the Mecca, conceiving of it as a cross-section of black American life: “To touch every note in the life of this block-long block-wide building, would be to capsulize the gist of black humanity in general.”The Mecca was acquired by the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1941 tenants, activists and preservationists rallied to save it, but it was replaced with the school’s Crown Hall – a bright slice of modernism, designed in direct opposition to the perceived darkness and decrepitude of the Mecca.St John’s Ward was an aberration in uptight, homogenous 20th-century Toronto. A erse polyglot with a population density approaching that of contemporary central Hong Kong, it was a prototypical arrival city, with Irish, Italian, Jewish, African, Chinese and others establishing their first Canadian beachheads. A 1922 dispatch in the city’s Globe newspaper reported: “Chinese restaurants are filled with negro customers, many of them women, while here and there an occasional white girl can be seen partaking of a meal with either a brown or yellow skinned partner.” Sanitation and overcrowding were the ostensible targets of the reformers who sought to eradicate the Ward, but that nascent multiculturalism was probably as much a target.Redevelopment began in 1946 and continued for decades today, the district is an imposing institutional corridor separating the city’s downtown from the fine-grained neighbourhoods to the west – a few of which, especially Kensington Market and Chinatown, still bear traces of the old Ward.Born in Alabama, Coleman Young’s family moved to Detroit’s Black Bottom in 1923. The future mayor found himself at five years old amid a community of Jewish, Greek, Italian and Irish residents – and a burgeoning black population arriving, as his family did, from the south. (Boxers Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson, both southerners by birth, lived a few doors from one another here in the 1930s.)Young was politicised as a teenager, listening to union workers talk leftist politics in a local barbershop. He found entertainment along the neighbourhood’s commercial spine, Hastings Street, where John Lee Hooker, Della Reese and others found their musical footing in small clubs.As with other renewal projects nationally, the funds to raze the community were in part provided by the federal Housing Act of 1949, which extended broad powers of expropriation to cities. By 1956 much of Hastings Street had been destroyed and replaced by the Chrysler Freeway. Bisected, what remained of the community quickly fell into decline.Late in life, Young would remember the neighbourhood as “a thrilling convergence of people, a wonderfully versatile and self-contained society”.Philip Payton Jr is sometimes referred to as the “father of Harlem” for his work buying properties in Upper Manhattan and renting them to black tenants. In 1905, he began to do the same on West 99th and 98th streets, purchasing several blocks of buildings between Central Park West and Amsterdam Avenue.A Harlem-in-miniature took root here, and half a decade later, it was a tight-knit community that included the composer Will Marion Cook, opera singer Abbie Mitchell, activist James Weldon Johnson, historian Arturo Schomburg and singer Billie Holiday. In 1951, empowered as Detroit was by 1949’s Housing Act, the city declared the district a slum and evicted residents. More than 500 buildings were demolished, replaced by a luxury housing project called Park West Village.The community became one of the lesser known victims of US slum clearance, though no less mourned by its former residents. “There’s a space in my life that’s missing right now because of that move,” former resident Jim Torain told a documentary film crew in 2008.In 1844, Los Angeles councilman and rancher Julian Chavez petitioned for 83 acres (33.5 hectares) of land in what was than a semi-rural district near today’s Echo Park. He got it, and over the following decades three neighbourhood, Palo Verde, La Loma and Bishop, developed in the verdant hills north of the city. The mostly Mexican-American residents practised subsistence agriculture and raised livestock, ran their own schools, and lived a semi-agrarian lifestyle – in the shadow of one of the nation’s ascendant boomtowns.By the 1940s, urban renewal made the community a target for redevelopment. Residents’ homes were expropriated, and while they were promised relocation to new public housing, those plans fell apart after Norris Poulson, who believed public housing to be a communist plot, won 1953’s Los Angeles mayoral race.A handful of stragglers waged the years-long Battle of Chavez Ravine against city authorities, but by 1959 the community was destroyed. In 1962, Dodger Stadium was erected on the site.Sophiatown was the Victorian-era brainchild of a real estate investor who in 1897 bought 237 acres of land near Johannesburg, laid out a few tidy streets, and named them after his children and wife. After the city located a sewage disposal plant nearby, his white homebuyers fled, and black residents found an opportunity denied them elsewhere: property ownership.By the 1950s, Sophiatown was the “Chicago of South Africa”, filled with shebeens (speakeasies), incubating musicians and artists. It was a focal point of activity for the African National Congress and a young Nelson Mandela, and a hub of anti-apartheid activism. In Sophiatown Speaks, the poet and former resident Don Mattera declared: “Sophiatown was the antithesis of what they wanted for this country. Sophiatown had the black people – meaning Coloured, Indians, Blacks of all tribes – and the whites living together.”In 1955, its residents were mostly relocated to the township of Soweto, out of the city. The community was bulldozed, reconstructed as a district of tidy bungalows, and renamed, in Afrikaans, Triomf, eventually reverting in 2006 to its original name.The de facto capital of Canada’s eastern provinces, Halifax is proof that urban renewal often exacted as great a toll on small cities as on large ones. In 1969, local planners were aiming to replicate the slum clearance policies of bigger metropolises, and devised a scheme to raze the city’s historic waterfront for an expressway to the suburbs.Protests halted the expressway, but not a massive downtown interchange that wiped out almost 15 blocks and 400 buildings in the city centre. It displaced thousands of mostly poor residents, and severed the city’s working-class North End from its downtown, exacerbating its decline. Many of the displaced were African-Nova Scotian, descendants of some of Canada’s oldest black communities. (The displacement came just a few years after the destruction of Africville, a historic black community at the city’s northern tip.)The interchange was considered a blight almost as soon as it was erected, and will soon be torn down itself, to be replaced by a mixed-use neighbourhood.In the 1950s, a group of itinerant puppeteers settled on the outskirts of Delhi, establishing this vital community of performers. Memorably described in Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children, its thousands of small homes, called jhuggis, were crammed daily with magic shows, music, storytelling, puppetry and performance.But like similar communities, Kathputli lacked sanitation and other amenities by the 2000s, it was targeted by the Delhi Development Authority, which planned an “in-situ rehabilitation” programme. This involved moving residents to a “transit camp”, razing the neighbourhood, and developing a new high-rise district. Nearly 3,000 350-square-foot apartments were to house former residents, with the rest of the land given to market-rate development.Few residents willingly moved, arguing that the community’s survival depended – like Seoul’s Euljiro district – on the irreplaceable particulars of its built environment. The tension came to a head in October 2017 when demolition began, leaving residents fleeing their homes with little notice. Some residents remained, living in the ruins.A visitor to Shanghai in the late 19th century would have found the city dominated by narrow, winding lanes of shikumen, the local equivalent of Britain’s Victorian terraced workers’ housing, or Philadelphia’s miles of rowhouse neighbourhoods. Laoximen is among the most famous of these neighbourhoods, the product of an earlier population boom that saw the city swell with rural residents coming to the fast-growing city, a hub of regional trade.Today, as the city struggles to house its 26.3 million residents, many old neighbourhoods are being targeted. Part of Laoximen has been destroyed, and demolition is imminent for what remains. Shanghai has a better reputation for preservation than many Chinese cities, however, and a few buildings in Laoximen may be retained.“It still breaks your heart every time you see something like Laoximen,” Tina Kanagaratnam of advocacy group Historic Shanghai told the South China Morning Post last year. “You know this whole way of life is not going to continue. But every time we go somewhere else in China and come back, we think, ‘Oh thank God we live in Shanghai’, because there is so much more of this than there is anywhere else.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75e2e4e0711bdecd4a6be9e7e3fb3991e05ca6f7/38_0_3427_2057/master/3427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=682e167d0ac863c97af7097b1cae756f","title":"african uk visa rejections home office global britain","story":"The Home Office’s hostile handling of visiting African professionals doesn’t bode well for Global BritainAn African passport is the most egalitarian of documents, in that if you have one then class, employment status and professional invitations from the country you are visiting all count for nothing. From university professors to unskilled labourers, anyone holding a passport issued by a country in Africa will be treated the same by UK border officers. They will also show no compassion for or recognition of the need for people to be reunited with family or to see friends.In fact it’s not too far-fetched to say an African passport is a no-travel document. Even countries within Africa are miserly with each other. I am a veteran visa applicant, and I can tell you there is no respite. A European visa is as prohibitively hard to secure as one to a neighbouring African country. My Sudanese passport meant that I had to become an Olympian visa-applier in order to visit, study and settle in the UK. You can’t slouch with a passport from a country on a terror watchlist.I can trace the entrenchment of the Home Office’s hostile environment over the past two decades or so via the different processes of applying for almost every UK visa possible – student, extension-of-student, family, holiday. I have known them all. I have measured out my life in visa rejections and appeals. I have applied for visas that don’t even exist any more. In my experience the policy known as the hostile environment has not only been punitive towards immigrants, but also towards visitors – who, for the most part, are on professional or business trips, or holidays. I like to keep a sense of humour about the wording of rejections. An application by my mother to come to visit me in London was refused on the basis that there was insufficient evidence of our relationship, and therefore no guarantee that she would return to her home country. I quipped: “I will append print-outs of our WhatsApp conversations next time, reams of screenshots of her messaging at ungodly hours saying, ‘Are you still up?’” But the visa officer was less than amused.A parliamentary inquiry this year presented evidence that African applicants are twice as likely to be refused non-immigrant visas as those from other continents. MPs demanded an investigation. The findings of that investigation were published this week, and they are damning. The UK visa system was pronounced “not fit for purpose” as it was “inaccessible to many Africans”. Chi Onwurah, the Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central, said that: “At a time when the UK needs to be ‘open for business’, the broken visas system is doing severe damage to UK-Africa relations across a variety of sectors. As well as our relations, it damages our economy and society. It is embarrassing, patronising and insulting to African applicants and leaves the slogan of ‘Global Britain’ empty and meaningless.”Academics in particular suffer. Among those turned down for visas were people awarded funded positions, and even researchers invited to African-themed summits and conferences. In May, the London School of Economics held a training workshop for African attendees to its Africa summit. One attendee out of 25 signed up for the event all the rest had been refused visas. In April, Ebola researchers from Sierra Leone were blocked from attending vital training in the UK, funded by the Wellcome Trust as part of a £1.5m pandemic-preparedness programme.The grounds for rejecting visa applications (and the wording) are often arbitrary and demeaning. One of the Ebola researchers received a letter saying that “on the balance of probabilities we don’t believe you are a researcher”. One of the most commonly cited reasons for rejections is that applicants will simply not return to their home countries in Africa, choosing instead to leave their careers in academia, friends and family behind, skip their visa and then spend a lifetime working illegally in the UK in poorly paid cash-in-hand jobs.The implication (although the messaging is hardly subtle) is that life in Africa, whatever your circumstances, is one to be fled. If the cost of that is the racial profiling and exclusion of an entire cohort of African professionals and academics, which damages the research networks and indeed credibility of “Global Britain”, then so be it.Expect more of this, after Brexit, as the UK’s visa system becomes more crudely oriented towards cap-in-hand facilitation for those with means, rather than those who will enhance the country’s science, culture and innovation. There will be more expensive “entrepreneur” visas for wealthy Europeans and those from the Middle East who only summer in London and leave their vast properties uninhabited the rest of the year. More long-term visit visas will be granted to those whose only benefit to the UK is paying for hotel rooms, restaurants and luxury shopping.The Home Office’s hostile environment is not only a racial profiler, it is a financial one, too. There is little appreciation of what an African researcher or visiting academic can do to benefit the UK. Show us you’re here to rent a suite at the Dorchester for a month, or sling your hook.As businesses prepare to leave the UK after Brexit, so too are the country’s organisations, thinktanks and academic conferences. The LSE will be holding its next Africa summit not in London but in Belgium due to the ease of securing visas for Africans there, and because so many African invitees now refuse to go through the humiliating British visa application process. It is yet another way in which the UK self-harms. A hard lesson will be learned soon enough after Brexit. Whether it is for trade, academia or just a holiday, other countries are available."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27ae9f0a8f48624395d84698134fb6c635356c98/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41e291908e5f96e73ff209944761d489","title":"i was sniffy about cruise ships adrian chiles","story":"On a visit aboard the Queen Mary 2, I learned it’s not all ballrooms and bow ties. I even befriended a couple from my neck of the woodsI’ve been in Liverpool this week, filming for Coast on BBC Two. The Queen Mary 2 had moored up at Cunard’s original home en route to Iceland and North America. I have long been sniffy about cruise ships, opining that I couldn’t think of anything worse than being cooped up with a load of old people in bow ties.But it turns out it’s not quite like that. Yes, the opulence and sheer scale of the ballroom and dining rooms and so on is somewhat preposterous. And the shops – or “retail spaces”, as the ship’s manager insisted on calling them – are absurdly upmarket, like a floating Bond Street. I mean, who drops thousands on a cruise only to drop thousands more on a watch or a handbag?That said, it is all decidedly unstuffy, and many slices of human life are there to be cherished. I spoke to Marilyn, a retired school librarian from Wirral, whose dad first sailed out of Liverpool as a steward’s boy on merchant ships running the gauntlet in the second world war’s Atlantic convoys. She showed me his little logbook of voyages, including one in 1959 to Canada from Liverpool via Reykjavik, which is exactly where she is heading now.In a hot tub at the stern, I came across a Bulgarian New Yorker ex-ice hockey player who had fled west in 1960 as a political refugee from Todor Zhivkov’s regime.And best of all for me was a retired couple from Rowley Regis in the West Midlands, Maureen and Chris. My producer asked if we could film them in their cabin. Chris, a huge, solidly built bloke, had a think about it and, deadpan as a Black Country canal, said: “Would you be filming before, during or after we make love?” I nearly choked on my cucumber sandwich.Down on Liverpool’s Pier Head there is a statue of the Beatles. Tourists gather respectfully before it, taking pictures of each other turning the fab four into five, eight, 12, whatever. There was something odd about the statue I couldn’t quite put my finger on at first, but then it struck me: the four figures actually look exactly like John, Paul, George and Ringo. Given the controversies over “likenesses” of everyone from Cristiano Ronaldo to Victoria Wood, I’d suggest the bloke who knocked this one up, Andy Edwards, becomes the go-to man for all such tributes henceforth.• Adrian Chiles is a  columnist, broadcaster and writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4c904a31b9f12da1f912e71d1e0b34eb4161e8e/0_191_3004_1803/master/3004.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc23a0b20777459d32184c3defa60ee","title":"jeremy corbyn weak leadership labour poverty john mcdonnell","story":"With dexterity, decisiveness and a thwack of firm leadership, Jeremy Corbyn sacked Dianne Hayter last night as shadow Brexit minister. (She can’t be fired from her elected role as deputy leader of the Lords.) With just that same speed, he expelled Alastair Campbell from the Labour party in May, as a dead-cat distraction following Labour’s disastrous European election results.What had Hayter done? She had deployed a somewhat tired old political metaphor, “the bunker mentality”, comparing Corbyn’s inner circle to the paranoid denial of disastrous reality that defined Hitler’s last days. The same was said of Thatcher’s final hours in power, in denial over her poll tax calamity. It was said of Gordon Brown in his telephone-hurling phase, of Tony Blair’s secretive sofa government and of Harold Wilson’s kitchen cabinet. It’s never a good idea to use Hitler as a metaphor for anything else, but Corbyn’s spokesman’s claim that her words were “grossly insensitive to Jewish staff” would be laughable if it didn’t look like such a pathetic attempt to ert criticism from the party’s failure to deal with antisemitism, which Corbyn should have scotched more than a year ago.The incestuously tight little McCluskeyite group who run Corbyn’s office is responsible for fatally dilatory foot-dragging on this far-left Jew-baiting bile. Panorama’s evidence of their interference was dismissed out of hand, with no pause for reflection. This cabal is to blame for Labour’s catastrophic Brexit non-position. The only time the cabal acts fast is when their own position is personally threatened by critics: any new leader would dispense with their unhelpful services. Hayter may have taken the drop in revenge for the advert in yesterday’s  published by 64 Labour peers (whose number did not include Hayter), which attacked Corbyn over antisemitism.The result of these fatal errors on Brexit and antisemitism has been a flight of members: you find grieving ex-Labour people everywhere. But they make a great mistake in leaving, as their votes and voices will be needed to haul Labour back from this exceptionally weak leadership: they should rejoin.There it is, in a nutshell, the reason why people vote Labour. Anything that gets in the way of that objective, anything making Labour less electable, betrays that primal mission.With eloquence, he expounded why “social mobility” is the wrong target, rejecting the idea that “poverty is OK as long as some people are given the opportunity to climb out of it”. That punctures what I heard one Tory minister at a conference fringe meeting calling for: the need to “pick the diamonds from the rough”. Social mobility is what happens in more equal societies, as in Scandinavia: it’s a useless goal, just one measurement of a society’s social success or failure.His tough new poverty-abolition is no impossibility: it was strongly backed yesterday by Claire Ainsley, executive director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. She said: “This significant ambition to eliminate in-work poverty is the right thing to do.”Is it possible? Setting the highest targets is the best way: Tony Blair astounded a room full of poverty researchers in 1999 when he pledged to end child poverty by 2020: at every budget that pledge forced the pace, adding to tax credits that eventually lifted a million children out of poverty. Would Labour have hit that target? Without doubt, had Labour been in power for the last decade, that progress would have continued, instead of going into screeching reverse. As with the BlairBrown child poverty target, McDonnell has chosen a target with cunning political calculation: just as poor children touch the hearts, so poverty among the “hard-working” arouses indignation, without the fear of the “moral hazard” of rewarding the feckless.Other aspects of Labour’s cleverly popular 2017 manifesto have rattled the government. Would Ofwat be delivering its severe punishment today to the greedy, profit-sucking water companies without Labour’s good commitment to take back the utilities? Yesterday Chris Grayling grovelled in front of the transport committee, promising to rescind Northern Rail’s franchise, amid more radical talk of franchising “reform”. Would student fees be up for cutting, without Labour’s pledge? Or would Nigel Farage’s Brexit party be pledging £200bn to regenerate desolate towns without Labour’s promise for an even larger regeneration bank for similar investment? Even without power, Labour still has an impact.But being in power is what really matters. If Labour arrives in office McDonnell will have to choose between competing spending needs: what comes first, the urgent need to raise benefits, or abolition of fees mainly benefiting better-off students? Socialism is the language of priorities.But first comes actually winning an election. The strong sense is that McDonnell, along with much of the shadow cabinet, is infuriated by everything that gets in the way of that. Imagine the despair of losing an election to Boris Johnson and facing another five years of social destruction. Day after day it gets clearer that Corbyn is the chief obstacle: weak, vacillating, glum and scoring the lowest ever poll ratings for an opposition leader as he fails to grasp the severity of Labour’s crisis over antisemitism and Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1f84a09fe1fa24415c361e933bf8c50c35dad58/0_410_2783_1670/master/2783.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbca83b6d92b8d9c0d924a752b14ddc2","title":"political gaffe neil kinnock ed miliband","story":"There was a time when the things our political leaders said and did carried with them the threat of censure or rebuke. The slightest misstep could presage disaster, while a proper, world-ending gaffe was like political kryptonite, something that could down even a seasoned heavyweight in seconds.They seemed to come less often back then, and the sillier ones we rejoiced in most of all. It’s widely accepted that Neil Kinnock’s time as Labour leader never recovered from the accidental dip in the sea he took on his first day in 1983. When Howard Dean tanked his 2004 bid to become Democratic nominee by yelling in a slightly weird way, we held street parties to celebrate his misfortune and he was launched into space to think about what he’d done. We all remember Ed Miliband losing the respect of the entire political class when, in 2014, he ate a bacon sandwich in approximately the only way it is possible to eat a bacon sandwich. Swallowing huge handfuls of popcorn, we pulled a giant red lever that exiled him to Twitter, where a sad, sarcastic squad of young interns soon reduced him to being a sort of plush doll mascot version of himself, doomed to tweet self-deprecating comments about his own calamitous misfortune, which we now mostly ignore.These days, such things seem quaint, since it’s 2019 and a frothing torrent of errant nonsense emerges, sluice-like, from all the people who seek to run the world. It’s not only true that those older, milder missteps would no longer prove fatal – but infinitely more sinister words and actions now go unpunished too.Boris Johnson, meanwhile, took to live television to issue a fizzing geyser of scat jazz bollocks, with the diffident swagger of a man who has worked out that he will never be held accountable for a single garbled word. It’s not just the thousand-year career of racist or hateful things he’s said, it’s that every conversational gambit with Johnson fades to entropy and, left to his own devices, each sentence becomes increasingly evacuated of sense, empty words with their meaning removed his mouth a factory floor churning out the grim, inedible husks of a thousand whey-free Mars bars. In Brussels, Ann Widdecombe used her maiden speech in the European parliament to issue a torrent of claims so patently orced from reality that the Lib Dem MEP who debunked them looked genuinely worried for her health. No one in their right mind anticipates any resignations, apologies or even a clarification for any of these recent incidents.When people peddle duplicitous or hateful speech, they’re responsible for their own actions, but there’s plenty of blame to go around for the social order that allows that speech to flourish. It doesn’t help that some political operators succeed by making their vileness a feature, not a bug, rendering them immune from scrutiny. When then-Ukip leader Henry Bolton’s girlfriend was found to have written racist texts about Meghan Markle last year, he was removed on the understanding that he risked bringing the party’s reputation into disrepute. Had he only possessed the foresight to go for the Tory leadership rather than Ukip’s, he could have written those sentiments himself in the form of a hilarious  article, and he’d be in line for the top job. It seems that bad faith actors, who once feared the censure and scorn of an observant press, now know that the 24-hour news cycle has diluted the impact of their vitriol to near homeopathic levels. If all the talking heads can do is make you feel bad about yourself for a few hours, then you just need to be the kind of person who doesn’t mind when people try to make you feel bad – soon enough, those very same talking heads will be forced to discuss some other, newer scandal, quite possibly of your own making.Serious-minded journalists attempting to shame a Johnson or a Trump now seem like hapless substitute teachers, desperately trying to regain control of the class. It hurts to single out the BBC, but it sometimes seems that its preferred tactic for dealing with the increase in false or racist rhetoric being spouted by politicians and pundits is to invite them on to all of their programmes for ever. This, while allowing other, nicer people to speak immediately after them, who will hopefully say that Muslims don’t look like letterboxes after all, or that Boer war concentration camps were actually bad, so that it all balances out in a sort of “one in, one out” revolving door of normalised hatred and dishonesty. If indecent exposure suddenly spiked all over the UK, one wonders if the producers of Question Time would include at least one frantically masturbating man on the panel each week, to better represent this kooky new craze for frenzied onanism sweeping the UK. They would probably consider it, so long as they made sure they had at least one other person on the panel who would make sure not to masturbate, and in the strongest possible terms.The consequences of allowing these kinds of ideas to propagate, unanswered, in the public sphere, are not just rhetorical. Some people like to point toward today’s society and moan that political correctness is stymying free speech, invading our college campuses, and ruining our best-loved telly. If anything, they say, we’re too tolerant of others. It’s quite clear that the opposite is the case, as race-hate crimes are rising in England and Wales, and crimes against the LGBT community have doubled since 2014 – none of which is offset by a female Doctor Who and more black people in period dramas.It has been a boom year for bigots and liars, and we need to stop coddling those who think otherwise. In a post-shame political landscape, we can’t run political coverage like an honesty-box fruit stall in a small village churchyard.If appealing to the decency of indecent people is the only weapon in our arsenal, then we must learn a few new tricks. The old kryptonite’s not working, and a new race of shameless supervillains is flourishing before our eyes.• Séamas O’Reilly is a writer from Derry"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89986ba491f250d5ae445cc1595e971fafbaa768/0_74_1359_815/master/1359.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ddf201078f91dbf5b5afdbc2c3486f2","title":"sadiq khan tulip london skyline","story":"Tulipmania is no more. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has rejected Norman Foster’s 1,000ft “Tulip” for the City of London, crowning an unhappy week for the architect. On the same day, his obsession with “iconic” edifices hit a wall in Paris, where his gigantic twin towers at La Défense were rejected. Khan for once agreed with Historic England and others that the Tulip was just “a lift shaft with a bulge on top” – a bulge with unpleasant blisters on its side. He did not like it at all.If Khan really does now see some virtue in design quality, it is a bit late. Refusing Foster seems a bit hard, given that a few blisters might have softened the edge of the widely condemned Walkie Talkie down the street. It might even have deflected attention from the outrageous 22 Bishopsgate next door, which Khan approved. Its bland bulk, second in height only to the Shard, makes the Tulip look like a Rembrandt. As for Khan’s sudden attention to surrounding street-scape, one wonders if this is a true revelation or a passing fad. No London planner has worried about public space at street level in living memory – witness the surroundings of the Shard or Vauxhall Tower, both much championed by Ken Livingstone.To be fair to Khan, his mayoralty inherited a desperate legacy. Nothing in his predecessor Johnson’s likely forthcoming premiership will outlast in public perception his London skyline. Before becoming mayor, Johnson swore he would end Livingstone’s priapic fixation with “Manhattanising” London. He pledged there would be “no Dubai-on-Thames”. As mayor he instantly reneged on this pledge. He appointed the developer-friendly Edward Lister as planning supremo and let rip.Johnson’s particular favouritism was towards speculative towers attracting foreign money, like those now rising along the South Bank from Vauxhall to Nine Elms. He called it inward investment. When the Battersea Power Station development – actually launched in Kuala Lumpur – hit trouble in 2014, Johnson rushed to Malaysia to plead with investors (in the end the government) to bail it out. By the time Johnson left office, New London Architecture was estimating some 400 buildings of over 20 storeys were under construction or approved. It was Dubai-on-Thames with a vengeance. But at least people lived in Dubai. The London of Johnson and Khan is of seething streets and empty towers.Under the London County and Greater London councils, policy was that high buildings should be clustered, as in the City, and should not loom over the parks and the Thames corridor. Under Thatcher’s direct rule in the 1980s and then under three elected mayors, this discipline collapsed. Central London is already splattered with empty and gleaming glass erections, financed by money launderers and sovereign wealth funds and with a lack of regulation that leaves foreign cities amazed. When one day the speculators vanish, the gates are locked, the lifts rust and the windows crack, I imagine people will gaze on them, as on the towers of Tuscany’s San Gimignano, and ask, what on earth were they for?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ea86c9989077ec1ffcec8501e143d56e06a2ac/0_164_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4caa6eb279d044b4e26e20b9bffd677","title":"iucn red list reveals wildlife destruction from treetop to ocean floor","story":"Latest list shows extinction now threatens a third of all assessed species, from monkeys to rhino raysFrom the tops of trees to the depths of the oceans, humanity’s destruction of wildlife is continuing to drive many species towards extinction, with the latest “red list” showing that a third of all species assessed are under threat.The razing of habitats and hunting for bushmeat has now driven seven primates into decline, while overfishing has pushed two families of extraordinary rays to the brink. Pollution, dams and over-abstraction of freshwater are responsible for serious declines in river wildlife from Mexico to Japan, while illegal logging is ravaging Madagascar’s rosewoods, and disease is decimating the American elm.The red list, produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is the most authoritative assessment of the status of species. The list published on Thursday adds almost 9,000 new species, bringing the total to 105,732, though this is a fraction of the millions of species thought to live on Earth. Not a single species was recorded as having improved in status.“Nature is declining at rates unprecedented in human history,” said Jane Smart, director of the IUCN bioersity conservation group. She said decisive action was needed to halt the decline, with next year’s UN bioersity convention summit in China seen as crucial.The red list highlights the plight of wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes, known as rhino rays because of their elongated snouts. They are now the most imperilled marine fish families in the world, with all but one of the 16 species critically endangered – meaning they are one step from extinction. Intensified and unregulated fishing is to blame, with the rays usually snared as bycatch.Among the seven primate species pushed closer to extinction, six are in west Africa where deforestation and bushmeat hunting is rife. There are now just 2,000 Roloway monkeys left in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, meaning their population is precariously small. Their relatively large body size and the value of their meat and skin have made them a preferred target for hunters.Humanity’s thirst for fresh water, particularly for farming, is having an especially big impact on river and lake wildlife. The red list update reveals that more than half of the freshwater fish in Japan and over a third in Mexico are now threatened with extinction. Recent research found two-thirds of the world’s great rivers no longer flow freely.“The loss of these freshwater fish species would deprive billions of people of a critical source of food and income, and could have knock-on effects on entire ecosystems,” said William Darwall, head of the IUCN freshwater bioersity unit.The red list update also added 500 deep-sea bony fish species, such as bioluminescent lanternfishes, which face potential threats from deep-fishing, oil and gas drilling and seabed mining. The scaly-foot snail is the first mollusc that lives on deep-sea hydrothermal vents to be added to the list and is assessed as endangered.“Invasive diseases, together with air pollution and climate change, have decimated populations of numerous North American tree species that once provided abundant food for native wildlife, as well scenic beauty,” said Healy Hamilton, at NatureServe, a network of bioersity scientists.Fungi are a growing feature of the list, with the update revealing that at least 15 species that grow in the traditional countryside of many European countries are now threatened with extinction. The bright red splendid waxcap, found in the UK and Germany, is one which has suffered as semi-natural grasslands have been converted to intensive agriculture.“Loss of species and climate change are the two great challenges facing humanity this century,” said Lee Hannah at Conservation International. The red list addresses both, he said, by including the threat of global heating in the assessment of extinction risk. “The results are clear, we must act now on both.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3070d1277efca9e5f84d3ab971ebd84d44aba782/0_230_7360_4415/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=391825ecd83bf400ed1cbf29f7c88ea4","title":"locations of 50 new london water fountains revealed","story":"Work starts on first wave of 100 fountains to be installed in drive to cut single-use plasticsThe locations of the first 50 of a £5m wave of public drinking water fountains earmarked for the capital have been announced.The first of the new fountains – which people are encouraged to use to refill their own bottles – are being installed from this week, predominantly in tube and mainline train stations, shopping centres, markets and recreation grounds. Designed to withstand outdoor temperatures and all weathers, the fountains are attached to the mains water supply and feature a distinctive design with a giant blue “waterdrop” to make them easy to spot.Last year plans for 20 fountains were unveiled in a ground-breaking joint venture between the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and partners. This was followed by an agreement with Thames Water to build on the success and install a further 100-plus facilities between spring this year and the end of 2020.Thames Water and the mayor’s office are each contributing £2.5m to fund the venture, with the mayor’s share coming from cash earmarked for tackling the issue of single-use plastic.Khan’s predecessor and Tory leadership hopeful, Boris Johnson – expected to become prime minister next week – announced “a new era of public fountains” in 2008 but did not follow it through.The move comes amid growing public concern over plastic pollution in the world’s oceans. In the UK 38.5m plastic bottles are used every day just over half of those make it to recycling, while more than 16m are put into landfill, burned, or leak into the environment and oceans. The average Londoner buys more than three plastic water bottles every week. has learned that retail giant John Lewis is in discussions with the metal water bottle brand S’well about a partnership that would lead to the first free water fountain being installed in one of its London stores.Meanwhile, London’s Borough Market is to introduce a fourth water fountain as part of its aim to become the UK’s biggest entirely plastic-free food shopping destination.The mayor’s office is also supporting a parallel drive to make free tap water accessible to consumers via the City to Sea refill app, with 2,500 restaurant chains including Leon and Costa Coffee now participating. The Refill campaign persuades businesses to sign up to a scheme allowing people to refill their water bottles on their premises rather than throw them away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d011b9ba4b7dcd235cf95b4a48e98fb1272157de/0_88_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30c23d29cf5ead749878286378b79b80","title":"the impact is tremendous readers on wildflower verges","story":"Readers share how wildflowers are bringing colour and life to previously sterile green spacesCatastrophic news for insect life has inspired communities and councils around the UK to take action, generating splashes of summer colour which hope to have a lasting impact.After reporting a campaign by the conservation charity Plantlife to encourage the growth and planting of flowers on UK roadside verges, we asked you to share stories from where you are.Below, readers share some of their local successes, including thoughts about how leaving nature to run its course by standing back rather than taking action can help – and explain how they have been getting involved in community projects big and small.“Hengrove Way is a 1960s dual carriageway in the south of Bristol. The wide central verge was originally reserved for a tram system but was planted a few years ago with an avenue of purple beech trees. The meadow here is sown annually by the Bristol city council parks. Budgets are tight and so they try and make a little spread a long way – in this case there are over 300 metres of flowers: as a resident they give me much enjoyment.” Richard, Bristol“Three neighbouring families with five children grouped together to care for three unloved grass verges adjacent to our homes in Flackwell Heath, Buckinghamshire. We planted yellow rattle to compete with the grass annuals to provide colour in year one, and perennials from year two onwards. We lovingly named our patch Flack Wild Heath.“I was mowing the verges myself each week anyway, and over a beer with our neighbours, we decided we should give it a go. We’ve had lots of interest and look forward to new friends in the village extending the Heath from next year. More of us should do the same it’s easy to sit back and wait for the council or someone else. Actually though, there’s way more pleasure in seeing our own patch develop. Very rewarding. In fact, it’s ace arriving home each day to see what’s popped up.” Marcus Firmin, Buckinghamshire“I planted this wildflower bank earlier this year on the edge of a path which overlooks a meadow outside my home. The idea is to develop areas that give colour to the meadow as well as attracting different types of wildlife, while trying just to manage small areas and keeping things as natural as possible.” David Warr, Jersey“It seems that council cuts have resulted in random scalping of verges and open spaces, with what appears to be no real plan, but they seem happy when community groups such as ours, with some skill, take on their sites. We’re sure we can save them money, improve the environment, spread beauty and pollen – there are so many advantages there seems no reason not to!” Diana Cusack, Totnes“Taken this week whilst on my way into the town centre. One of many small urban spaces that have been planted by the local council.” James, Newport“As a gardener, I know the work involved in preparing and maintaining verges. As long as vehicle sight lines are maintained where necessary, I feel this verge on the Kegworth bypass is a superb example of how the natural environment is so much more attractive than the sterile, known alternative. I am a gardener at a nearby university where the campus has initiated a bioersity scheme to encourage wildlife within its grounds. A number of areas are being left unmown poorer ground is being seeded with suitable wildflower mixes. The study will try to identify any change in the number of plants animals and insects within campus.” Dave Bicker, Loughborough“This verge on both sides of a wide dual carriageway and on the central reservation was planted by nature. Each year, Surrey county council mows it all flat when the flowers are in bloom, citing safety, although the extent is clearly excessive by common sense standards. This deprives stressed motorists of an uplifting and soothing experience on their journey, as well as disrupting or terminating the lives of countless amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates. Planting verges is good: but don’t forget nature did it first, and all we have to do is respect and wonder.” Jenny Desoutter, Dorking“These are not planted – they’re wild native plants! I monitor two of our local verges for the Yorkshire Dales national park’s Orton Special Verges project: we don’t plant verges and do not think we need to do it.“We need to educate people about what we already have as our native flora. It’s better to conserve the flora that will naturally grow in meadows and verges, for example by not mowing too soon (apart from a safety strip if needed for visibility). Late mowing, to let grassland plants set seed, and taking off the mowings to keep fertility low will allow native plants to regenerate as well as being cheaper for the councils than year round mowing or trying to seed verges with plants that want arable conditions.” Sue Millard, Cumbria“Burleys, Lewes district council and Wildflower Lewes have been planting up verges across Lewes District for three years. There are several different types of meadows, those that are more bioersity rich – which are perennial wildflowers – are sown once and then left to get on with it, year on year. The other meadows are the annual wildflower seeds chosen for our pollinators – these are much prettier and have to be sown yearly. These mini-meadows are scattered across roadside verges, recreation fields, housing estates and cemeteries. This year all the meadows were teeming with butterflies, bees, grasshopper and crickets. It’s amazing just how many insects benefit from such small areas.“We want to improve the bioersity of our district, educate and inspire others to do the same and hopefully they will get closer to nature by visiting more green spaces. We plant chalk-loving plug plants in some areas to create mini-downland areas in the hope that residents will get out more, reducing social isolation and improving health and wellbeing. We receive many compliments about how the wildflower verges have make them happy on their way to work and school – the wider impact a small patch of ground can have on people is tremendous and shouldn’t be underestimated.” Karen Rigby-Faux, Lewes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d26aa46f59114f854d69959bf8d93f8a88e5d8/0_0_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4d579cee5c25955c14f3e530e76877c","title":"raising the steaks how to have a fancy barbecue","story":"Tired of guests taking you for granted while you slave over a hot grill? Try your hand at marinated goat, deconstructed ratatouille or boozy poultryThere is a lot to be said for barbecues, including smell, taste, poignant memories of summers past, licensed overeating and the ubiquity of coleslaw, but I have noticed one thing: the chef never gets any credit. It is a bit of reverse sexism: men usually take over, in what we can call “manflipping” or “pyromannia”, so if you praise the chef, you are shoring up the patriarchy, even if a woman did all the marinating or, for once, the chef is actually a woman. It is mainly the sense that he or she does jack-all, beyond opening some packets. Which is fundamentally unfair, since knowing what is what on an open flame that you use twice a year is far more technically demanding than using an oven. Maybe you don’t care about credit. But if you do, here are a few suggestions.Try interesting cuts of meat. Classic barbecue fare tends towards the banal (chicken breasts) or at best workaday (the sausage). What you want is meat round a complicated bone, to give it some structure and slow-release flavour against the suddenness of the heat, and what you get is a load of steaks that have very few defences. I would never barbecue steaks again, having discovered that you can cook them in an air fryer, which locks in flavour without leeching out moisture. The best barbie cut, meanwhile, flash-fried, perfect unadorned, is the Barnsley chop. The nubbly central bone that gives it that butterfly shape makes it unusually juicy, while the fat turns to lamb crackling, which you almost never see in domestic life.Better still, try an unusual meat. In an unassuming yet peerless book, My Bombay Kitchen, Niloufer Ichaporia King has a recipe for shoulder of kid, in which you poach it first, marinate it for two hours in a marsala mix that includes chilli, cumin, hoisin, ginger and garlic, then stick it on coals for a quarter of an hour until it has a reddish crust that could charm a hyena out of a rage. You can use the poaching liquor for some rice on the side, and if anybody doesn’t congratulate you on this, it will be because they’re vegetarian and they hate you for it.Arguably, a sweet-fleshed piece of fish is even more of a showstopper, since it has a curious alchemy with the charcoal that underlines rather than obliterates its delicacy. It is fragile, though: unless it’s mackerel, big clumps can go through the bars, and the better it tastes, the more you resent the waste. Plus it is expensive: at the weekend I was so resistant to barbecuing a turbot – it was 24 quid it would have been like feeding pound coins into a grabber at the arcade – that Mr Z made it a cage out of coat hangers. You can only do one side this way you have to put a lid on the barbecue and let the other side cook by convection. Also, do not make the mistake of thinking the handles won’t be red hot, even when they are not red. Otherwise, it is a brilliant fish fix, and also works for a skate wing.Or else, cook regular meat in an unusual fashion. Get a can of cider, open it, put it on the grill. Get a chicken – you’ll need to poach it for 20 minutes beforehand if you don’t like to live life on the wild side – and wedge it, by its butt cavity, over the can. This works best on a barbecue that is already cooling a little, because the chicken will be here a while. Put the lid down cook for 40 minutes. Basically what happens is that the can heats up insanely and cooks the bird from the inside, while the outside cooks on the grill. The cider evaporates into the meat and keeps it moist (you can try it with lager, too), and the whole thing looks quite tickling, like a tiny gangster being taught a lesson.Mr Z does a few things for vegetarians, including chalcots, a cross between a spring onion and a leek, which you char, then wrap in newspaper. The scorched outer skin slips effortlessly off, leaving them beautifully silky inside. And deconstructed ratatouille: grill aubergine, courgette, tomato and garlic chop or mash them as they come off, then season very liberally in the bowl, as if you are making the French classic backwards, and much faster. If I’m honest, if someone asked what you were eating, you wouldn’t immediately say “ratatouille”. But you would say: “This is an innovative and delightful gesture towards the typically uncatered-to vegetarian in these circumstances.”If you think people praising you doesn’t actually matter alfresco then, of course, don’t bother with any of this and go ahead with your burgers. But I sometimes think the reason everyone eats so much off a grill is that you don’t savour things unless you can taste the effort. What I want from food is the taking of infinite pains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00d974eafb969db36b69b6274c4dbcd8d35e1e74/0_39_3121_1874/master/3121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4270ce8f35810b739680d327d00f27f5","title":"small talk carles puyol","story":"The Spanish defender talks about Barcelona, how football became his cure and clears up rumours of liking Napalm DeathWe’re talking to you because of yoghurt, why don’t you tell us a bit about that? I am very proud to be an ambassador for the Danone Nations Cup, one of the best tournaments out there for U12s to play football. It takes place at a local level in 27 countries and the final will be played in Barcelona in October.That sounds extremely wholesome. You’re a big foodie, what would you eat as a player? I’ve always given a lot of importance to food. I have to eat more to keep my tank full. What I would eat would depend on the scale of the game but on the day of the match isn’t actually as important as eating well long-term. I ate a lot of carbs and protein, specifically white meat.You lost your father at the height of your career with Barcelona. That must have been very hard to deal with. It was a very difficult time. It was an accident and one I didn’t see coming. That said, football really helped me to move forward and heal over time. Football was my cure and my support.What was it like growing up with your parents in Catalonia? I came from a hard-working, working-class background and had a very happy childhood. I grew up in La Pobla de Segur, which is a small town in the Pyrenees in northern Catalonia. I remember going to school and playing on the pitch opposite. When I moved to Barcelona as a teenager it was a huge change. However, the two years I spent at La Masia were two of my best years. It was a bit like scouts, with 40 boys sharing four rooms. Each one was trying to make their dreams come true.Yeah, things seemed to work out for you with that one. You were a pivotal part of the Spain side that won Euro 2008 and the World Cup in 2010. Did you watch much of the Women’s World Cup? The Women’s World Cup was really booming and I’m happy to see the growth of importance in the media for it. I wouldn’t feel at ease choosing one player – for me the most important thing is to see the positive impact the players are having on young girls and beyond.What did you make of USA’s 13-0 win over Thailand? I saw the result. I understand the importance of scoring and winning but when celebrating goals you need to control yourself. You should always respect the opposition. After the fifth or sixth goal, you should tone it down. I see fair play as a manner of both understanding sport and being human. I am naturally competitive and I want to win but I also believe in compassion. Against Rayo Vallecano, I broke up a celebration when we were winning 5-0. We wanted to enjoy the goals but not destroy the other team’s self-esteem. I also once invited Ronaldinho to appear in Barcelona’s team photo before we played AC Milan because I wanted to show the importance of self-respect. He was a great player for us and I wanted the game to be played in a positive manner.What would you have been if you weren’t a footballer? I’m not sure. It would have to be something in sport. Maybe a coach?OK! Small Talk has also read that you like the British extreme death metal band Napalm Death, a Birmingham band that describe themselves as having “an enduring impact on the world of sonic savagery.” It’s not true.

The tension of the landing and the images of astronauts in futuristic spacesuits striding over the moon’s barren surface, Earth reflected in their oversized visors, would prove wildly influential to artists, writers and film-makers.Also watching were the soon-to-be proponents of another technological field populated by brilliant young geeks: computer games. It is perhaps no coincidence that during the early 1960s, when Nasa was working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Instrumentation Lab to develop the guidance and control systems for Apollo spacecraft, elsewhere on campus a programmer named Steve Russell was working with a small team to create one of the first true video game experiences.Inspired by the space race, and using the same DEC PDP-1 model of mainframe computer that generated spacecraft telemetry data for Nasa’s Mariner programme, Russell wrote Spacewar!, a simple combat game in which two players controlled starships with limited fuel, duelling around the gravitational well of a nearby star. Although only playable in university research labs, SpaceWar! was hugely influential on the nascent games industry, inspiring Atari founder Nolan Bushnell’s first coin-operated arcade game Computer Space and later the classic Asteroids, which also attempted to simulate the physics of gravity, thrust and inertia.In the 70s, Bushnell and Atari were fascinated with the space programme. The fourth designer hired at the company, Dennis Koble, previously worked on biofeedback at the Nasa Ames Research Centre, while coder Steve Kitchen spent 18 months researching the STS-2 shuttle flight to write the Atari 2600 simulator game Space Shuttle: A Journey Into Space. Before its release in 1983, the authenticity of the game was tested by Dr Ed Gibson, an astronaut and physicist who worked on the development of the Skylab space station.The 1969 moon landing also directly inspired a genre of games known as lunar lander simulations, in which players had to fight against the limitations of their craft’s technology – and Newtonian physics – to land safely on the cratered surface. Probably the first example was a text-based simulation, written in 1969 by teenage coder Jim Storer. Watching the Apollo missions on TV, he developed a fascination with the demanding logistics of space flight. At the time he was attending Lexington high school in Massachusetts, near the headquarters of Digital Equipment Corporation, and had access to a PDP-8 mainframe computer.“I was a science major and the idea that we were going to set foot on a surface that wasn’t the Earth was exciting. But what I was most interested in were the computers,” says Storer. It is amazing how they managed to get to the moon with such primitive technology. It had nothing approaching the power of an iPhone.”The limitations of Nasa’s computing power reflected the challenges all early programmers faced. As Storer recalls, “The computer we had at our school was a huge cabinet but all it had was 12kb of memory and 8kb of that was the operating system. So you had 4kb and that was shared between eight users. It was hard because you had to keep track of every line of code. If there had been one more line in my program, the computer couldn’t have run it. So what I wrote was a question and answer game – at each stage of the landing you’d find out your current velocity and then you had to enter in how much fuel to use. If you burned fuel too early, you stopped too high and end up crashing to the ground – it’s a delicate balance to make a graceful landing without hitting the moon too hard.”A slew of other moon landing simulations followed, including Atari’s 1979 arcade hit Lunar Lander and the early home-computer title Jupiter Lander, both requiring the player to employ deft joystick control and careful use of the thrust button to land on rocky surfaces. In 1982, Rendezvous: A Space Shuttle Simulation, an educational sim programmed by Nasa scientist Wesley Huntress, was released. Later titles expanded on the core rotate-and-thrust inputs of the lunar lander games into larger environments. Atari’s Gravitar and BBC Micro release Thrust both had players navigating complex extraterrestrial environments in tiny spaceships resembling classic Apollo landing craft.But as home-computer technology advanced, developers became more ambitious, looking beyond the lunar surface towards the vastness beyond. Released in 1984, legendary BBC Micro adventure Elite simulated whole galaxies and used simple vector graphics to capture the quiet, sparse beauty of space travel. Co-creator David Braben was five years old in 1969, but recalls watching the landing live on television and was later given a View-Master toy with moon landing photographs in 3D.The Voyager influence is especially clear in Elite – that sense of hopping from planet to planet in a tiny vulnerable craft, watching the stars drift past. But Braben also sees other important parallels between the space programme and the early years of the games industry beyond the cultural impact.“One of the achievements attributed to the space programme was the development of the silicon chip,” he says. “Prior to that, manufacturers were using inidual transistors which were extremely bulky, and shielding was a challenge. So from a technical point of view, the amount of money and learning that came from the space programme in terms of how to make small, light pieces of electronics that didn’t use too much power really enabled home computers. Without integrated circuits, they wouldn’t have been realistic from a cost point of view.”The imagery, technology and aesthetics of the Apollo programme remain with game developers to this day. The sense of peril and isolation is there in the Dead Space series, in Destiny, and in the space station thriller Observation, while the idea of interplanetary exploration feeds into both Elite Dangerous, with its authentic database of 150,000 star systems, and No Man’s Sky, which channels the idealism of the Voyager mission into a vast, hypnotic open-universe adventure.Perhaps the next time a human being sets foot on the Sea of Tranquility, it won’t just be game designers watching. It will be game designers putting them there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f3ff73086336535c6e036d8780decd843614aef/0_104_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cc60e031e387a32b228d3ec75ca6309","title":"we just clicked why i set out to find a new group of friends online","story":"Can a friendship app, a digital neighbourhood noticeboard or Facebook really help me discover a new bestie?This year started with a bang. It burst into life with fireworks and kisses, and then came the sound of a spoon tapping on a wine glass. “Since we’re all together,” said my friend, “I wanted to say it’s been an honour knowing you while I’ve been in London.”Another leaving speech. I have heard many over the past few years, watching loved ones leave in search of job opportunities or housing security, or as a cure for homesickness. Later, as I lay in bed, I thought about my rate of friend attrition. How long until I found myself totally alone? Five years? Ten? My new year resolution was a no-brainer: I must try to make new friends.To help me on my journey, I contact Kate Leaver, author of The Friendship Cure, a book exploring modern friendship. She was inspired to write it by an article in the Atlantic, in which journalist Julie Beck argued that we shed friendships as we age because our spouses (to whom we are legally bound) and our family (to whom we are biologically bound) fill our worlds. When that happens, friendships are the first to go. “That article essentially frightened me into a year-long research binge so I could make the case for reviving our interest and our investment in friendship,” says Leaver.She says we have “organised our modern lives so that we’re more isolated than we think we are”. Social media makes us believe we are surrounded by people, and we may mistake likes and comments for intimacy. Offline, meanwhile, we have been brought up to believe it is unacceptable to speak to strangers, even as traditional public spaces – libraries, sports centres – are being closed down. In the few spaces that remain, she says: “We’re left with all these grown adults not knowing how to make new friends or get close to people.”This rings painfully true. I go to the gym two or three times a week, yet my visits are silent. I don’t enjoy the gym I do it so I don’t drop dead in 30 years. I pass through, barely making eye contact, let alone exchanging words. Can the internet help me make friends there? I decide to follow my gym on Instagram, commenting on its posts alongside other members. Mostly, these are health fanatics and their comments are just fire emojis (a symbol that means exciting or excellent) – so I’m not sure how I could build intimacy. I try to get involved anyway, heaping praise and asking questions. Later, at the gym, I approach another user, a man who looks as if he is in his late 20s, and ask if he was the person I saw on Instagram winning a fitness challenge. He was. We swap names and talk about where we live. If we have lots in common, it is not immediately apparent. Perhaps it is our millennial inability to carry on a conversation, or perhaps we are both tired after exercise, but the chat dwindles. We don’t speak when our paths cross again, but I do get a wave now and then.I also download a friend-making app – Bumble BFF. I am already using Bumble for dating and it is easy enough to toggle between the friends and romance platforms. I even use the same bio: “lefty journalist from London, climbing the ladder of success wrong by wrong”. I think it is charming, but other women do not. My rate of matches in the friend setting is significantly lower than in the romance section. I initiate a conversation with every match I receive, but notice that potential friendships are not tended with the same energy as possible romances. Perhaps Beck is right – in the choice between love and friendship, pals always lose.The swipe functionality of Bumble BFF also makes me uncomfortable. Like the romance portion, you swipe right to say you like the profile, left to say you don’t. And you can make this decision based on one picture, rather than needing to take in the whole profile before you give your verdict. You cannot move on to another profile until you have cast your judgment, so you are primed to decide within seconds in order to sate your curiousity about who is next. Inevitably, I find myself judging other women based on their looks – on what I think their clothes communicate about their personality, or what the set up of their shots says about their interests – and no doubt I am being judged similarly. It hurts to be reduced to this, and more so than it does when it is by the opposite sex.Using an app for friendship rather than romance also drives home how chatting online with strangers is not a patch on talking face to face, when communication comes through many mediums – tone, body language, expression – all processed in an instant. Even a few words tell you so much. Perhaps we put up with it in our love lives because the “prize” of romance is put on such a high pedestal. Using the same tools to search for a friend reveals how truly blunt they are. I struggle to create any intimacy, or puncture the polite veneer of the chat box (“How are you today?” “I am fine. How are you?”). It makes sense: I am ultimately a stranger, no matter how many laughs we share, or how much we agree on Brexit. We all keep our guard up for strangers. They could be anyone, and so could I. Each conversation is taking a punt. And we may be more likely to do it for love than friendship.In the end, I manage to have proper conversations with a couple of women. They seem very nice, but live a bit too far away to meet. I lose momentum and feel frustrated with the app. I say my goodbyes and delete it.However, there is another number that Dunbar says is important to friendships: 30. One of the biggest barriers to meaningful friendships is distance, with 30 minutes being the longest time we would spend travelling to meet up. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s on foot, by bicycle or car, 30 minutes’ travel time is the tipping point. It is not our observation, but something that sociologists have commented on.”With this in mind, I prioritise making friends near home. I download a community app, Nextdoor, which is regularly listed as one of the best apps through which to make friends. It effectively acts as a digital noticeboard for your local area, including adverts for evening classes and book clubs, which both seem like prime buddy-making opportunities. But nobody is idly chatting on Nextdoor. It is not obvious how you can build online relationships when replying to posts about parking permits or moths giving people a rash. However, on another community website, the hyper-local Harringay Online, I notice a post from my neighbour – to whom I have never spoken, despite living next to her for several years. When I see her in the local pub, I strike up a conversation about her post. Success! We get on. We have a drink and become Facebook friends.It may seem daft to view nurturing an acquaintanceship with someone who lives next to you as an accomplishment. But it has forced me to challenge my own strict belief that people – above anything else, even above my desire to chat – have a right to be left alone. It simply feels rude to “bother” people I need a suitable reason. Even using an app such as Bumble BFF, which is designed to introduce people, does not help. After all, just because someone uses the same app as me does not mean they want to speak to me.However, research suggests we have a warped impression of other people’s reluctance to talk to us. The average person consistently underestimates how much a stranger has enjoyed speaking to them. This has been termed “the liking gap”, although, it is worth noting that it applies to real-life interactions, not digital ones.Still, I wonder if my existing social media connections may be the most fruitful source of friends. They have already expressed an interest in me as an inidual, and I should have some sense of them as people and be confident that we have something in common. Indeed, I met one of my closest friends on my favourite platform, Twitter.I return to the chasm of hyperbole and scroll through the lists of people I follow and who follow me, looking out for those I regularly engage with. I send direct messages to a few. Every single person replies. Shared interests spring up easily and conversation comes naturally, as does an offer to catch up in person.I also take to Facebook searching for something similar, but as I barely use the platform, it instead acts as a time capsule for a past version of me. I joined Facebook in 2006 and used it actively (pointless statuses, pokes, and all), but from 2011 my interaction with it slowed. Now I check in periodically, but barely engage. With a large proportion of Facebook friends being people I met more than 10 years ago, I am not sure I still have anything in common with many of them. But perhaps Facebook’s supposed aim – to keep us connected with people we might otherwise lose contact with – will come in handy. Jeffrey Hall, a researcher from the University of Kansas, found that you need 80-100 hours to become friends with someone, or 200 hours to become close friends. But what if you have already racked up those hours? This is why one of the easiest ways to make friends is to reconnect with old ones. And there are plenty of old friends on Facebook.I contact Paul, my BFF from sixth-form college. He went to a different university and, although we tried to stay in touch, our paths erged over time. We chat briefly online, opting to meet for dinner right away. The dinner is like old times and there is no distance between us even though so much has changed. We discuss our respective new partners and what happened to the old ones, our new jobs and where we hope to go, as well as our old hobbies, which remain the same (writing and film-watching). The shared sense of humour and curiosity about the world makes for a joyful meal. We arrange to meet again, and remain in touch.In some ways, it is comforting to assume we lose touch with people because we grow apart. The alternative is that our own idleness or inattention slowly separates us from those we once connected with. Perhaps friendships are more elusive than we think, and so delicate they will die unless actively nurtured. The internet is not a silver bullet for loneliness – indeed, it may distort our natural behaviour and our understanding of what friendship is. But it can at least signpost where meaningful meetings may happen, and it can keep you in the loop of existing relationships.Leaver tells me about the twentysomethings she interviewed for her book. “One of them said she felt like the TV show Friends had lied to her because she grew up expecting to get this neat group of friends. I think loneliness in young people is partly explained by the gap between their expectations and the reality.”As for me, my search for new friends brings me back to old friends, to friendly faces I see each day and those I already know, but have not given enough attention to. I count up all the messages I regularly forget to reply to, and the old work colleagues I adored, but lost touch with. And I send an overdue text using three, magic words: “Fancy a catchup?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50407bad9513c7f2c1a0846ab2858617f08592da/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d40cb837ff856a35f1e397d16b3aa965","title":"let down by natwest new cheque scanning system","story":"Reader who runs small business is out of pocket because of NatWest’s software updateI run a small manufacturing business in Devon.

They began life as a minor psychedelic alt-rock band with seemingly zero mainstream commercial potential beyond hand-to-mouth survival, on the same US post-punk gig circuit that supported umpteen bands with zero mainstream commercial potential in the mid-80s. When they were signed to a major label in 1991, it looked like one of the grandest acts of folly yet in the crazed search to find the next Nirvana: their debut release under their new deal was an EP called Yeah I Know It’s a Drag, But Wastin’ Pigs Is Still Radical. Like a number of bands signed in the post-grunge goldrush, they had a minor novelty hit – 1994’s She Don’t Use Jelly – and that appeared to be that.And then the damnedest thing happened: The Flaming Lips released the extraordinary 1999 album The Soft Bulletin, developed an equally extraordinary live show and became something like a mainstream success. Its successor, 2002’s Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots sold half a million copies in the US alone and won a Grammy, which the Flaming Lips seemed to take as a signal to let their imaginations run riot in the most confounding way. They released unwatchable Christmas films, 24-hour long songs, experimental double albums that frontman Wayne Coyne promoted with the suggestion that it “would have made a better single album if only the artist could have focused themselves”, a series of releases on which they covered The Dark Side of the Moon, Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and the Stone Roses’ eponymous debut in their entirety, and a collaboration with Ke$ha that was pressed on vinyl containing Ke$ha’s menstrual blood, etc.On the one hand, hooray for a band resolutely refusing to cave in to commercial pressure. On the other, a lot of this stuff has definitely muddied the water between “fearless and unbridled artistic experimentation” and “apparently just testing everyone’s patience for the sake of it”.It says something about their releases in the intervening years that Kings’ Mouth has been greeted as a concise return to form: a concept album accompanied by an immersive art exhibition and a children’s book, about a monarch with a giant head that contains galaxies and weather systems, narrated by former Clash guitarist Mick Jones. The latter’s contributions are very much in the vein of Stanley Unwin’s appearances on the Small Faces’ 1968 psychedelic opus Ogdens’ Nut Gone Flake, and, it has to be said, don’t make much more sense than the inventor of Basic Engly Twenty Fido enquiring if you’re sitting comfortabold two square on your botty. It’s a moot point as to whether Jones sounds either rapt with innocent wonder as he reads, or like a man who hasn’t got a clue what he’s supposed to be going on about.Still, after pausing for a moment to reflect on the reaction of the spittle-flecked audience at The Roxy in 1977 had they been informed that the Clash’s guitarist was going to end up narrating a psychedelic concept album about a monarch with a head that contained galaxies, it’s hard not to concede that the advance publicity on King’s Mouth (initially released in a limited vinyl-only edition on Record Store Day) is correct. Despite the concept and accompanying folderol, what lies at its heart are a succession of songs more straightforwardly appealing than anything the Flaming Lips have come up with in years. Only the brief instrumental Mother Universe speaks of the kind of self-indulgence that’s marked out their recent releases. It’s nothing as craven as a direct return to the sound of The Soft Bulletin and Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots – it’s comparatively stripped-down, less widescreen in its musical ambitions, more obviously reliant on electronics that sound like electronics rather than a dense patchwork of samples – but it shares with those albums the sense of a band marshalling their energies and abundance of outre ideas into relatively short, honed, lushly melodic bursts.At their best – Mouth of the King, All For the Life of the City – the songs here are a total joy, reacquainting you with certain strengths the Flaming Lips have tended to obfuscate on recent releases. Multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd has the ability to mould a wildly varied set of musical backdrops into a cohesive whole – the album goes from the fidgety distorted funk of Feedaloodum Beetle Dot to the 10cc-ish AOR of The Sparrow to the cinematic, choral sample-bedecked instrumental Funeral Parade without seeming disjointed, largely because whatever style they’re essaying, it somehow always sounds like the Flaming Lips. Wayne Coyne can still project childlike wonder and homespun wisdom without sounding cloying. From Do You Realize? to Waitin’ for Superman, Flaming Lips’ biggest songs have frequently hinged on presenting lyrical ideas that look a bit trite on paper, but gain a peculiar, affecting emotional heft when delivered in Coyne’s wayward, fragile voice. It’s a trick much in evidence here: Giant Baby finds him reflecting on his mother’s death and concluding that “life is sometimes sad” on the concluding How Can a Head, he’s gawping in wonder at the powers of the human brain.How Can a Head is the album’s highlight, blessed with as lovely a melody as the band have ever written. Luxuriating in it, you’re struck by the sense that you should probably enjoy it while it lasts. If the Flaming Lips’ recent history has taught us anything, it’s that their next album will probably be confounding: abnormal service resumed.William Doyle: Nobody Else Will Tell YouThe artist formerly known as East India Youth continues down his own idiosyncratic singer-songwriter path on a psychedelic exploration of suburban living."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcfe59549992952d27c14827702c2b324bac4ff1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1004c36ecf49815729edcbe6d936ff83","title":"a sneaker peek behind the scenes at new balance","story":"Since 1982, New Balance has produced its flagship 990s at one of two US factories. We take a look at the craftsmanship that goes into each trainer at the site in MassachusettsFew trainers can claim a fanbase as erse as that of the New Balance 990 series. The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it. I know what I want to do, but they are experts and the value they add is incredible,” he says.And the atmosphere on the line embodies that spirit of collaboration. The workers move quickly – they each have just 22.5 seconds to complete their task – but still find moments to greet each other warmly.Luis Puello, a 51-year-old leather cutter, carefully runs his hands across a sheet of pig’s hide, looking for defects that he marks with a laser before a machine makes a cut. Over the years, he says, he has developed a better feel for the leather, quickly sensing which parts will function best in different areas of the shoe.He smiles when asked what he thinks about the 990s that he helps make every day. “When the job is done, you see what you’ve done, and you feel proud,” he says.New Balance’s 990v5s are available at the New Balance London flagship store or newbalance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45c4c0421651847b2fb3c89c779c96825af739a/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9104a8fbe287510bd6c4115b3bfdbaa","title":"the evolution of the new balance 99x series in pictures","story":"The New Balance 990v5 – which was released in the UK in May this year – is the latest trainer in a 37-year footwear dynasty.

He added that Hayter had been sacked “with immediate effect” for her “deeply offensive remarks about Jeremy Corbyn and his office”.Those around Corbyn had a “bunker mentality”, she said, accusing them of refusing to give key information to the party’s ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) as well as the Equality and Human Rights Commission.The row came after Theresa May called on ­Corbyn to apologise for his “failure to deal with racism” in his party. Corbyn hit back, saying Labour was totally opposed to racism. He called on May to deal with Islamophobia in the Conservative party.The Ilford North Labour MP, Wes Streeting, said Hayter’s sacking was a “gross over-reaction to a comment that was actually about Jeremy Corbyn’s bunker mentality”.He added: “This sacking only reinforces her point. The speed of this sacking shows that Labour’s leader is quick to act to protect his feelings, but slow to act against racists. The double standards are extraordinary.“Dianne Hayter remains the elected deputy leader of the Labour group in the House of Lords, regardless of ­Jeremy Corbyn’s purge.”The longstanding Labour critic Luke Akehurst was also among the attendees of Tuesday’s Labour First meeting, the Huffington Post reported. “It isn’t a bunker, it is the last days of Saigon,” he said. “It’s like they are trying to get on the helicopters trying to kick off the incumbents in these parliamentary seats, because they know their days of control are numbered.”Hayter was among four senior peers who on Monday wrote to Corbyn with an offer of establishing a panel to review the allegations of former party staffers made on Panorama and to “provide advice and support on how a properly independent complaints process could be set up and run”. The others were Angela Smith the party’s leader in the Lords, Toby ­Harris and chief whip Tommy McAvoy. In it they set out their view amid consternation about the Panorama allegations that the leader’s office interfered in complaints about antisemitism. Eight former employees appeared on the programme to discuss the handling of complaints. The party denies the allegations and complained to the BBC about the programme.After the documentary aired last Monday, a Labour party spokesman insisted the whistleblowers featured are “disaffected former officials including those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.” He added: “Labour is taking decisive action against antisemitism, doubling the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases. And since Jennie Formby became general secretary, the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with has increased fourfold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec7b07a7575c33e2bc28cd1fb6d913695c4ad44/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5c8ae63d3b252ce40203edec4d1474b","title":"cricket world cup 10 fans countries review action","story":"Readers from around the world reflect on seven weeks of cricket and one astounding finalEngland’s run to the semi-finals, and indeed final, could not have been more quintessentially English. The team came into the tournament on a great run and hope was lifted to even greater heights with a few high-quality performances, only to be met with a crash back to traditional English cynicism when we almost inevitably lost to two tournament underdogs. From this point on though, they were exceptional, rising to the challenge of what essentially became four consecutive knockout games.What else can be said about the final? It was the best game of cricket I’ve witnessed and quite possibly the best of all time. The match had it all and England finally proved that they can stand up in those pressure moments in a knockout tournament. They had no small degree of luck and there was plenty of tension, but how else would you want to win your first Cricket World Cup?Let’s hope this group stays together for one more World Cup under the cool head of Eoin Morgan and a coach who will further develop this exciting brand of cricket. It would be easy to see this as the pinnacle, but how incredible would it be to push for an Australia-esque World Cup dynasty? Matt LeechWe delivered the greatest of World Cup finals. No other countries would have produced such a game. New Zealand always get stuck into games and regularly deliver some of the greatest cricketing spectacles. It’s such a shame we remain financially uninteresting for cricketing schedulers. Winning the World Cup might have changed that, but we are worthy runners-up.Jimmy Neesham was my player of the tournament. He plays hard and fearless, keeps going and has a mental toughness and mature outlook on life. He will have plenty of big moments in his career. Malcolm EddingtonIndia were like a critically acclaimed television show. After power-packed leading performances from neo-noir legend Rohit Sharma and the experimental yet highly engaging directorship from Jasprit Bumrah, most expected that pair, along with a strong supporting cast, to help India execute a stunning finale. But, despite bringing in the biggest viewing figures, the show was cancelled at the last moment by the executives at the World Cup – the notorious Kiwis.MS Dhoni was a fan favourite, but his personal style did not suit the overall tone of the crew. Rishabh Pant, a cult hero on the local soap opera, Indian Premier League, wasn’t ready for the biggest stage just yet. Surely, by the time the next big show comes around, he will be in the spotlight. Scriptwriter Virat Kohli was excellent but still did not meet his lofty standards and fluffed the ending. Cameos from Sir Ravindra Jadeja grabbed bits and pieces of the public imagination and an unexpected starring role during India’s final moments justified calls for his regular introduction to the set-up in the future. Abhijato SensarmaDespite the horrible thrashing in the semi-final, we performed above expectations. Six months ago I didn’t think we’d make it to the last four in some respects we got through because other sides failed to deliver.Mitchell Starc was our best performer. It was a shame he went AWOL in the last two matches. Alex Carey looked a class above most in his ball-striking and attitude. He was a real find. To play a great knock after being cleaned up by Jofra Archer really showed he has what it takes. The performances of Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis were really disappointing. The one innings where Maxwell looked really like to kick into gear was the one where Usman Khawaja ran him out horribly.The semi-final revealed all our weaknesses at once, which was a shame. Unfortunately our domestic one-day competition is now contained in a short period at the start of our season. It’s not enough for players to improve their skills in this format on the biggest international stage. Scott MeehanPakistan did well. Our performance would be viewed much more positively had we reached the semi-finals, but that’s how fine the margins are. The game against West Indies was very costly and some fans think the Sri Lanka washout was a missed opportunity. Although we have no one to blame but ourselves for not reaching the last four.After beating both the finalists in the group stage, it’s a shame we weren’t consistent enough elsewhere. We have a few special players coming through and they will surely help. Although fielding remains a problem. Awais AhmedWe were hot favourites to finish in the bottom two, yet finished sixth and may have qualified for the semis had we won our two washed-out matches. We have a bright talent in Avishka Fernando. In fact, we could have a fearsome batting unit in 2023. The bowling will be the real concern. We have to search hard for the next Malingas and Muralis. Malinga still has a role to play in four years’ time. We need his personality and experience in the team. And our former cricketers need to take part in building cricket from scratch. The current administration is useless. Akesh SamudithaIt took us four games to get a point on the board and we had to thank the English summer weather for that. South Africa paid the price for a terribly slow start, and highlights were few and far between. The AB De Villiers debate before the tournament obviously didn’t help.I’m hugely disappointed that we were so poor early on. The late wins against Sri Lanka and and Australia, were spoiled by the fact that there was so very little to play for. Wasting a successful 300+ run chase against Australia in a dead rubber hurts. Nils LouwAfter a great start to the tournament – beating South Africa and almost forcing a win against the Kiwis – the Tigers threatened to be the story of the World Cup, but it never quite happened. Instead the campaign ended in a whimper with damaging losses against both south Asian neighbours. The defeat to Pakistan was particularly disappointing given the historical context and the fact they were playing in front of a packed house at Lord’s. It was easily their worst performance of the tournament.In contrast, the stunning run chase against the Windies on the postage stamp-sized Taunton ground was the tournament highlight, reaching the target of 322 with such ease and with so many overs to spare. It gave fans genuine hope for a top-four finish. Had fine margins gone their way, a semi-final place would have been a reality.The team didn’t quite live up to its billing for the emotional Tiger fans. A feeling of the wheels coming off was compounded by the swift dismissal of coach Steve Rhodes long before England lifted the trophy.Giving player of the tournament to Kane Williamson was obviously a sympathy vote. Shakib Al Hasan was the true star of the World Cup. After spending a decade being the most underrated international cricketer in the most underrated international team, Shakib finally became a household name – for those households with Sky TV anyway. His consistency batting at No 3, often arriving at the crease early in the innings, and scoring at nearly a run a ball was staggering. Add to that tidy reliable off-spin and you have the complete package. Tawhid QureshiWe were terrible for most of it. Bowling Pakistan out for 105 in the first game got our hopes up, but there wasn’t enough thought into anything after that and we played out the tournament as a Chris Gayle testimonial tour. At least we beat a plucky Afghanistan side.The authorities must begin planning for the next World Cup immediately by investing in players who will be available solely for the longer version of the game. We have become champions of the T20 game, but the same players struggle in longer formats. T20 is hurting the quality of players in the longer versions. The problem remains that we have a very small pool of players. Glen DucreayIt was always going to be tough. Always. I’m disappointed we didn’t take any points but there were some competitive performances. Falling 11 runs short of beating India, and two balls from shocking Pakistan, were the best memories.Captain Mohammad Nabi had plenty to say before the tournament, but his inexperience showed in the field. I’ll be happy if we can progress tactically and learn from the experience of playing against the very best.

OK, we laughed about it then too – here are some of the most humiliating World Cup moments endured by the England men’s cricket team. In the 1987 World Cup final, they were doing so well that Allan Border brought himself on to bowl, which was, of course, the perfect moment for Mike Gatting to deploy his fabled reverse-sweep. In 1996, Neil Smith discharged his guts on to the pitch and then Sri Lanka knocked his team out in the quarter-finals, chasing down 236 with nearly 10 overs to spare. In 1999, the last time the competition was held in the green and pleasants, the opening ceremony had to be cut short because of rain and England were eliminated before the official song came out, dismissed for 103 by South Africa and 169 by India. Here they are in 2007, struggling to beat Canada in the aftermath of the Fredalo jaunt and here they are losing to Ireland in 2011, a moment greatly appreciated by the people of Pune. And, because we can’t help ourselves, a bit of 2019: the ICC’s montage of the staggering denouement.2) It’s that time of year again when we begin preparing for the World Chase Tag championships, to be held at London’s York Hall on 24 August.

The three-runner championship race of early July is now, barring unforeseen accidents, very much down to two.Murphy, who was a narrow favourite ahead of de Sousa at the start of the campaign in May, still heads the market on 4-6, but Tudhope, who has quietly built a five-winner lead at 71-66 before Thursday’s racing is now the rider he needs to worry about. Having been a 25-1 shot as recently as 25 June, Tudhope is now a 6-4 chance and if he can maintain his current strike-rate, it is only a matter of time before he replaces Murphy as the title favourite.The recent evidence is promising. On Wednesday, Tudhope went to Catterick for just three rides and came home in front on two. Laura Way, his agent, is also getting him aboard plenty of fancied runners, and Tudhope, in return, is doing the business. He rode 25 clear favourites in May and 18 in June, but he has already been aboard 23 so far in July and won on 14, well above the market’s expectation based on their SPs.Days like this could make all the difference in the end, however. Tudhope has four rides at Hamilton, where Point Of Order (1.40) is his best chance of a winner in the opening race. Murphy, though, has six across two cards including three favourites, one of which – Above in the 3.00 at Chepstow – is certain to start at odds-on. Murphy’s rides at Epsom later on include Allegiant (7.10), who is definitely worth backing at around 2-1 in the 10-furlong handicap. Dutch Coed (3.10) could offer some value at around 4-1 against the Tudhope-ridden Bellepower at Hamilton, where Retirement Beckons (4.40) should also run well.The best best of the day, though, could be Sauchiehall Street (4.50) in the 12-furlong handicap at Leicester. He did not get home over two miles on his latest start but travelled well for much of the way and is currently sitting on a turf mark that is nearly a stone below his all-weather rating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a54300d0f6f3337362901d1320e8b6d518aa6c4/0_10_2752_1651/master/2752.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f30fb2788619f090563898904db1d565 1760w","title":"england v australia womens ashes test first day live","story":"The players are back on the field. Always start a session with your best bowlers, so Katherine Brunt it is from the River End. Bowling to Perry. PLAY! “Afternoon Adam, afternoon everyone.” Hello Harkarn Sumal. “Is it okay that I’m frankly terrified by Jess Jonassen being listed to come in a number 9? The Australian batting order is monstrous. That power, the clean hitting, the uncomplicated, clean (but not slogging), simple techniques that they have all down their middle and lower-middle order, that’s where this game is likely to be set up and taken beyond England’s reach over two innings. It also probably gives the top order that confidence to go about their work positively without worrying that what’s to come behind them will fold. There seems so little in the Australian batting set-up, trigger movements and technique that can go awry. It clears the way for players to concentrate on judgement. I have a lot of fear. I can feel the fear. Also, it’s already ragging for our orthodox spinners – heaven knows what it’ll be doing by Sunday. At least Australia doesn’t have a leggie in this side (am I right in thinking the spin options are all orthodox?). I’m sure you try to be neutral when OBO-ing, but you must be so delighted to have this side represent Australia. As Rachael Haynes intimated recently when asked whether women should play more test cricket, the rest of the world has some catching up to do I fear. Yours with growing concern.”You are right about the depth of Australia’s batting. Jonassen’s 99 on Test debut last time around four years ago was a bit of an outlier, in that, she struggled to make a run in the years since. However, during the ODIs of this comp she was outstanding. England agrees with her with both the ball and the bat. In terms of more Test cricket, take a look at Megan Schutt’s piece overnight. Healy dominant England hold their nerve. Striking 12 boundaries in her 58, Healy looked like she was on the cusp of doing something special. But England’s new spinner Sophie Gordon found her range and after creating a couple of chances against Lanning, slipped by the opener’s front pad with a straight one. The Australian captain should have followed her but Knight put her down just before lunch at extra cover. That could be costly in the context of what will more than likely be a low-scoring affair. Brunt was into the action early as well, castling Bolton (6), who was the first to fall. Between times, Ecclestone left the field in tears after landing heavily on her right shoulder, but the spinner is expected to bowl after lunch having returned following 20 minutes of treatment. I’ll also be back with you for that middle session in about half an hour. I’ll drop back in here after I’ve had a bite to eat. How are you enjoying this first day? Where are you watching from? Ping me a line. 30th over: Australia 106-2 (Lanning 27, Perry 10) Lanning gets off strike first ball, which is advisable in the final over before lunch. Perry enjoys the full toss that follows, smashing her over mid-off for another easy boundary before taking one to mid-off that gives Lanning three balls to negotiate. She does so well, getting forward to play out the final deliveries of a most eventful session. 29th over: Australia 100-2 (Lanning 26, Perry 5) Not a lot going on at Marsh’s end, Perry timing her behind in classic Perry fashion to bring up Australia’s 100. Back to Gordon. Can she create another chance before they break for lunch? 28th over: Australia 96-2 (Lanning 26, Perry 1) KNIGHT DROPS LANNING! Oh, she’ll be gutted with that. Gordon won the false stroke, the England skipper putting down her opposing number at cover. It’s not a tough chance, to her left at waist heigh. She has such a good pair of hands too. What a moment that might be.27th over: Australia 95-2 (Lanning 26, Perry 1) Marsh races through at Lanning initially then Perry, who is off the mark with a push to midwicket. Back to the real quiz now, which is Sophie Gordon vs Meg Lanning.“As Steve Smith has shown us enough times in India,” writes Tuvic Tuslow, “the only way to stay ahead on a dustbowl is by being agressive. Yes, the opposition might need to drop you six times along the way to allow you to score one of the greatest centuries of all time, but the point remains: gather as many runs as you can, because soon enough you won’t have much time to get them on this pitch either ways.” Quite right. Healy has played the right way here - early runs will be vital.26th over: Australia 91-2 (Lanning 22, Perry 0) Perry gets forward to defend the one remaining delivery in the successful over. “A shout out to Cricket Scotland,” says Mel Jones on TV, “for developing Kirstie Gordon.” England should be able to get four more overs in before the lunch interval. Gordon has her first Test wicket and what a massive one it is, bowling Healy around her front pad! Not the most conventional dismissal, the opener missing a ball on her leg stump when shuffling across. The end of a fine innings but one that could have gone on to define this match had she been there for two more hours.25th over: Australia 91-1 (Healy 58, Lanning 22) With 25 minutes until lunch, veteran tweaker Laura Marsh gets her first chance, replacing Sciver at the River End. She wasn’t expected to play here but with the track so dry, the home side went with her as a third specialist spinning option. She’s too short to begin to the chagrin of Beaumont at short leg, Healy’s pull smashing into his hand. The opener keeps the strike with a rare single for her today, moving to 58 from 76 balls. 24th over: Australia 88-1 (Healy 56, Lanning 21) BIG SHOUT for lbw turned down! After twice going beyond Lanning’s outside edge in her previous over, Gordon beats her on the inside edge this time. Technology (which isn’t available to the players for review) confirms that it is another good decision, the ball sliding down the legside. There’s nearly a bat-pad from the next ball too the ball could easily have landed with Beaumont at short leg. But Lanning is savvy enough to put away a lesser delivery later in the set to let the pressure off, carving it off the back foot through cover. She’s into the 20s but Gordon is now very much in the game.23rd over: Australia 84-1 (Healy 56, Lanning 17) Sciver is following her pattern from the Canterbury ODI, finding her groove after some nervous early offerings, now making it tough to hit her off the square. Has an important role to play.Word from the England camp on Ecclestone is that she landed on right shoulder in that e - she is sore and bruised. Because it is an internal injury, she won’t be permitted to bowl for the time she was off the field, which was about 20 mintues. rwhen she ed. Sore and bruised. Internal injury so she can’t bowl for 22nd over: Australia 82-1 (Healy 55, Lanning 16) So close! Gordon sends down a beauty at Lanning, just beating her outside edge from around the wicket. There’s a loud noise so they are up in the appeal but it was bat on pad rather than ball. Good decision. The tweaker beats her again to finish with one that really turns off this first morning surface. In another piece of good news for England as the over comes to a close, Sophie Ecclestone is back on the field. They hosts need something.“’That is Healy’s first Test half-century.’” says OB Jato. “This statement literally defines everything wrong with women’s Test cricket right now!”21st over: Australia 81-1 (Healy 54, Lanning 16) Nice fightback from Sciver, who gives Lanning nothing and gets through a rare maiden. There’s a generous response for local Anya Shrubsole who makes a fine ing stop to her left at point.20th over: Australia 81-1 (Healy 54, Lanning 16) You can’t give Healy a full toss in this mood and you definitely can’t give her two in an over. After a tidy start from Gordon the young spinner loses here way here. Healy moves to 50 from 61 deliveries from the first of those bas balls, lifting her over midwicket for her 11th fours. That makes just six runs in non-boundaries on the opening morning of a Test. Have that. She takes the second fully over mid-on to make it 12. Easy peasy. 19th over: Australia 73-1 (Healy 46, Lanning 16) Sciver has to get into the game after a poor first couple of overs. Lanning takes her down the ground for a couple but the all-rounder then finds her mark. She was very good at Canterbury picking up Healy, Perry and Lanning, which is easy to forget given the carnage that ensued there after the lunch break. 18th over: Australia 71-1 (Healy 46, Lanning 14) Good start this from Gordon, who bowls with a bit of extra pace than Ecclestone from her lower trajectory. She’s good enough to locate Lanning’s inside edge, spitting out behind square. If Ecclestone is in strife, the Scotish import will have loads of work to do today. 17th over: Australia 69-1 (Healy 45, Lanning 13) Sciver is struggling but isn’t helped by Healy’s class, deflecting her perfectly down to third man for yet another boundary. She doesn’t help herself to finish, though, a half volley given the treatment by Lanning. These two are motoring, striking 40 runs in the ten overs they’ve been out there together, dealing almost exclusively in boundaries. 16th over: Australia 60-1 (Healy 40, Lanning 9) Lanning helped an Ecclestone full toss on its way before she went off. How often has a bowler sent down their first over in Test cricket completing the set of another? That’s what Gordon is tasked with doing, getting out of it with a nerveless four dots to the Aussie skipper. I’m afraid to report that Brunt is also hobbling around between overs, looking to favour that right ankle she hurt when celebrating a wicket at Leicester. Uh oh.Bowling through tears, Ecclestone is off the ground after two deliveries. The right arm is causing her an enormous amount of pain. Kirstie Gordon, on debut, will complete the over. Disastrous for England if they’ve lost their best spinner. 15th over: Australia 56-1 (Healy 40, Lanning 5) Good news: Ecclestone is staying out there. Four balls remaining in the Sciver over, on to replace Brunt, and she directs the first of those down the legside for four byes. Not good. Before the break, Healy already helped herself to a ninth boundary with that aforementioned clip past square leg. England have a real problem on their hands here.Two balls into the 15th over, drinks are called with Ecclestone getting looked at by the medical staff after ing unsucessfully to stop a Healy clip through square leg. She hit the deck and reached for her shoulder. She looks okay. Let’s hope so. 14th over: Australia 47-1 (Healy 36, Lanning 4) Ecclestone has found her range immediately, forcing Healy forward from the get-go. She beats her on the inside edge half way through the over prompting a loud lbw shout but from the bowler only. But missing her length to finish, Healy rocks back to cut another four. They go upstairs to confirm that Marsh didn’t keep it in, the fielder’s leg on the sponge. 13th over: Australia 43-1 (Healy 32, Lanning 4) Shot! After watching 14 dot balls, Meg Lanning gets off the mark with a beautifully timed push off the back foot, racing down to the rope for four. Otherwise, Brunt is right where she needs to be, asking the right questions of the Australian captain. 12th over: Australia 39-1 (Healy 32, Lanning 0) Excellent first over from Ecclestone, spin for the first time in the Test in this 12th over. The tall left-arm tweaker, who was so impressive in her Test debut at Sydney two years ago, beats Healy first up with a full delivery that did plenty, nicely pouched by Taylor. She’s giving it plenty of air, Healy defending the 20-year-old with full respect. She tries to score from the final delivery, uppishly to cover, but doesn’t beat the field. I’ve been arguing that Ecclestone is already the best spinner in the world. With England needing a win in this to stay alive, this is a huge four days for her.11th over: Australia 39-1 (Healy 32, Lanning 0) I tell you what, Healy is on century-in-a-session pace here, taking on Brunt given the slightest width, slapping her through backward point for seventh boundary. Ooooooh, Brunt bites back with a beauty later in the set, once again able to cut past the inside edge just over the woodwork. Healy finishes getting a long way forward to defend. Fantastic contest.10th over: Australia 34-1 (Healy 27, Lanning 0) Shrubsole to the rampaging Healy and she would have another boundary here if not for Gordon’s excellent ing stop at mid-off. The former Scotland international, on Test debut today, is a very impressive all-round cricketer. We’ll see her at the bowling crease very soon. 9th over: Australia 33-1 (Healy 26, Lanning 0) Brunt to Lanning is box office. It is quite remarkable that the Australian captain, the greatest batter of all time in the women’s 50-over format, averages 17 in her four Tests and has never reached 50. She’s leaving, leaving, leaving then defending here. When a ball arrives on leg stump to finish, she picks out midwicket. Maiden it is. England must get her early.“Proposal off the top of my head,” writes Abhijato Sensarma. “Authorities want T20s and women cricketers want Tests, while purists are most comfortable with the best of both worlds - ODIs. But why can’t we have the best of three worlds by combining all three formats together to create a new one? In the true spirit of Men’s WC knockouts, including the part of revenue-generation, have ‘Two Day Cricket’ ... On the first day, play 20 overs each return the next day, and play a further 20 overs each. Four innings, ten wickets per innings, and endless fun all long (until the ODI-esque limit of 80 overs is reached, of course)!”I like most out-of-the-box thinking but I’d rather than just gave them more Tests. 8th over: Australia 33-1 (Healy 26, Lanning 0) It doesn’t bother Healy that she has lost her opening partner, lashing the first ball of Shrubsole’s new over through cover for her fifth boundary. Oh, make that six! A gorgeous square drive the best of the lot so far. She’s 26 from 28 balls half an hour into a Test. As you do! The plan early on in any Test Match is to hit the top of off and that’s precisely what Brunt has done, shaping away just enough to evade the opener’s outside edge. Another single-digit return for the West Australian. And in walks Lanning.6th over: Australia 19-0 (Healy 17, Bolton 1) This is an excellent start from Healy, slapping a wider Shrubsole delivery with perfect timing over backward point for four. To finish, an even better shot along the carpet the other side of point for another boundary. 5th over: Australia 11-0 (Healy 9, Bolton 1) Shot. Healy said that she wouldn’t be curtailing her natural instints in Test cricket and it shows when Brunt goes short, the Australian taking her on with a punishing pull over midwicket. I like this elevation. If she’s there at tea, for instance, she’ll be well beyond 100. 4th over: Australia 6-0 (Healy 4, Bolton 1) Shrubsole is getting some lovely hoop early on, Bolton playing her very carefully. The Australian opener isn’t in great nick but she four years ago, when making her Test debut, got through some very tough sessions against the new ball from these two. 3rd over: Australia 6-0 (Healy 4, Bolton 1) Brunt is on top, giving Bolton little and winning an early play and miss. After getting off the mark with a single to cover it’s Healy’s turn, Brunt repeating the first ball of the match to finish, jagging back off the seam to again cut her in half. Dangerous start this from the Barnsley Express. 2nd over: Australia 5-0 (Healy 4, Bolton 0) Shrubsole running away from us at the pavilion end, Bolton defending and leaving studiously. Just as there was from the river end, the carry is there through to Sarah Taylor. The left-hander gets Australia off the mark via a leg bye, giving Healy one chance from the final ball of the over and she uses it well to drive a classy boundary through cover for four. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Healy 0, Bolton 0) Brunt cuts Healy in half with the first ball of the Test! A beauty, jagging back off the seam. The opener gets into her groove as the over continues, leaving and defending well. Nice carry from Brunt, which is encouraging. Two years ago, the two balls in Schutt’s first over didn’t make it through to the wicketkeeper the track was so dead. Fingers crossed. Oh, scrap that. Would you believe, there is a hole on the ground at backward point that the umpires want covered up by the groundsman. Odd. Try again: PLAY! Katherine Brunt has the ball in her hand. This will almost certainly be her final Test Match for England. What a warrior she has been. Healy is on strike. PLAY! Jerusalem is playing. The umpires are making their way to the middle, followed by Heather Knight and her team. The Australian openers, Nicole Bolton and Alyssa Healy, follow. The latter is at the top of the list for the first time in Test Match. Let’s be real: it is a dreadful toss to loss if this goes all Ciderabad. But at least England’s spinners already have something to work with out there.Australia go with an extra bat, leaving out the leggie Wareham. England are playing three specialist spinners, overlooking seamer Cross. Full XIs shortly. Actually, read this before the toss. Megan Schutt has views and isn’t afraid to voice them. Her latest column spells out why it is plainly wrong that only Australian and English women get to play Tests and how it isn’t fair that they only get to do so every other year. Crucially, she also comes with ideas for the future. Good morning from Taunton! We are roughly ten minutes from the toss and I come with news off the top. Three Australians are winning their baggy greens today: Ash Gardner, Tayla Vlaeminck and Sophie Molineux. For England, Amy Jones and Kirstie Gordon are set to make their Test Match bows. For the visitors, it was a brilliant touch having Dan Christian on deck to present Gardner with the famous cap. Of course, the two of them captained the teams that toured England last summer to mark 150 years since the trailblazing Indigenous Australians visited this country to play in 1868. Mitch Starc welcomed Vlaeminck, a fellow speedster, to the fold while Belinda Clark, the interim boss of high performance and former dominant skipper, gave the speech for Molineux. The latter, a big turner of the ball with her left-arm orthodox, will like the look of the pitch. There has been some debate as to what constitutes a used surface, but the facts are that it was last played on for the Afghanistan vs New Zealand World Cup game on 8 June. There are some very helpful footmarks on show outside the off-stump for left-handers at the River End. We’ll see how that all plays out. England do need a result well inside the four days with rain forecast tomorrow. A draw is enough for Australia to retain the trophy having swept the ODIs three-zip a couple of weeks ago, the third in spectacular fashion when Ellyse Perry took 722. I’ll be back with the formal teams and toss shortly. I’m looking forward to your company throughout the day - and week - in the usual way. Do drop me a line.

Having reached the front edge of the par-five 2nd, he sends a chip bouncing up the green, then biting and spinning slowly towards the hole. Almost as though the ball is on remote control. That’s a kick-in birdie, and he moves into red for the first time this week. The 2010 champ Louis Oosthuizen rattles in a 15-footer for his birdie, and he’s -1 too. And up on 3, Tommy Fleetwood cards his first birdie of the day with a 30-foot roller.Dylan Frittelli, who only secured his place here by winning the John Deere last week, makes his first bogey of the day on 18. Always a punch to the guts, but he’ll have taken a three-under 68 this morning. Fine par saves for McIlroy (+3) and Paul Casey (-1) at 11. But G-Mac misreads a short par putt on 15 to drop his first stroke of the day. He’s -2 again.Robert MacIntyre - with a couple of second-place finishes to his name on the European Tour this season - joins Lowry and Frittelli in the lead at -4! He rakes in a 30-footer on the 17th. Tommy Fleetwood misses a short birdie effort on 2, such a shame after an approach dialled in to six feet. And some breaking news on 12, where David Duval makes a par. His second in eight holes. Four bogeys. One quadruple. One octuple. Oh David! “Are we officially on Sergio Watch yet?” wonders Hubert O’Hearn. “Be a fine thing for a fine young Irish lad like Sergy O’Garcia to win on our moss-covered Open. I’m trusting on our weather to douse the course overnight at least twice over the next three days (safest prediction I’ve ever made) to keep the fire out of the greens so our man can give putts a good old whack instead of the tiddlers and topplers that make his fingers twitch. Slainte Sergio!”Brooks Koepka is out and about. The reigning PGA champion pars the opening hole without too much fuss, but it doesn’t look as though he’s going to enjoy the best of the weather. It is positively pelting down now.Eagle-eyed readers will have noticed that Kevin Kisner has slipped off the leader board. That’s the result of wanging his approach at 9 into a bush and running up a double bogey. He still turns in 34, mind you, sitting nicely at -2. But some harder holes to follow.A miserable end to the round for Webb Simpson. A weak chip from a tight lie to the side of 17 cost him one shot, then another goes down the last. Still, he’s back in the hut with a fine 68. His playing partner Sergio also signs for a 68, and looks very happy with his lot as well. His mood may augur well for the rest of the week. Can he put the demons of 2007 and 2014 behind him? It’d be lovely to see, especially as he’s done bugger all in the majors since slipping on that green jacket a couple of years ago.Thanks David. Now then, before I get back to business, a word on David Duval. You may remember his eight at the 5th. Well, he’s followed that up with a 13 (!) at 7. Details are a little sketchy, but it would seem he ended up hitting such a bad provisional off the tee that a second was required ... and then he played the wrong one. For a while, he was reported to have run up 15 on the hole, but that’s been revised down by the match referee. Just a octuple bogey, then! By way of comparison, the biggest number on Maurice Flitcroft’s infamous card of 121 in the 1976 qualifiers was a 12 (though to be fair, there was a question mark beside that one). Anyway, the former champ has since dropped another couple of strokes, and is currently +13 through 10. Conclusive proof, if you required it, that 2001 is an awfully long time ago.Another birdie for Rory McIlroy, this time at 9. That’s two birdies in three holes and +3 after 9 means his outward score could be downgraded from disastrous to disappointing. Is he back in the game? I’ll hand back to Scott Murray to guide you through Rory’s back nine.An Irishman, who teed off this morning, leads the Open at Royal Portrush. Nope, not Rory McIlroy but Clara native Shane Lowry. An excellent 4-under 67 is two better than the early target posted by Frenchman Romain Langasque. Lowry has missed his last four Open cuts which comes as a surprise. On each occasion, a slow start has undermined his challenge and today’s 67 is his lowest round-one score in eight appearances. The last time Lowry shot in the 60s at an Open he took tied ninth at Royal Liverpool so this could prove an excellent foundation.Shane Lowry’s strong opening round is almost at conclusion. It’s been an excellent morning’s work from the Irishman but he’s just fighting his swing a little as the finishing line approaches. A rather weary Lowry gives it the big lean as his approach to 18 soars towards the green and his body language gives it away. Short, right and into a greenside bunker. An up and down will give him a 67 and the new clubhouse lead of 4-under.Fun fact: Rory McIlroy’s caddie, Harry Diamond, played in the 2012 Irish Open held at Portrush. He missed the cut after rounds of 77-74 although did beat several well-known names, including 2005 US Open champion Michael Campbell and European Tour winners George Coetzee and Scott Jamieson. Meanwhile, his boss (and childhood buddy) Rory just misses a curling 20-foot birdie effort at 8. Shame. That would have been back-to-back gains and perhaps the start of a move. McIlroy remains tied 79th and nine back from leader Webb Simpson.The last six golfers to have a piece of the first-round lead at an Open were all Americans. And generally elite ones at that - Kevin Kisner, Jordan Spieth, Matt Kuchar, Brooks Koepka, Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson. Webb Simpson is upholding that tradition and rolls in a six-foot putt at 15 to stay one clear. Ten pars, five birdies and -5 with three to play.Birdie for Rory. A first red number of the day for the local hero and just a little spring in his step as he walks off the side of the 7th green after rolling in an eight-footer on the second of the front nine’s par 5s. A positive take is that he’s played his last six holes in even-par following the quadruple-bogey horror show at the first hole. Some context of his performance so far is provided by the bookmakers. Before his first shot, Rory traded at 81. When he faced further ruin at the fifth, McIlroy touched 661. Following the birdie at 7, he’s a more cautious 281.Fake news. One early press tent rumour was that Alex Noren was playing poorly in practice. Not a big surprise given his somewhat indifferent form this season. That said, whilst getting a thorough drenching when walking the course yesterday afternoon, I stumbled upon the Swede and saw him play a wonderful approach to the tough 11th for what would have been a kick-in birdie. A birdie at that very same hole today has helped ignite an early challenge and he’s still one of the early pacesetters at -3 after 15.Let’s talk about Henrik Stenson. The man who epitomises Swedish cool is a likely contender this week having won at Royal Troon in 2016 and accumulated a trio of other top three Open finishes. He warmed up with a top four in last week’s Scottish Open and has reached the turn here in 1-under, strolling off the green after a par at 9. Current status: lurking.The PGA Tour’s John Deere Classic would seem a strange way to prepare for an Open. It’s played on a parkland course in nice weather and requires an absurd about of birdies if you want to win it. And yet, two of the last four Open winners - Zach Johnson (2015) and Francesco Molinari (2018) - had used it as their Open warm-up. Last week’s John Deere was won by South African Dylan Frittelli with 21-under and, lo and behold, he’s upholding the curious John Deere-Open link with a fast start here, moving to 3-under after 12 and just two off the lead.Rory’s hole scores so far: 8-5-4-4-4-3. Well, at least the trend is going in the right direction. Not sure he can make a 2 on the par-5 7th mind but it does represent a good chance to finally get a birdie on the board. If it’s any consolation (it isn’t), he’s not the only former Open champion to have put a ‘snowman’ on his card today. David Duval, the 2001 Lytham champion, was bowling along nicely after a birdie-birdie start but then followed a pair of bogeys with an eight at the fifth. Back at the top, fellow major winner Webb Simpson is the first man to hit -5 after a birdie at 13. He leads by one.Here comes Sergio! Garcia, he of 10 Open top 10s, bursts into tied fourth spot after a birdie at 12, the final of the three par 5s at Royal Portrush.I’ve just stuck my head outside the media centre and the wind is picking up. Nothing too severe yet but trousers are flapping and comb-overs starting to stand tall. Grey clouds are lurking but no sign of a downpour yet. So, a WGC winner, a Wentworth winner and a US Open winner share the lead at -4. That’s Lowry, Noren and Simpson. As for Rory, some good news at last. His ball is found and he gets a serious break with a line-of-sight drop thanks to the scoreboard. He hacks on to the green and actually has a putt for birdie which doesn’t drop but a further crisis avoided. Then again, +5 after 5 is not good, unless you like nice symmetry.Webb Simpson is hot, hot, hot. It’s now four birdies in five holes, the latest at 11, and he joins the leaders at -4. Alex Noren is now one of those lads, having followed up birdie at 11 with another at 12. Kevin Kisner is going along nicely, too, with eagle at 2 and birdie at 4. And big-hitting Luke List makes good use of his distance with eagle at 2. Here’s the always evolving leaderboard as it stands ...... and with that, I’m off for a little break. David Tindall will be your guide until I next see you. Anon!A fair chance that McIlroy has lost his ball on 5. He sends a huge slice off towards some mutant curly kale down the right. It disappears into the verdant nonsense. Problem is, the stewards were looking for Paul Casey’s tee shot at the time, which was terrible enough but not quite so awful, and so they didn’t see where McIlroy’s effort landed. God speed, Rory. Just as well for the home crowds that G-Mac is going along nicely: birdie at 7 to follow the shot he’d picked up at 2, and he’s -2.Par for Darren Clarke down the last. And the man who took the first stroke this morning is the first man back in the clubhouse. A fine 71. The Amateur Champion James Sugrue also signs for a 71. Both men get a rousing reception from the Portrush punters. And the third member of the opening group, Charley Hoffman, departs with a 70. All three will be a little disappointed right now, having bogeyed 16 and 17, dragging each other down. But all three would have taken those cards in the morning, surely.It’s all change at the top yet again. Bogey for MacIntyre at 9, and he’s replaced at -4 by Lowry, who bounces back with birdie at 12, rolling in a fine 15-footer. Birdies for Pepperell - at 13, his third in four holes - and Noren, at 11, fatten up the group in second place.Phil Mickelson’s hopes of a second Open Championship look as slim as his all-new waistline. Bogeys at 9 and now 11 have furthered his fall down the leaderboard he’s +3. Here, can you picture that police car (9.06am) bobbing off towards Islay, atop some foamy waves, a confused Phil in the passenger seat trying to read an upside-down map, red-faced Rory at the wheel tapping frantically into the sat-nav? Yes, me too.More bad luck for the Irish. Lowry’s always out of position coming down 11. He very nearly drains a 30-footer for par, but that’s his first bogey of the day, and he drops out of the lead. Clarke meanwhile makes a second bogey in as many holes, this time at 17. He old boy’s tired since his hot start over the first five holes. Five bogeys and just two birdies since then. He’s back to level par and struggling to hold a brave smile for the gallery. Belated news of Romain Langasque, who birdied 12. He takes Xander Schauffele’s spot at -3, the Californian having bogeyed 6 to slip back to -2. And he’s passed by Webb Simpson going the other way: his third birdie in four holes, at 10, takes the North Carolinian to -3.McIlroy was five over after the first six holes at Birkdale in 2017, yet still finished the week in a tie for fourth. He’ll have to pull something similar out of the bag if he’s to have any hope whatsoever this week, because his chip up onto the green only just fails to topple back down the bank. He’s left with a 15-footer for par, and a bobbly effort stops just short. He’s +5 after three. He’s beaten his previous worst start in double-quick time.It’s no longer breaking news, but Rory McIlroy is having an absolute shocker. He’s just sent his tee shot at the par-three 3rd into the lush grass at the back of the green. Up and down for par’s not a pipe dream, but even so, this is awful to watch. A man crumbling to dust under the leaden weight of expectation. “You say Darren Clarke would become the oldest major winner at age 50 were he to win on Sunday, but I think you’ll find that Tom Watson was 59 when he won the Open at Turnberry in 2009. At least that’s how I remember it. Just like I remember Scotland winning the World Cup in 1978, Dundee United the European Cup in 1984, and Colin Montgomerie the US Open in 2006.” Simon McMahon, there, speaking from a parallel universe for so many of us.It’s been an eventful back nine for Darren Clarke. Having bogeyed 14, he followed up with birdie at 15 and now bogey at 16. He’s still in good nick at -1 though. Molinari, having birdied 2, retains his momentum by rolling in a missable par putt on 3. He stays at -1. His partner Scott, having doubled 2, regains some positivity by raking in a long birdie putt on 3. He’s back to +1.An eventful par for the new US Open champion Gary Woodland at 2. He whiffs a wedge from thick greenside nonsense, then clips his second attempt to kick-in distance. He’s level par. His partner Paul Casey has also started par-par. And the third member of the group, Rory McIlroy, sets himself up for a birdie attempt that would give him some desperately required succour. But there’s no bounce-back joy as he tugs a horrible putt wide left from six feet. He’s all over the shop, his mind scrambled, poached and Ulster fried.A huge break for McIlroy on 2, as he lets go of the club on his follow-through while lashing out of the rough. His ball squirts between a couple of fairway bunkers and scampers forward. A chance now to get up and down for a restorative birdie. All the way up the other end of the leaderboard - the pre-tournament favourite McIlroy is currently 60th out of 61 - Lowry birdies 10 and MacIntyre birdies 4. Schauffele keeps on their tail with birdie at 5. So with Hoffman bogeying 16 and Noren dropping one at 9, there’s suddenly some separation at the top!Another fast start for a Scottish star, as Russell Knox follows birdie at 2 with another at 4. He’s -2, alongside Sergio, who after a long string of pars has carded back-to-back birdies at 7 and 8. The rejuvenated 2012 US Open and 2018 Players champion Webb Simpson, playing alongside Garcia, does exactly the same. He’s -2 as well. And on 2, Rory McIlroy, facing up to another year without a major, sends his drive at the par-five 2nd into the thicker rough down the right. The noggin gone. But he’s not alone, because up on the green, Adam Scott makes a double-bogey seven and slips to +2.McIlroy was in deep bracken. So he’s forced to take an unplayable. This is a complete fiasco. He lobs his sixth shot up onto the green, and he’s left with a six-footer. He can’t make it. An opening quadruple-bogey eight. The gallery is stunned into near silence. The expectation too much. Meanwhile birdies for Charley Hoffman at 15, Shane Lowry at 9, and Alex Noren at 8. They all join MacIntyre at -3. McIlroy seven off the lead having played one hole of golf.Yep, McIlroy’s first shot was out of bounds. A disastrous start. The sort of thing Tiger has made a habit of doing at the Open over the years, so in that sense it’s a good omen. But it isn’t good, is it. And things continue to unravel as, taking his fourth stroke from the rough down the left, he allows the thick grass to wrap around the hosel. He sends his ball whistling into even thicker nonsense to the left of the green. He’ll do well to make a triple bogey from here. Dear lord.Here comes Rory. And he might have flayed his opening drive out of bounds down the left. He furrows his brow and mutters the eff-word with great passion and some added feeling. Uh-oh. He’s forced to hit a provisional, and that one goes into the thick rough down the same side too. At least that one’s definitely still on the course.Grillo creams an iron into the 200-yard par-three 13th. The ball bounces off the shoulder of a bunker to the left of the green, and is gathered towards the hole by the camber. It rolls gently towards the cup, one of those that you just know is always going in. So satisfying to watch. Grillo - who has also carded a triple bogey today - grins broadly as he flings a dappled souvenir into the crowd. He’s level par for his work so far. His postman has some work to do after all!Someone finally breaks clear of the pack at -2! It’s the 22-year-old Scot Robert MacIntyre, whose drive at the short par-four 5th finds the fringe. He rolls home a monster eagle putt and ... well, it’s way too early of course, but it’s the 20-year anniversary of the last Scottish winner of the Open. Anyone who fancies a wander down memory lane could do a lot worse than reading this marvellous piece by Elizabeth Nelson of the Ringer.The defending champion Francesco Molinari takes to the first tee. A huge roar of respect - and great fondness - greets the popular Ryder Cup hero, the first Italian to have lifted the Claret Jug. The first shot of his title defence slips just off the left of the fairway, but that’s decent enough. He’s going round with Bryson DeChambeau and 2012’s nearly man Adam Scott. Both find the fairway with their irons. Few would begrudge Scott victory this week, after his heartache at Lytham back in the day, throwing away the title with four bogeys in the last four holes. He’s apparently been playing very well in practice, so perhaps redemption awaits. After Ben Stokes last weekend at Lord’s, perhaps something’s in the air?It seems like half of the field are at -2. Charley Hoffman joins the gang with birdie at 13. His playing partner Darren Clarke had a good chance to grab the lead for himself after sending his tee shot at the par-three to six feet, but he tugs nervously at the putt and has to make do for a par that keeps him at -2."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7576baf764debcf61cc0c81f09b75c1a61702a/0_81_3079_1848/master/3079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8408d2b125ce6cc4479345554f02e1bf","title":"tour de france 2019 stage 12 live","story":"Name that breakaway: “The Sagan Agreement,” writes Tim Smith. I like that one. An email: “Let me be the first (one) of 458 pedants to tell you that you shouldn’t put your bike upside down for maintenance,” writes Daniel Roßbach. Fair enough Daniel, although I would argue that simply peering at and gently poking a derailleur does not exactly qualify as “maintenance”. Abandonment: Having taken a heavy fall yesterday, Team Dimension Data rider Giacomo Nizzolo has been struggling at the back all day today. He has finally decided enough is enough, summoned his team car, stepped off his bike and removed his race number.Following the controversial decision to drop Mark Cavendish from this year’s Tour line-up, the Dimension Data sprinter who was called up to replace him has been forced out of the race through injury. 89.5km to go: “Don’t you think the Tour would be more exciting if the riders didn’t have radios?” asks Alan Cooper. “It would force riders to think for themselves more, and the potential for confusion would make every stage more interesting. I’m all for chaos in sports!” I wouldn’t disagree with that. 97km to go: Before the riders hit the intermediate sprint and subsequent big climbs, I’m going to roll through the feed zone. Back in 10. An email: “Now that the cycling has returned to its true procession form whilst you are live-reporting, is this an opportune time to give us an update on how your cycling exploits have gone since last week?” asks John O’G.It probably is, John. Having discovered last week that I probably need to get my gears “indexed”, I have gone into the spare room, turned the bike upside-down, peered intently at what I believe is known as the derailleur and poked at it a bit. Small steps, eh? One of the best bike shops in London - if not the world - is a 10-minute walk from my home, so once I get my own ass into gear, I’ll take my machine down there and get it into gear. Everyone’s a critic: “My new favourite expression is the clam before the storm,” writes Lizz Poulter, referring to my entry at 117km to go. 110km to go: Bora Hansgrohe rider Daniel Oss is doing most of the donkey work at the front of the breakaway, with UAE Team Emirates rider UAE Team Emirates on his wheel. The gap is 4min 07sec. 117km to go: Following today’s seriously frenetic start, the race has settled and we’re in the clam before today’s inevitable storm. The gap from the 40-man breakaway to the peloton is 4min 14sec. Name that breakaway: “I think Kevin Davey was mistakenly naming the 120 odd riders in the peloton as the Chelsea FC players out on loan, not the 40 in the breakaway,” writes Paul Fox. Jasper Philipsen The Belgian rider did not sign on for today’s stage and it has emerged that while he is not injured or ill, his UAE-Team Emirates overlords simply decided that doing half of the Tour was enough for the 21-year-old. He’ll benefit from the experience, without having to bury himself as the race hits the mountains. Name that breakaway: “The Brexit Party MEPs?” suggests John Cox. “Too soon?|Name that breakaway: “Not sure you’re doing this with such an enormous group, but the breakaway is all of the Chelsea FC’s players who are currently out on loan,” writes Kevin Davey. 134km to go: Our 40 (forty) man-breakaway has opened a gap of 3min 12sec on the bunch, where all the main GC contenders are safely ensconced. They’re being towed along by Julian Alaphilippe’s Deuceuninck-Quick Step team, who are keeping the gap down. Perhaps the winner won’t come from the breakaway after all ... 145km to go: Tim Wellens adds another point to his King of the Mountains collection as first man over the Category 4 Cote de Montoulieu-Saint-Bernard. WIth the race finally settled down, I’m off to grab a coffee. Back in five or so. Correction: Dan Martin is not in the breakaway, as originally (and erroneously) stated. 151km to go: The gap is 3min 21sec and such is the quality of many of the riders in our breakaway that our stage winner is certain to come from it. Behind them, the GC contenders will be providing a fascinating “second” race of the day when they hit the lumpy stuff. 152km to go: An official census has been taken and there are 40 men in today’s breakaway. They are ... Peter Sagan, Gregor Mühlberger, Daniel Oss and Max Schachmann (Bora-Hansgrohe), Michael Morkov (Deceuninck-Quick Step), Oliver Naesen, Tony Gallopin and Matthias Fränk (Ag2r La Mondiale), Sonny Colbrelli, Iván García Cortina and Dylan Teuns (Bahrain-Merida), Imanol Erviti (Movistar Team), Pello Bilbao (Astana), Dylan Groenewegen and Mike Teunissen (Jumbo-Visma), Alberto Bettiol, Simon Clarke and Tom Scully (EF Education First), Matteo Trentin and Simon Yates (Mitchelton-Scott), Greg Van Avermaet and Serge Pauwels (CCC Team), Rui Costa and Alexander Kristoff (UAE Team Emirates), Fabio Felline and Jasper Stuyven (Trek-Segafredo), Michael Matthews, Nikias Arndt, Cees Bol and Nicolas Roche (Team Sunweb), Pierre-Luc Périchon and Julien Simon (Cofidis), Tiesj Benoot, Roger Kluge and Tim Wellens (Lotto-Soudal), Lilian Calmejane (Total Direct Energie), Andrea Pasqualon (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Edvald Boasson Hagen and Michael Valgren (Dimension Data) and Kévin Lédanois (Arkéa-Samsic).156km to go: Peter Sagan has gone a few seconds clear of the breakaway group and seems very perky today. His Bora Hansgrohe team, Sunweb and AG2R have four riders each in the breakaway. Team Ineos, Groupama-FDJ and Katusha-Alpecin are the only three teams not represented. Ineos won’t care, while the other two teams just seem to have missed it. 160km to go: Michael Matthews, Alexander Kristoff, Sonny Colbrelli, Matteo Trentin, Peter Sagan and Dylan Groenewegen are among the cream of the sprinting talent in the breakaway, while there are plenty of good climbers alongside them, including Dan Martin, Nicolas Roche, Simon Yates and Tim Wellens, in his polka dot jersey. 164km to go: The escape party has been let go and they have opened a gap of 1min 52sec. It’s an enormous breakaway, comprising 42 riders. Dan Martin is in it, Nicolas Roche is there. Peter Sagan and Michael Matthews are present. Greg van Avermaet is the best placed escapee on GC, in 28th position at 14min 25sec. 166km to go: A group of about 40 riders get away and Team Ineos form a barrier across the the front of the peloton. They’ll be eager to find out who is in the escape party, just in case there’s anyone they need to worry about and chase down. Crikey! The riders have been barreling along at an average speed of more than 50km per hour since racing commenced. The intermediate sprint is 78 kilometres from the finish of today’s stage, just before the riders take on the Category 1 Col De Peyresourde. There are 167km to go in this stage and a breakaway has yet to be formed. 172km to go: “A lot of riders have made a lot of effort here and they’re going to be feeling it,” says Sean Kelly on Eurosport, as Thomas De Gendt puts the hammer down at the front of the bunch in the latest escape bid. The Australian team had a slightly tougher time than expected on a largely uneventful day. 180km to go: With almost 30 kilometres behind them, the riders have yet to settle. Bora Hangrohe’s Max Schachmann goes on the attack again and is joined by Mitchelton Scott’s Matteo Trentin and several others. Their efforts, like those of all before them, come to naught. 181km to go: Lennard Kamna (Sunweb) puts some distance between himself and the bunch and is joined by Pello Bilbao (Astana) and two others. The peloton are not having it and shut down the attack. 188km to go: Sagan is still out in front, but only leads by a couple of seconds. He looks around, wondering why nobody is joining him, then shakes his head as the the bunch catches him. Or he lets them catch him. 191km to go: The peloton continues to motor along, with the green, yellow and polka-dot jerseys all prominent near the front. The green won, covering the torso of Peter Sagan, shoots out of the pack again, the man occupying it looking behind him to see if anyone is up for joining him. There are no volunteers, but his knees keep pumping. 195km to go: The latest breakaway attempt is caught and this stage has yet to settle. 198km to go: A group of six riders launch an escape attempt, including Bora Hansgrohe’s Daniel Oss and Max Schachmann. They’re pedalling at a ferocious lick, but have yet to get away. 199km to go: The peloton put an abrupt stop to Caruso’s gallop and the bunch is back together again. No breakaway formed yet. 202km to go: The peloton reels in Sagan and his cronies, prompting Bahrain–Merida rider Damiano Caruso to attack off the front off the bunch. 204km to go: Peter Sagan attacks off the front of the bunch and is joined by three other riders, but behind them, the peloton is keeping them on a very tight rein. They’re racing in stage 12: Christian Prudhomme sends them on their way with an extravagant wave of his yellow flag. Thomas De Gendt, Edvald Boasson Hagen are among no end of riders who appear interested in getting in a breakaway, but with so much at stake nobody is being allowed to escape. “Stay around the front and just be there when a good group of riders tries to get away.” says Eurosport co-comms man Sean Kelly, who says every team will want somebody in the breakaway, whenever it forms. More withdrawals: Suffering from illness, Rick Zabel from Katusha-Alpecin did not start yesterday’s stage, while Total Direct Energie’s Niki Terpstra was forced to abandon after suffering a double fracture of his shoulder with 30 kilometres to go in yesterday’s stage. UAE team Emirates rider Philipsen Jasper did not start this morning. With eight men gone over 11 stages, the field has been reduced from 176 riders to 168. Christian Prudhomme on today’s stage: “The Pyrenean part of the Tour will start in the valley and that should motivate the usual breakaway suspects to give it a go but it’ll carry on with climbs up Peyresourde and La Hourquette d’Ancizan,” says the race director. “Only the best climbers among them will be in a position to triumph as they head down to Bagnères-de-Bigorre.”Currently leading the peloton along in his red Skoda, Prudhomme will give the signal to start racing once the riders have covered another five kilometres or so. “”It’s going to be frantic from the start,” muses Eurosport commentator Carlton Kirby. The roll-out has begun: The riders are currently wending their way through the streets of Toulouse, with aerial shots showcasing the picturesque terracotta slates and bricks from which many of the locale’s buildings are constructed. The Pink City, they call it and it’s not difficult to see why. Australia’s Caleb Ewan silenced a few doubters as he entered the pantheon of great sprinters able to combine technical ability and raw speed in a cauldron of pressureFrom William Fotheringham’s stage-by-stage guide: A relatively gentle introduction to the Pyrenees: two first category climbs with long run-in to the opener, the Col de Peyresourde. There is 130km for the break to build a lead so expect someone from the early move to win the overall contenders may well end up watching each other for signs of weakness over the Peyresourde and Hourquette d’Ancizan while saving strength for the coming days. Not the toughest mountain climbing, so the stage winner could be a breakaway specialist who isn’t one of the very best climbers. Britain’s Steve Cummings could be one to watch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1af502c0384996195ffefaec98de1ccb576841d/6_0_1068_641/master/1068.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e22e0346651857fc7c8e19b59d833718","title":"faceapp denies storing users photographs without permission","story":"App was launched by Russian developer in 2017 and uses AI to change people’s featuresThe developer of a popular app which transforms users’ faces to predict how they will look as older people has insisted they are not accessing users’ photographs without permission.FaceApp, which was launched by a Russian developer in 2017, uses artificial intelligence allowing people to see how they would look with different hair colour, eye colour or as a different gender.The app has topped download charts again this week, after users homed in on its ageing filter, which has since been used by dozens of celebrities and prominent figures to picture how they will supposedly look in several decades’ time.This surge of interest has in turn created concerns that FaceApp is systematically harvesting users’ images. People who upload their image to the app transfer the picture to a server controlled by the developer, with the photograph processing done remotely, rather than on their phone.These concerns have been heightened by growing awareness of online privacy issues in recent years and the fact that the developer is based in Russia, where many high-profile online misinformation campaigns have been based, in addition to a loosely-phrased privacy policy.In the US, senior Democrat Chuck Schumer has urged the FBI to investigate, saying FaceApp could pose “national security and privacy risks for millions of US citizens”, according to a letter seen by Associated Press. He said it would be “deeply troubling” if sensitive personal information was provided “to a hostile foreign power actively engaged in cyber hostilities against the United States”.The FaceApp CEO, Yaroslav Goncharov, said only a single picture specifically chosen by the user would be uploaded from a phone and the app did not harvest a user’s entire photo library, a claim backed by security researchers.He said the data was never transferred to Russia and was instead stored on US-controlled cloud computing services provided by Amazon and Google. “FaceApp performs most of the photo processing in the cloud. We only upload a photo selected by a user for editing. We never transfer any other images from the phone to the cloud.”The developer insisted that users had the right to request for their photographs to be removed from the server. “We might store an uploaded picture in the cloud. The main reason for that is performance and traffic: we want to make sure that the user doesn’t upload the photo repeatedly for every edit operation. Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date.”Goncharov said his company did not sell or share any user data with any third parties, and that most features were available without logging in – meaning the app does not have a large amount of data it can sell on inidual users.However, users ultimately have to rely on the word of the developer that the images are being removed from the system.FaceApp’s has previously received attention for the ethics of some of its filters. In April 2017 the app’s makers apologised for a feature that whitened people’s faces when they selected the “hot” filter, leading to accusations that it considered lighter skin to be synonymous with attractiveness. The developers said this was due to a flaw in the underlying neural network, which was skewed towards Caucasian faces.Later that year the app pulled a different filter which allowed users to see how they would look if they were a different race, after it was accused of promoting “digital blackface”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aec97e9e3d06571577d025708275647326617b56/0_2761_2320_1390/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70a4f392b0a7337c58c0b1c3dea4ba40","title":"whats the best mini laptop for youtube and writing reports","story":"Peter wants a mini-laptop to go with his old BlackBerry phone. What are his options? I’m old-school now at 71, but I’m still designing and working as a consultant. I had nothing but BlackBerry smartphones for years. Then it all went wrong. My boring Samsung J-something does most things but I miss my BlackBerry. I found an old one in a drawer, and it fits nicely in my pocket when off out. However, when I’m in a coffee place or relaxing, I’d like a big screen for YouTube, WhatsApp links, and writing reports. I’m thinking of rebooting my nice small BlackBerry and putting a smallish mini-laptop in my bag. Any thoughts? PeterBlackBerry lost its premier position in the market – when its phones were used by everyone from Paris Hilton to then US president Barack Obama – but you can still buy BlackBerry phones. The company licensed its name and technology to China’s TCL Communication Technology Holdings Limited (TCT), which sells phones under the TCL, BlackBerry Mobile and Alcatel brand names. It also makes TV sets, soundbars, headphones, air conditioners and dehumidifiers. (The BlackBerry name has also been used by Optiemus Infracom, selling phones as BlackBerry Mobile India, and BB Merah Putih, which briefly served the Indonesian market.)In 2013, BlackBerry tried to replace its original operating system with a new version, BlackBerry 10, based on the QNX operating system it bought in 2010. This is used in the BlackBerry Classic and BlackBerry Passport smartphones. However, in 2015, it started to move to Google Android with the Priv and DTEK50 models.You can still buy BlackBerry Mobile phones in the UK, including ones with physical keyboards, but they all run Android. While they have security and other features that could appeal to businesses, consumers can buy faster Android phones with bigger screens for less money.In the good old days, many of us carried Palm and Compaq iPaq PDAs (personal digital assistants) that enabled us to work on the move. The Psion Series 5 was a classic because it had such a good keyboard. The last one I had was, I think, an HP Jornada 720 with a 6.5in colour screen. It was great for writing, and much less cumbersome than my old Filofax.I don’t think PDAs will ever retake the mass market, because large smartphones and small tablets have filled that hole. However, there is still some interest in mini-laptops, which can now reach enthusiasts via Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns.The Gemini PDA, from UK-based Planet Computers, is an attempt to recreate something like the Psion Series 5. The basic machine does the same job for £499 – you can type while on the move – but there’s a £599 version that also works as a 4G smartphone.The Gemini has a 6in screen and runs Android, so it could be a good alternative to a standard Android phone with a 6in to 6.5in screen and a Bluetooth keyboard. It also dual-boots to Linux, so you can run full web browsers and productivity software such as LibreOffice. Unfortunately for those of us who live in Microsoft Office, it doesn’t run Windows 10, which is a bit of a shame as Microsoft’s operating system is free on small-screen devices.All of these mini-laptops have a screen resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, so they can run Windows 10 properly. (Old-style 7in netbooks – popular between 2007 and 2011 – had 1024 x 768-pixel screens.) But you would have to use scaling to make text comfortable to read.Netbooks succeeded because the versions with 7in screens, 1GB of memory and a cut-price version of Windows XP were familiar enough to be accessible, and they were cheap. However, most people wanted bigger screens – they quickly increased to about 10in – more memory and more storage. This closed the price gap to “proper” laptops, and the netbook market collapsed.Most of today’s mini-laptops and convertibles now have even bigger screens, typically from 11.6in to 14in. I have 10.1in, 11.6in and 12in convertibles, and I’ve found that the combination of the extra screen area and higher resolution makes a worthwhile difference to usability. However, at 12in and above, you start to lose portability.Any of these would slip in your bag, while also being capable of doing real work writing reports.Have you got a question?

The Fête des Vignerons – which was granted Unesco intangible cultural heritage status in 2016 – was founded in 1797 to honour the wine-makers of the Lavaux wine region, one of Switzerland’s premier wine appellations.Today, the Fête des Vignerons (18 July-11 August) is a celebration that is only held every 20 years. Its centrepiece is 20 live shows in a specially built 20,000-seat arena but there are also daily parades, costumed wine-themed performances, workshops, wine and food tastings, music and more. A million visitors are expected to attend the event.While this grape gala puts Vevey in the spotlight, there’s an array of things to see and do, year-round, that will raise spirits without (necessarily) raising blood-alcohol levels – and here is our pick of 10 of them …In Charlie Chaplin’s former estate (which he moved to after effectively being exiled from the US in 1953), Chaplin’s World is the only museum dedicated to the revered comic actor and film-maker. Even if you’re not a devoted fan, it’s worth visiting this interactive museum. Peppered with letters, photos and original furnishings, the home is also filled with lifelike wax figures of Chaplin and his famous friends (such as Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein). Recorded television performances and home movies of Chaplin and his family are enthralling. A nearby complex holds recreations of Hollywood film stages from his movies, where guests are encouraged to act out some of his most famous scenes.• Adult £20, 6-15 £14.50, under 6 free, chaplinsworldOn the north-eastern shore of Lake Geneva, Vevey offers mountain views at every turn. For the most picturesque stroll, head to the town’s lakeside, tree-lined promenade (Quai Perdonnet). It passes along the old town and by some of the town’s museums – plus a couple of tiny parks. Keep an eye out for the bronze Chaplin statue (near the Alimentarium food museum), as well as the huge silver fork sculpture rising out of the lake.This small, eclectic museum specialises in prints and drawings from Swiss and international artists, with a collection that s from the 16th to the 21st century. It also has the world’s largest collection of art by Viennese expressionist Oskar Kokoschka. Of particular interest are works by Alechinsky, Courbet, Dürer, Hodler, Picasso, Rembrandt and Vallotton.

Zimmerli embraced the building’s reputation of being haunted by spirits of the past (Zimmerli says multiple people have seen a woman looking out from one of the hotel’s windows, even when it was empty) and outfitted each of the four rooms with a different spine-tingling theme to rouse the morbid corners of guest’s imaginations.The Black Monarch isn’t unique in Victor in that sense. Strange sounds, moving objects and the appearance of translucent miners or bordello sex workers are said to haunt the entire miniature town.Victor looks as it did in its heyday of the early 20th century, when it was the fifth largest city in the state and was pumping out billions of dollars of gold (adjusted for inflation) out of the 500 mines that surrounded it. The town went from a booming economy with a population of 18,000 to nearly a ghost town by the 1990s, and it has a bloody past.When miners attempted to organize, the corporations that owned the mines were ruthless in their union-busting techniques. “They hired gangsters to commit countless murders, train derailments, set fires, purposely collapse mines with people inside them,” says Zimmerli.At the time, the Black Monarch was known simply as the Monarch, an upscale gentlemen’s club, where many of the millionaires who committed these atrocities likely gambled and drank before venturing upstairs to the bordello.During the renovation, Zimmerli has maintained much of the design of a gold rush saloon (tall ceilings, tin-plated walls) but added a gothic tone in the form of black walls and ceilings, countless taxidermied animals, skulls and vast libraries of books with titles like Carnal Crimes, Diseases of Children and The History of the Devil.The HH Holmes room, named for the World’s Fair serial killer who executed tourists while they slept in his hotel, is decorated with several human anatomy posters, antique medical equipment and instruments of torture like pitchforks, scythes and axes on the wall.The room baring the name of Elizabeth Bathory, the 17th century Hungarian countess who is said to have bathed in the blood of her victims, is adorned with crimson walls, a bat encased in red velvet and ominous portraits of Bathory (including a sculpture of her in a red bath surrounded by heads on spikes) watching you while you sleep in a four-poster bed with black, sheer curtains.The witchcraft room features pentagrams, goat skulls and an enormous bed suspended from the ceiling on thick ropes. In the nearby Nikola Tesla room (named for the pioneering and wildly eccentric electrical science genius) a series of elk skulls with enormous antlers are mounted above the bed next to oversized drawings of the Tesla coil, angry swirls of electricity mirroring the reaching antlers in a very menacing way.“I’ve seen people get so scared here they leave only a few hours after checking in,” the caretaker Jennings Davis says in a thick Mississippi accent.Many of Victor’s current residents don’t feel terrorized by the town’s spooky appearances.“We live with it every day, and aren’t frightened by it,” said Sue Kochevar, the co-owner of Victor’s only restaurant, the Fortune Club Diner. Located across the street from the Black Monarch, Kochevar says she often hears the sounds of footsteps in her empty building late at night, or objects falling randomly from shelves and locked bedrooms ransacked from the inside.“We get a lot of paranormal investigators here,” she adds. “And they say there’s a lot of residual energy here from the gold rush days.”In fact, many residents are welcoming the travelers motivated by rumors of hauntings.Colorado’s haunted hotel industry boomed in no small part due to its role in the iconic horror novel and film The Shining.Stephen King got the idea for The Shining at Colorado’s Stanley Hotel, and the place has managed to become one of the most popular destinations among paranormal tourists, particularly during its annual horror film festival. Room 217 – the one King was checked into during his lightbulb moment, and later used in the book – is the most frequently requested room, because of rumors of it being haunted.Forty years later, rumors of hauntings have become a selling point, not a deterrent, for travelers across the US.When The Shining was originally filmed at the Timberline Lodge in Oregon, in 1979, the hotel’s management were so concerned about a PR crisis they requested that room 217 of the book be changed to 237 in Kubrick’s film, because they actually did have a room 217 and were afraid guests would think it was haunted. These days, the Timberline often gets requests from visitors who want to stay in the hotel where The Shining was filmed, some of them specifically for rooms 217 and 237.In 1912, six children and two adults were murdered inside a small farmhouse in Villisca, Iowa, deterring potential renters or buyers of the property for years until a series of YouTube videos suggesting the house was haunted circulated among the ghost hunting community. The owner was suddenly inundated with requests to stay the night. Despite having no running water or electricity, guests will now pay $428 a night to sleep in what is now advertised as “The Villisca Axe Murder House.” In 2014, one such guest of the house was found alone in a bedroom with a self-inflicted stab wound at 12.45am – the approximate time the axe murderer had struck more than a century earlier.Stories like this are irresistible fodder to ghost hunters aiming to legitimize their profession. But for those looking for a more synthetic kind of terror with no real danger attached to it – similar to riding a rollercoaster or eating a habanero pepper – the vague, harmless glimpses of the supernatural experienced in Victor, Colorado, (whether real or imagined) are a bit more appealing.Every hour of the weekend I spent in the Black Monarch hotel was punctuated with countless moments of adrenalized terror, believing I’d seen, heard or felt the presence of some gold rush apparition. I was primed for this at every turn, considering the lore and decor of the hotel, but it was a lot of fun.“The people who come here love to be scared,” says Kochevar. “And that’s fine. But for us that live here in Victor, we like it for its authenticity, and the history of the town. All the ghost stuff is nice, but it’s just something extra that we’ve all gotten used to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9dec6c6c078851091df573748524c5351c67113/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6d3aeefc05ba010d645f0d9ce247605","title":"drc ebola epidemic is international emergency says who","story":"Organisation calls for more funds as 2,512 cases are confirmed in the regionThe Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a public health emergency of international concern, the World Health Organization has declared, calling for more funds and support to close it down.The second biggest Ebola outbreak ever, after the 2014-16 epidemic in west Africa, has reached a critical point with the diagnosis of a case in Goma, a city of 2 million people, which is a transport hub on the border with Rwanda. That follows the case last week of a women who crossed into Uganda to buy fish – and the arrival of a family harbouring the virus, three of whom died, in Uganda last month.Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, appealed on Wednesday for the international community to help with funds. WHO is working on a new plan to control the epidemic, he said, which would cost “hundred of millions” of dollars.“It is time for the world to take notice and redouble our efforts. We need to work together in solidarity with the DRC to end this outbreak and build a better health system,” said Tedros.“Extraordinary work has been done for almost a year under the most difficult circumstances. We all owe it to these responders – coming from not just WHO but also government, partners and communities – to shoulder more of the burden.”He has made previous appeals for donors to provide the money they have promised. So far, only about half the pledges have come in. The WHO was not aware of any donor who has withheld funding because an emergency had not been declared, he said, “but if that was the excuse, it can no longer be used”.Tedros appealed for countries not to seal their borders or close down travel to the DRC, arguing that it would only harm the attempts to end the epidemic.One year on from the start of the epidemic in North Kivu, there have been 2,512 cases of the disease and 676 deaths, most of which have been confirmed.This is the second biggest Ebola outbreak, after the west Africa epidemic, where 28,616 cases of disease and 11,310 deaths were reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2014 and 2016.The WHO is not only alarmed about the arrival of the virus in Uganda and on the Rwandan border, but also by the flare-up again in Beni. “The geographical expansion is now 500km,” said Prof Robert Steffen, chair of the IHR emergency committee on Ebola in DRC, as he announced their advice to Tedros.The WHO’s declaration was widely applauded by Ebola experts and the aid organisations struggling with the epidemic on the ground.“This is perhaps the most complicated epidemic the world has ever had to face, yet still the response in the DRC remains overstretched and underfunded,” said Dr Josie Golding, epidemics lead at Wellcome. “A step-up in the response, led by the DRC and with full international support, is critical if we are to bring the epidemic to an end. This must include enhanced diplomatic, public health, security and logistic efforts as well as releasing much needed financial resources.”Larry Gostin, the director of the O’Neill Institute in Washington DC and an expert on global health law, said the announcement gave the clearest possible signal that the WHO needs more financial and human resources. “Without a surge response, it will be impossible to bring the DRC Ebola epidemic under control.”He called for bold action. “Standard strategies like case identification, vaccination and treatment can’t succeed in a complex humanitarian crisis like the situation in the DRC. Responders in the field are facing intense violence along with deep community mistrust. They often can’t get into the hot zone due to escalating violence and they can’t find cases to vaccinate and treat because families are hiding the sick. There has been no clear strategy to break the vicious cycle of disease, violence and distrust.”The status quo is no longer tenable, Gostin said. “The complacency in the international community, including the United States, is crippling the response.”The British Red Cross, Mercy Corps and World Vision, all of which are working on the ground, said they hoped the declaration would lead to a significant scale-up in the response. “A huge push and significant funding across the region are now required to contain this outbreak and bring it to an end. Otherwise, there is a real risk we will see a catastrophic spread of this deadly virus,” said Sarah Clayton-Fisher of the British Red Cross.The possible arrival of the virus in Goma has long been feared by the agencies responding to the outbreak, because of its density and the movement of people through it to Rwanda.“Ring” vaccination of the contacts of those who fall ill and their contacts has not succeeded in limiting the spread of the virus. There is mistrust of the vaccine. Some people falsely believe that the vaccine is what is making people sick, in part because it cannot protect anyone who is already infected when they have the shot. It is also very hard to track and trace the friends and relatives of the sick in areas where violent conflict is taking place.“If we cannot contain Ebola at the epicentre, we will continue to see cases spread to metropolitan areas and across borders,” said Bob Kitchen, International Rescue Committee’s vice-president for emergencies.“The inability to build community trust has proven a major barrier to stopping the spread of this disease. Local communities are perplexed and frustrated by continued increase in the number of people dying juxtaposed with a massive influx of international organisations into the region during the past year.”There have been four declarations of public health emergencies since 2005, when the WHO’s new regulations were introduced: swine flu in 2009, polio in 2014, when there was a resurgence after near-eradication, Ebola in west Africa in 2014 and the Zika virus in Brazil in 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01354784c6b62aa195db3a4ec31d7c125d9769fb/708_449_4908_2945/master/4908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91e5e7a5da0b5caebbcf6c7570dc74e6","title":"g7 leaders to back tech revolution for african women","story":"World leaders to back call to help rural poor and women access mobile bankingWorld leaders are to pledge to shape the technological revolution sweeping through Africa by acting to lift the threat of 400 million predominantly rural women being excluded from digital financial services.G7 finance ministers meeting in France are to endorse a paper from the Gates Foundation saying there is a serious risk that digital technology and mobile banking will bypass millions of women in Africa, leaving them disempowered for a generation.The initiative, requiring $255m (£205m) in initial funding and regulatory action across Africa,is designed to prevent “the inequalities of the past being insinuated into the future” as cultural and market barriers lead to women being excluded from mobile banking, e-commerce and smartphone technology.Speaking to the  before addressing finance ministers on Thursday, Melinda Gates, co-founder of the world’s largest private charitable organisation, argued that the G7 should not see digital inclusion as a small step but comparable with its past efforts to address malaria or debt.“Digital financial services is not a lever we had 15 years ago. We have it now. Yet the mobile phone operators are going to pick off the low-hanging fruit, the middle class,” she said. “They are not going to go the extra mile to help the poor or women. We are already seeing these gaps that are going to set back women’s empowerment.“We know from good research that when a woman has her own digital financial bank account, she often moves from the informal farming sector to the formal entrepreneurial sector. When they have assets in their hands, women often invest differently from their husbands. They invest in health and their kids’ education. When women are empowered, economies are lifted out of poverty.“Yet too many women are stuck in the era of the moneylender and the forced chicken sale.”The Gates Foundation argues that as the technology revolution is only just taking root in Africa, the opportunity still exists to shape a modern financial system from its foundations to include and empower everyone.“The old financial system was built to exclude. It excluded the poor, whose transactions were too small to matter. It excluded the rural, who lived too far away from bank branches. It excluded women, whose husbands were supposed to make the decisions,” Gates wrote in the paper to the G7. “It is very hard to retrofit an exclusive system to be inclusive.”Barriers that need addressing include the extent of mobile phone coverage, the inter-operability of technology, proof of identity, regulation and laws that exclude women.Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister and host of the G7, said all these reforms needed backing. “Giving women access to a bank account is key to faster growth in the poorest countries. Our theme at the G7 is addressing inequalities, and this helps,” he said.Although by the end of 2018 nearly 250 million Africans subscribe to the mobile internet, more than three-quarters – 750 million – were still offline, including more than 400 million people for whom there is no mobile broadband.One of the key historic barriers to financial inclusion identified in the report is the relatively primitive type of mobile banking system that only allows money to be transferred between users of the same mobile service.As a result, the majority of digital transactions are still peer-to-peer money transfers within the same network.This means, the report says, “a healthcare worker who receives her wages in a closed-loop mobile money account is likely to withdraw funds in cash – often travelling long distances and incurring fees – to buy food for her family, pay her bills, and send money to her son who lives in a neighbouring country”.The report also suggests difficulties need to be overcome to ensure secure proof of identification, an issue the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, will highlight at the G7 by offering £15m to help fund a World Bank initiative on secure ID systems.Cultural or religious resistance to women’s financial independence is a further barrier, the report says. In Cameroon, Chad, Gabon and Niger formal regulations exist that prevent women from opening a bank account in the same way as men. “All countries have reasons culturally or historically to hold women back,” Gates said. “It takes forward-thinking people at the top and at the grassroots to lead change.”The Gates team believes the digital revolution is not so advanced in Africa that the emerging inequalities are irreversible. Nearly half of people in sub-Saharan Africa who are paid a salary receive their wages in cash, and less than a third pay utility bills through an account.The potential future scale of the transformation is startling. The consultants McKinsey estimate that by 2025 digital financial services could allow 1.6 billion people worldwide to enter the formal economy and could add $3.7tn to the annual GDP of emerging markets.Digital financial inclusion could create nearly 95m new jobs and provide up to $2.1tn in loans for iniduals to start businesses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f920d21b987483d07d38dbe149142b116c9a03d/0_0_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1a5050d8db31daaee014920db23d605","title":"british football fan ali issa ahmad detained in uae lodges un human rights complaint","story":"Ali Issa Ahmad brings case to UN alleging he was tortured after wearing Qatar T-shirt to matchA British football fan who says he was detained and tortured while on holiday in the United Arab Emirates because he wore a Qatar shirt has lodged a legal complaint with the UN about his treatment.In the 27-page complaint, Ali Issa Ahmad, 26, from Wolverhampton, documents his alleged torture at the hands of the UAE authorities in January and February of this year while he was visiting the country to watch Asian Cup matches.He alleges that the ill-treatment included electric shocks during interrogation, stabbings, deprivation of food, water and sleep, and racist abuse. He claims he was called “fucking black”, “donkey” and “dog”. Ahmad also alleges he was punched in the face, knocking out one of his teeth, and had a plastic bag placed over his head for several minutes.In a letter to the UN human rights high commissioner, his lawyer Rodney Dixon QC said Ahmad’s treatment in the UAE breached his human rights including freedom of expression, the right not to be tortured and the right not to be arbitrarily arrested and detained, the  understands.The UN has been asked to intervene in previous cases involving prisoners of conscience. But it is highly unusual for an ordinary football fan to approach the UN and ask it to intervene with a national government in this way.Ahmad has called on the UN to ensure that the UAE provides an effective remedy for his suffering, including compensation.Last week he lodged a complaint with Fifa claiming it had breached its human rights policy by failing to protect him while he was watching a match. Ahmad has also asked the UK Foreign Office to investigate his case.Ahmad’s problems began after a match between Iraq and Qatar on 22 January 2019 at the Al Nahyan stadium in Abu Dhabi. Ahmad says he was approached by UAE security officials because he was wearing a T-shirt with a Qatari logo on it.He says he was unaware that in June 2017, after UAE formally severed links with Qatar, UAE’s attorney general had announced that showing sympathy for Qatar was punishable with three to 15 years in jail.Ahmad said: “Nobody should ever have to suffer what I did simply for wearing a T-shirt with a flag of a country on it.”Dixon, the head of Ahmad’s legal team, said: “It is a disgrace that Ali was tortured so cruelly and gratuitously while attending an international football tournament in the UAE. No football fan should have to endure this kind of inhuman and racist treatment.”The UAE denies Ahmad’s claims of being tortured. A UAE official accused him of lying and “attention-seeking” and said Ahmad had been charged with wasting police time and giving false statements.The official said: “He was categorically not arrested for wearing a Qatar football shirt. This is instead an instance of a person seeking media attention and wasting police time.”Ahmad is not the only British citizen to have experienced arrest and detention in the UAE.

Road deaths fell sharply during the previous decade but numbers have remained roughly static since 2010.Guidance on alcolocks, breathalyser-type devices that stop the vehicle operating if its driver has consumed more than the alcohol limit, will be part of a review of drink driving trends and interventions by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (Pacts). The devices are commonplace in Europe, particularly for operators of commercial and passenger vehicles, and National Express fitted them to their coach fleet some years ago.The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said: “The UK has some of the safest roads in the world, but we are not complacent and continue to look at how we can make them safer.”Road safety minister Michael Ellis said: “Far too many people are not wearing a seatbelt while traveling in a car, needlessly putting their lives at risk.“Increasing penalties for people who disregard the simplest of way of protecting themselves is just one of a long list of actions this government is taking to help keep people safe on our roads.”An advisory panel will also be set up to explore how to boost road safety on rural roads, while campaigns will be set up to further educate children about road safety.The measures come into addition to a trailed possible ban on new drivers taking the wheel at night under a “graduated driver licensing” plan. Insurers welcomed the announcement and urged immediate action. The Association of British Insurers said its “potential to dramatically improve road safety in the UK is indisputable”, adding that there was overwhelming evidence for its effectiveness from places such as Canada, New Zealand and California."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14ce14b5986e01439b2c2e47dbce09e2075e0d31/0_0_6522_3914/master/6522.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12f023bef686c30a19ddd2eef0999480","title":"iran says it has seized foreign oil tanker in gulf","story":"Report on state TV says ship was smuggling oil but does not say which country crew are fromFears for maritime security in the strait of Hormuz, a vital route for oil shipping, have grown after Iran announced it had impounded a foreign tanker it said was smuggling fuel in the Gulf.State television quoting Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said the vessel was intercepted south of Iran’s Larak Island on Sunday after issuing a distress call.“A foreign vessel smuggling 1 million litres of fuel in the Larak Island of the Persian Gulf has been seized,” the station said. “The vessel that Iran towed to its waters after receiving a distress call, was later seized with the order from the court as we found out that it was smuggling fuel.”The Iranians did not initially identify the ship or its owners, but semi-official news agencies suggested the ship was the Panamanian-flagged MT Riah, a ship that went missing on 14 July and appeared to have been taken into Iranian waters in the strait of Hormuz.Nothing has been heard of the ship since it stopped transmitting its location in the early hours of Sunday. Iran did confirm on Tuesday, without naming Riah, that it had helped tow an unidentified boat in distress, but gave no further details.The Guards said in the latest statement that the vessel had been impounded “with an order from the court as we found out that it was smuggling fuel” to foreign ships. The ship is capable of carrying 2m litres and had 12 crew on board. It said it had not impounded any other ship.It is possible that the seizure of the ship is nothing more than a routine piece of Iranian maritime intelligence work, but in the current heightened tensions, western diplomats will fear it is Iranian diplomatic pressure.The UK Foreign Office said it was seeking further information on the ship and insisted that freedom of navigation was paramount.The Iranian seizure could be seen as a tit-for-tat reaction to the seize of the Iranian-owned Indian-crewed Grace 1 a fortnight ago by British Royal marines off Gibraltar.The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is holding talks on Thursday with Gibraltar’s first minister, Fabian Picardo, to discuss what to do about the ship.At the weekend in telephone talks with the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, Hunt offered to release the ship so long as there was an undertaking that the ship’s load would not be taken to Syria, a country that is subject to EU sanctions.The Iranians have said the ship was not bound for Syria, but has refused to name its planned destination..Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran threatening to resume higher uranium enrichment.John Bolton announces the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a bomber task force in response to \u0027a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings\u0027.Iran vows to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its nuclear deal.

A report on state TV says the ship was smuggling oil but does not say which country crew are from.The UK is deeply sceptical of the Iranian explanation and is awaiting a clear Iranian undertaking that the ship will not recommence its journey to Syria.Unlike the US, the UK has no general policy of trying to block Iranian oil sales, but Tehran regards the British action as part of an attempt to support the US campaign to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero.The disputes over the ships are all part of wider manoeuvring between Iran, Europe and the US over the future of the Iran nuclear deal signed in 2015 and known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA).Donald Trump pulled America out of the deal a year ago, saying its terms did not restrict Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb, but the Europeans have continued to back the deal.Iran has started to lessen its commitments to JCPOA in the past month in protest at what it regards as Europe’s failure to set up an effective trading mechanism between Iran and Europe, designed to boost trade. An increase in trade with Europe was always seen by Iran as a central benefit of signing up to the restrictions imposed in the nuclear deal.The seizure of the latest ship, following a series of attacks and interruptions of shipping over the last fortnight in the Gulf, will put the issue of maritime security in the strait of Hormuz back at the heart of international discussions.In the last months there have been six unattributed attacks on Gulf shipping as well as an attempt to intercept a British ship in the Gulf a fortnight ago.The US has sent advanced fighter jets and thousands of extra troops into the Middle East while attacks on oil tankers and the shooting down of a US military surveillance drone by Iran have added to the fears of an armed conflict breaking out.The US has been pushing for an internationally coordinated maritime force to accompany cargo through the strait, and Bahrain has agreed to stage a conference to develop these plans. The Bahrain conference is not due to be held until October and as many as 60 nations are due to attend.Referring to the US plans to install surveillance and protection for ships passing through the Gulf, Brian Hook, the US special representative on Iran, said that Washington has already sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region, adding, “the move has disrupted and deterred much of what we feared” with Iranian plots in the area.Hook added he would meet ambassadors on Friday to promote the US plan to build a maritime coalition to deter further attacks on the oil tankers in the Gulf."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Sides seek adjournment for one week to consider whether to appeal judge\u0026rsquos rulingGifts included \u0026lsquohis much travelled hat\u0026rsquo and an LP \u0026lsquobecause of his love of music\u0026rsquoEx-member of Irish military went to Syria in 2015, where she is being held with her childTaoiseach says temporary structures set up at Dublin Airport and Dublin and Rosslare seaportsSince 2009, MEPs can no longer employ close relatives for parliamentary roles\u0026lsquoWe are currently massively unprepared for the climate-driven movement of species\u0026rsquoIreland likely to miss out on temperature extremes but conditions should be warmVaradkar pledge to raise highest tax band would cost \u0026euro2.3bn in a yearOpening of motorway section costing nearly \u0026euro350 million set to end long tailbacks in Co Wexford townUtility will notify customers who appear to be consuming water services excessivelyFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says next British prime minister must deal with existing Brexit dealRadio chatter from the Apollo 11 landing still sounds like science fiction 50 years onSenator Mark Daly says Government must establish second New Ireland ForumAdoption Authority has identified 160 potential locations where files are being heldLegislation paving way for abortion will have \u0026lsquodevastating impact\u0026rsquo on rights of unbornThames Water\u0026rsquos plant is one renewable but costly model for \u0026lsquowater-stressed\u0026rsquo regionsGovernment urged to postpone poll and focus on Britain\u0026rsquos impending exit from EUChanges by councillors to allow developments on Valentia and Cahersiveen criticisedAt Explorium, Dublin\u0026rsquos marvellous sports and science centre, children can\u0026rsquot avoid learning \u0026ndash try as they might"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3960351.1563445695!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"commons set for showdown over suspension of parliament vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA pedestrian walks past the Union and EU flags of anti-Brexit activists near the Houses of Parliament in London in March. Photograph: Getty ImagesA showdown over moves to prevent a no-deal Brexit will provoke a British House of Commons clash on Thursday.MPs will have the chance to vote on legislation that could potentially thwart efforts by the next prime minister to try to suspend parliament to force through EU withdrawal without an agreement on October 31.The clash is looming because the Lords strongly backed a bid to block Parliament being suspended in order to facilitate a no-deal exit by a margin of 103 votes on Wednesday.Labour joined Liberal Democrats and leading independent crossbenchers in the upper house to try to scupper what opposition peers branded a “constitutional outrage” by amending Northern Ireland legislation.The change to the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill will require progress reports on restoring devolved government in Northern Ireland to be debated regularly in parliament, effectively preventing it being prorogued.The return of the bill to the Commons on Thursday could see further amendments by anti-no-deal MPs selected by the speaker John Bercow. The move comes amid reports that some ministers could resign in order to back efforts to block no-deal if a free vote on the issue is not offered by prime minister Theresa May. Justice secretary David Gauke said proroguing parliament would be “outrageous” but did not confirm whether he would back the measures to block it.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I will have to see what the precise amendments are and we’re hearing what the whipping will be and the arguments for that so I’m not in a position to necessarily say.“But what I would say is the idea that parliament should be suspended in October — a period where it always sits, parliament has always in recent years sat at that time of year.“And at a crucial point in this country’s history, if you like — that parliament should not be able to sit, should not be able to express its opinion and its will, I think would be outrageous.Front runner for the Tory leadership Boris Johnson again refused at the final campaign hustings on Wednesday to rule out proroguing — suspending — parliament to meet his red line of getting the UK out of the EU by October 31st.Leadership rival Jeremy Hunt has insisted he would not use such a constitutional manoeuvre to force EU withdrawal.The amendment to the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill builds on an amendment passed in the Commons last week, when MPs backed a proposal from the pro-European Tory Dominic Grieve calling for fortnightly reports from the government on the efforts to restore the power-sharing executive.The new Lords amendment would ensure these have to be debated in the weeks before the Brexit deadline.The bill could theoretically make it illegal for the government to prorogue parliament in the autumn if the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland has not been restored. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Tory leadership latest: John Bercow throws no-deal rebels a lifeline after selecting cross-party amendment to stop suspension of parliamentComment: Our innovative approach to global conflict is a vital part of standing up for British valuesSwarm of flying ants over England so dense it could be seen from spacePakistan former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi held in graft probeBoris Johnson\u0026#39s claim that EU forces kippers to be packed with \u0026#39ice pillows\u0026#39 exposed as wrongOrangutan numbers drop as much as 30 per cent in Malaysian palm oil estate forestsIran seizes Emirati oil tanker in Strait of HormuzAt least 24 dead in \u0026#39arson\u0026#39 attack at Japanese animation studio in KyotoComment: Diary of a Reluctant MEP: a week of propaganda, big promises and copious bleedingComment: Kamikaze Remainers know it\u0026#39s over, but they have never looked more defiantKnife crime soars in rural areas by as much as 50 per cent as violence epidemic spreads out of citiesBrother of Manchester Arena bomber to deny being part of terror plotThe Moon landing at 50: Debunking the conspiracy theoriesMeals suspended from Virgin first-class carriages after failing temperature testsInstagram begins hiding likes on posts as part of trial to \u0026#39remove pressure\u0026#39 of popularityComment: Beauty is bigger than the car industry – it\u0026#39s about time we took it seriouslyTrump rally crowd chants \u0026#39send her back\u0026#39 as president attacks congresswoman Ilhan OmarHouse votes to hold Attorney General Barr and commerce chief in criminal contempt of CongressHouse votes to block impeachment resolution against Donald Trump over \u0026#39racist\u0026#39 tweets -

The disease, spread by ticks, appears to be on the rise: in 1997 there were 12,800 confirmed cases, rising to 29,500 in 2017 – the most recent year for which data is available.Earlier this year Mr Smith introduced the Ticks: Identify, Control, and Knockout Act\u0027\u0027 (TICK Act), a bill to come up with a national strategy to fight Lyme disease. If passed, the measure would authorize an additional $180 million to boost funding for Lyme disease research, prevention and treatment programmes.The CDC currently spends about $11 million on Lyme disease research.Mr Smith\u0027s tick amendment is not certain to make it into the final defence spending measure. Both the House and Senate have passed their own versions, and representatives from both the House and Senate will meet in conference committee to reconcile the two bills.Tory leadership latest: MPs vote on cross-party amendment to stop suspension of parliament after being thrown lifeline by John Bercow Comment: Our innovative approach to global conflict is a vital part of standing up for British valuesSwarm of flying ants over England so dense it could be seen from spacePakistan former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi held in graft probeBoris Johnson\u0026#39s claim that EU forces kippers to be packed with \u0026#39ice pillows\u0026#39 exposed as wrongOrangutan numbers drop as much as 30 per cent in Malaysian palm oil estate forestsIran seizes Emirati oil tanker in Strait of HormuzAt least 24 dead in \u0026#39arson\u0026#39 attack at Japanese animation studio in KyotoComment: Diary of a Reluctant MEP: a week of propaganda, big promises and copious bleedingComment: Kamikaze Remainers know it\u0026#39s over, but they have never looked more defiantKnife crime soars in rural areas by as much as 50 per cent as violence epidemic spreads out of citiesBrother of Manchester Arena bomber to deny being part of terror plotThe Moon landing at 50: Debunking the conspiracy theoriesMeals suspended from Virgin first-class carriages after failing temperature testsInstagram begins hiding likes on posts as part of trial to \u0026#39remove pressure\u0026#39 of popularityComment: Beauty is bigger than the car industry – it\u0026#39s about time we took it seriouslyTrump rally crowd chants \u0026#39send her back\u0026#39 as president attacks congresswoman Ilhan OmarHouse votes to hold Attorney General Barr and commerce chief in criminal contempt of CongressHouse votes to block impeachment resolution against Donald Trump over \u0026#39racist\u0026#39 tweets - for nowWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal family pictures week","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive for the Mens Singles Final between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon in LondonPaul Grover for the Tory leadership latest: MPs vote on cross-party amendment to stop suspension of parliament after being thrown lifeline by John Bercow Comment: Our innovative approach to global conflict is a vital part of standing up for British valuesSwarm of flying ants over England so dense it could be seen from spacePakistan former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi held in graft probeBoris Johnson\u0026#39s claim that EU forces kippers to be packed with \u0026#39ice pillows\u0026#39 exposed as wrongOrangutan numbers drop as much as 30 per cent in Malaysian palm oil estate forestsIran seizes oil tanker in Strait of HormuzAt least 24 dead in \u0026#39arson\u0026#39 attack at Japanese animation studio in KyotoComment: Diary of a Reluctant MEP: a week of propaganda, big promises and copious bleedingComment: Kamikaze Remainers know it\u0026#39s over, but they have never looked more defiantKnife crime soars in rural areas by as much as 50 per cent as violence epidemic spreads out of citiesBrother of Manchester Arena bomber to deny being part of terror plotThe Moon landing at 50: Debunking the conspiracy theoriesMeals suspended from Virgin first-class carriages after failing temperature testsInstagram begins hiding likes on posts as part of trial to \u0026#39remove pressure\u0026#39 of popularityComment: Beauty is bigger than the car industry – it\u0026#39s about time we took it seriouslyTrump rally crowd chants \u0026#39send her back\u0026#39 as president attacks congresswoman Ilhan OmarHouse votes to hold Attorney General Barr and commerce chief in criminal contempt of CongressHouse votes to block impeachment resolution against Donald Trump over \u0026#39racist\u0026#39 tweets - for nowWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/17/TELEMMGLPICT000086692826_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVLa3QPVTMHf7Wtw837j9bT_ZHd_GpdvVEr1Uqt6ZitU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"teenagers irritable prone procrastination due using social media","story":"Bupa released the results of its first index of teenagers\u0026#39 mental healthTeenagers are becoming more irritable and prone to procrastination because they are using social media earlier in life, a new study has found.A survey of 2,000 13 to 19-year-olds revealed those who started using social media the earliest showed stronger signs of ten mental health symptoms, including anxiety, feeling overwhelmed and insomnia.The symptoms most commonly felt by teenagers who used social media from a young age were ‘irritability’ and ‘low self-esteem’. In contrast, teenagers who did not use social media at all reported lower instances of all ten symptoms. The study, carried out by Opinium for the health care provider Bupa, showed that almost a fifth of teenagers had started using social media at age 10 or younger. Social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but the process is easily circumvented as there is currently no watertight age verification.More than a quarter of teenagers (27 percent) admitted that they had a social media account their parents didn’t know about.The research also found that social media is making teenagers more stressed as more than half (53 percent) said it distracted them from schoolwork, which in turn led to them becoming more concerned about their academic performance.Bupa said the results are the first in what will become an annual index of the state of young people’s mental health, which the company has committed to carrying out after seeing claims for mental health issues double in the last ten years.Dr. Pablo Vandenabeele, Clinical Director for Mental Health at Bupa UK, says: “It’s really tough for parents these days to protect their child from things that could harm their mental health.“Even restricting ‘screen time’ or specific social media might not be enough, and our findings suggest some social platforms can significantly drive up anxiety and stress, especially if the child starts on them at a young age.“Despite the stereotype, teens really judge themselves on their academic performance, but social can promote procrastination, which amplifies this stress and worries around grades.” The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The overall population of orangutans in Sabah remained steady at around 11,000.While the orangutan population has stabilised in large forest areas, their numbers declined in forest patches within oil palm landscapes of the eastern lowlands of Sabah, WWF said in a statement.Oil from the palm fruit is used in a vast array of household groceries, including shampoo, soap, bread and biscuitsThe monoculture nature of oil palm plantations means that they tend not to support species that are dependent on forest environment like the orangutan.But forest patches within plantation landscapes allowed orangutans to travel between forested areas and were key to their survival, especially in the lowlands of Sabah, said Augustine Tuuga, director of Sabah Wildlife Department.Malaysia relies on palm oil - a commodity used in everything from chocolate spread to lipstick - for billions of dollars in foreign exchange earnings and hundreds of thousands of jobs.It is the Southeast Asian country\u0027s largest agricultural crop and export. Malaysia, the world\u0027s second-largest grower of palm oil after Indonesia, counts Sabah as its top producing state.The palm oil industry has caused widespread deforestation over the years as land is cleared, often by heavily polluting slash-and-burn practices, to make way for new estates. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Pundits give him an agonising  days from next Tuesday to honour that promise.In fact, we will know in an instantBrexit — and Boris — will live or die.The moment will come, perhaps on his first day, as he names the man or woman to prise the Treasury from the cold, dead hands of Chancellor Philip Hammond.If Boris picks Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock or Liz Truss — or anyone  who voted Remain — .million Brits can kiss goodbye to their dream of leaving the European Union.We will end up with a just another bodged version of Theresa May’s BRINO sell-out — Brexit in Name Only. It will be the beginning and the end of King BoJo the First.There will be no second chances. The next Chancellor of the Exchequer must be a proven Brexiteer in word and deedBoris has a chance of surviving his  days.The Treasury is the most powerful and implacable enemy of Brexit. “The new Chancellor needs three key qualities,” says a source close to Boris.“They must have a Brexit pedigree, absolute loyalty to Boris and the intellectual self-confidence to take on Whitehall and the Treasury.”Qualities such as these are scarce in the present Cabinet. The final choice is likely to surprise everyone, especially Remainers.Some names mentioned to me would, to say the least, offer a bracing challenge to pro-EU establishment fanatics who spent the past three years sabotaging the  referendum.Unless the new Chancellor takes them head-on, those forces will crush both Boris and Brexit. Observers have identied the tank traps and sniper nests facing the new PM.He is up against a Remain-dominated Parliament aided by slippery Speaker Bercow, an army of civil service mandarins skilled in the machinery of government and covering fire from BBC propagandists.In the face of such overwhelming odds, a pro-Leave PM is surely doomed to fail. Not so. Despite appearances, Boris has a plan.He will fly immediately to Brussels with a genuine bid to reopen Theresa May’s botched withdrawal agreement.He would seek a clear path out of the EU customs union, single market and European Court jurisdiction, plus a sensible solution to the Northern Ireland border issue.The alternative will be for Britain to leave the EU on October  with No Deal. Unless much has changed, Brussels will say: “Non!” Boris will announce he has no option but to call a snap “No Deal” election.Remainers are appalled at the idea, and for good reason. Poll after poll suggests No Deal Boris would win with an outright majority — at their expense.The public is sick to the back teeth with Theresa May’s dreary defeatism and Brussels’ bullying. Remain voters want this sorted, too.Elections are always risky. But a Tory Party still dithering and paralysed on the biggest issue of the age is the greatest risk of all. Right now, the omens are promising. Labour is committing ritual suicide, shedding voters in droves.Millions of Tory defectors would flock back to a party committed to a final, irreversible Brexit taking us past the October  dead-line and sucking support from Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.In the intervening weeks, a Boris regime could recruit voters abandoned by both major parties over crime, low pay, high taxes and housing.According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, blue- collar voters on less than £, a year, are “up for grabs like never before”.If Boris Johnson has one proven gt, it is for winning against the odds. In fact, despite gloom-mongers, the odds could not be better.To quote Boris, there is an appetite among voters for optimism . . .  stepping off the “hamster wheel of doom”. So brace yourselves for an early general election, folks — and round two of King BoJo.In a PC world gone mad, this is surely the moment to bring in the men women gender non-specic folk in white coats.People now risk losing their livelihoods for invented “hate crimes” on transgender bullying, Islamic extremism or mass immigration.Now Theresa May is transiting into Big Brother by threatening to punish newspapers who publish embarrassing leaks.It is George Orwell’s nightmare novel  brought terryingly to le.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has threatened journalists, too, that they face prosecutionthey dare to publish the content of the cables.Trying to justy his threats, the Met’s Assistant Commissioner, Neil Basu, said he was sure the leaks had “damaged UK international relations” and on that basis no one publishing the leaks could plead a public interest defence.What a ludicrous over-reaction to what is really no more than a diplomatic spat over the Ferrero Rochers.Sure, it doesn’t exactly help UK US relations when our Ambassador calls the President of the United States “inept” and his administration “uniquely dysal”.But I would say it is mildly less damaging than some of the things that the Leader of Opposition, the Mayor of London and Scotland’s First Minister have said about Donald Trump. I can’t see Mr Basu dangling his handcuffs in front of them — and neither should he.Obviously, Sir Kim has reason to feel aggrieved that someone — presumably in the diplomatic service or the Foreign Office, because there is no evidence of computers being hacked — has leaked information he intended to be private. But it is a matter for the Government to investigate, not the police.How ridiculous Basu has said of the leaker: “You are now also responsible for erting busy detectives from under-taking their core mission.”No, Mr Basu — it is only thanks to your decision that officers have been taken off front-line duties to undertake this investigation.You could have told officials what police officers are forever telling the rest of us when we report our houses broken into or our bikes stolen: Sorry, but we’ve got too much  to do.It would be a dferent mattersomeone had leaked material that really did harm national security.The sort of information leaked by Kim Philby and his Soviet-sympathising accomplices in the s put British lives at risk.But leaking and publishing a diplomat’s private thoughts hardly comes into that category. Mr Basu’s attack on the principles of the free Press echoes Operation Elveden, the failed attempt by the Met to criminalise journalists who had obtained information from police officers, in some cases for money.The Met switched more than  police officers from other duties and arrested  people. The police probe cost taxpayers £.million and yet of  journalists charged, only one was convicted at trial — and that was quashed on appeal. Just one journalist, Dan Evans, pleaded guilty to an Elveden offence and was given a suspended sentence.The prosecutions relied on an ancient offence, Misconduct in Public Office, which was only ever supposed to apply to public servants, not journalists.As many lawyers, including the Lord Chief Justice, pointed out, it simply isn’t a criminal offence for someone to receive or to publish most forms of state information — only for a public official to sell it.There is a very good reason for this. Leaks, and the freedom to put their contents into the public domain, are an essential ingredient of our democracy. It is what helps the Press to keep in check corrupt or over-bearing politicians and public officials.Without the freedom to publish leaked information, for example, we would never have known the extent to which MPs and Lords were abusing their expenses regime.That required a newspaper to publish information gleaned from a computer disk which had been stolen — but thankfully in that case the Met decided that the public interest over-rode a possible offence of handling stolen goods.Without the Panama Papers we would never have known the extent to which wealthy iniduals and corporations have gone into keeping their wealth out of the taxman’s grasp. Without the “climategate” leaks we would not have known how some climate scientists were prepared to manipulate past temperature records to support their theories.It took a leak, too, to establish that the Blair government knew it was unlikely that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but that George W Bush had resolved to overthrow Saddam regardless.Then there was “Plebgate”, when a leaked police log revealed a bust-up between government chief whip Andrew Mitchell and police manning the gates at Downing Street — and led an officer to be jailed when it was revealed he had invented his witness statement.There are, of course, plenty of other countries in the world where journalists would be locked up for publishing information that has leaked from the government, but they are not countries in which most of us would want to live.By over-reacting to what is an embarrassment to the Foreign Office, the Met has taken a leaf out of the book of President Erdogan of Turkey, who has locked up dozens of journalists as he attempts to suppress all opposition to his regime.Neil Basu and other senior Met Police officers should back off and accept that the Press is quite within its rights to publish leaked information that does not threaten national security.We are, after all, one of the world’s oldest ing democracies — not a tinpot state where people get led off in chains for daring to reveal the truth. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His English was fairly limited and my Spanish went no further than: “Paella, mucho gracias.”So when, after several minutes of discussing the musical inspiration for his new single album , I went in for the killer question.“How many women have you slept with ”He shrugged.“ ” I ventured.He pulled an expression to suggest I had woefully misjudged his pulling power with the opposite sex. So I aimed higher.“, ”“Ooo knows ” he drawled with a lazy smile. “A gentleman  . . .  he never tell.”“Shall we go with , then ” I suggested, aswe were making a joint entry to one of those “guess how many sweets” attractions at the local fete. He shrugged again, a gesture I took as implicit confirmation. Well, he didn’t deny it.The interview appeared the following day and shortly afterwards the figure went global when the US-based National Enquirer ran with it.Julio, who is charm personied, made no complaint when his legendary Lothario-ism went stratospheric, though many years later he mitigated to another interviewer who broached the subject: “Me, I don’t have numbers. I respect women very much.”Like Mick Jagger, who is said to have bedded around , women, the Spanish crooner joined the ranks of Warren Beatty, Errol Flynn, Jack Nicholson and the notorious lover Casanova as one of history’s great seducers.Back then, such, ahem, swordsmanship was admired. The majority of women swooned at the mere thought of a sacred moment in their seductive gaze, while young men felt both inspired and intimidated by such a dizzyingly high number of sexual conquests.But now  Thanks to the #metoo and #timesup campaigns, men with more notches on their bedposts than the rest of us have had hot dinners are regarded with certain distaste. Last week, Julio’s tongue-in-cheek statistic popped up again, when a -year-old man finally won recognition as the star’s son — the product of a brief affair in the s.Suddenly, the legendary “,” was being viewed through the modern-day, more puritanical prism, where such behaviour might be regarded as “sex addiction”.Whatever the truth , he’s now been with we Miranda Rijnsburger for more than  years and they have five children.So it’s fair to say that his womanising days are long gone. Just as well, perhaps. Because,the Love Island men are anything to go by, old roues are now old hat and it’s romantic and wholly faithful young men like Tommy Fury who, quite rightly, earn the nation’s admiration. Long may it go on.Though it seems there are still some lotharios refusing to go quietly. Last year, Italian playboy Maurizio Zanfanti,  — dubbed the “Romeo of Rimini” after claiming to have slept with , women — died while having sex with a -year-old tourist in his car. It’s what he would have wanted.JOBLESS Daniel Eyers and his pregnant partner Lucrezia Worrell say they have been evicted from their Kent council house for spending their rent money on takeaways.The couple, who have four children, are now living with Daniel’s mum. Daniel, , says: “I can’t get a job as it would mean my children would miss out on school, as I have to drive them there every day.”Oh let me count the ways.A flexible, part-time job perhaps  How about your partner taking them to school, or asking other parents for a lt  Or perhaps desisting from having a fth childyou can’t afford to keep the other four Meanwhile, let us compare and contrast this “can’t do” attitude with that of this father in Vietnam who drags his son across a raging, muddy river in a plastic bag so he can get to school, before ing to his remote village to work.A couple of years ago, we cowered inside a friend’s French holiday home as hailstones the size of golf balls rained down outside.Oh how we laughed . . . until I remembered our hire car parked outside.It was peppered with more dents than a Swiss cheese and, because we hadn’t taken out the “full insurance”, left us with a bill that cost more than the actual holiday.A BRIEF chat in front of the assembled cameras at Wimbledon was all it took for the Duchesses of Cambridgeand Sussexto dispel the long-standing rumours of a spat.Several weeks ago, it was also reported that the Duchess of Cambridge had fallen out with Rose Hanbury, one of her closest friends in the “Norfolk set”.The story has been dismissed as “unsubstantiated rumours” by sources within the Palace but it flared up again when Rose attended the recent Trump banquet without her husbandand was seated in practically a separate postcode to her old chum. Of course, they could kill those rumours stone dead too by being photographed together while out shopping or having lunch.That it hasn’t happened perhaps speaks volumes.AMAL CLOONEY is a well-regarded human rights lawyer who, together with husband George, uses her  to highlight ious liberal causes.So I was rather perplexed to hear – via a -page leaked document – that in  she reportedly gave legal advice to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on how to potentially sabotage the British government’s bid to arrest him.Whether you think Assange’s role in leaking , classied US documents was espionage or heroism, it remains that he was also trying to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faced charges of sexual assault.How, pray tell, does that fit in with liberal values JENNIFER Lopez is  later this month and credits her youthfulness to daily “self-affirmations”.“I tell myself ‘I am youthful and timeless’ every day a few times a day,” she says. It sounds like cliched bull****, but it’s not. Age is all in your mind.”Hmmm. Quite frankly, I could chant her mantra on a loop and never look like this.One suspects that regular exercise, healthy eating and an expensive skincare regime have played their part too.A SMALL number of residents currently living in the swanky London area of Hampstead are up in arms at proposed boundary changes that would place their homes in nearby Gospel Oak.“By severing political ties, you’re disenfranchising many residents,” says one.What they actually mean is: The price of our houses will plummet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Crafty George Osborne, who was Chancellor  when a deal was stitched up, believed forcing the BBC to fund the leline would save the Government £million a year from . But the Treasury’s own watchdog yesterday revealed the move could backfire - ultimately costing more than it saves. The Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed spending on Pension Credit was set to rise because of the move to restrict free licences to only those who receive the benefit. Many who are eligible but do not currently take up the benefit are now likely to do so amid a planned advertising blitz by the BBC to raise awareness of entitlement, the OBR said.    The Department for Work and Pensions should be braced for a surge in demand for Pension Credit, it suggests. OBR chairman Robert Chote said it “illustrates the dangers of unintended consequences when governments come up with clever ways to save money”. Its fiscal risks report says: “DWP estimates there were around , people aged  or over who were entitled to the guarantee element of pension credit in - but who did not receive it, almost  per cent of the total number entitled. “These had an average entitlement of £ a week, resulting in around £.billion of unclaimed benefit among this age group.

Someone who denies what they appear to be, who professes to be one of the good guys working for a better world in which there just happens to be fewer of one sort of person, is harder still, because they simply refuse to be diagnosed.  Weaposre living in a world where absolutely everyone is racist. Donald Trump is a white racist. He says his critics are black racists. Jeremy Corbyn is called an anti-Semite. His supporters say Jews are Islamophobes. The comfortable, globe-spanning civilisation we lived in about  years ago has become a place filled with tribes who tell everyone  theyaposre in the wrong tribe.Thing is, the rest of the world has always been like that. Where the white enslaved the black, where those left behind warred with neighbours, where the Chinese now fight for control with Russians, where Nigerians or Australians or Venezuelans or Hutus or Tutsis are blamed for the remainder of problems. Itaposs just that now, everyone on the planet has the same madness. The Westaposs problem is not racism. It is that its tribe has shrunk - the us is no longer NATO, the United Nations, Europe, or the special relationship. Every tie that bound us into a larger group has been severed in a funding row of some sort, and the only tribes we have left are the ones we were born into.So a Jew who found a home in the Labour Party is now just a Jew. A Muslim whose values chimed with the Tories is now talking at mosque, not the constituency association. And a white Briton, like a white American, is ing to the past.Everyoneaposs going back to where they came from, and hates it.  Racism won when Donald Trump was elected leader of the Free World, that loose tribe we used to be members of. A man who said Mexicans were all rapists, who refused to let apartments to blacks  years ago, shouted at us until we were numbed. Like a patient whoaposs had too much electro-shock therapy, weaposre dazedly asking ourselves whether racism is really that racist.Because Trump says it, the same question is asked on radio phone-ins, on TV talk shows, in newspaper columns, pubs, workplaces, family dinners. The rest of the world is awful, says a tribe that doesnapost notice its own failings. Why donapost the awful people fix their awfulness  Thataposs pretty awful too, butyouaposre offended at that theyaposll be offended right back. For once, there really ARE good people on both sides, taking offence at the suggestion their tribe is less than perfect and the other might just be right.And now all of them are asking, out loud, what your ethnicity is, and comparing it to their own.   If tribalism was a good idea, weaposd all be happier right now. Africa would have been the most cheerful place on the planet for centuries, and the Labour Party would be thriving on its splits.But tribes make us smaller. Smaller in the head, in ambition, in influence and in power. A single building block cannot build a damned thing, and reducing ourselves to a unit of our birth is like evolution in reverse.We are at the edge of the swamp, looking at a place filled with things that slither and crawl, where there are no alliances and lots of death. A place where four legal citizens of a nation are called disloyal for wanting it to be a better place, where there are more guns than there are people, and where nutjobs call themselves a well-regulated militia able to gun down any target they choose.They forget that those who were dferent were the ones who survived the swamp. They grew fins and gills, then legs and lungs, and decided to live somewhere better.   If you are asked your ethnicity, there is only one answer. We are all % African. Thereaposs not a human on the planet who is indigenous aside from those who live in the Great Rt Valley of East Africa, and thereaposs no room for us all to go back there. Yet we introduce domestic abuse legislation that does not apply to migrants, and we free victims of human trafficking and send them right back to the places where they were enslaved. Trump is not responsible for the tribalism which has infected our race. Heaposs just ridden a wave which started in the  financial crisis, a wave similar to the one which started in the Great Depression and brought us the Nazis.But his praise of Nazis, his uttering of Nazi tropes, his constant ision of humans into smaller units, has enabled the same things to be discussed and done where in the world. Get rid of him, and America will have enabled the rest of the world to straighten its tie and tell the Nazis to shut up. Trumpaposs tribalism is useful. It will, one day soon, cause the USA to question its founding principles, reinvent its dream, correct the religious fundamentalism, slavery and narrow-mindedness with which it has been cursed for  years, and rebuild. That cannot, and will not, happen without Trump to kick against - evolution requires an existential threat.    When America unites, others will follow. Perhaps because tribalism just had its day, and perhaps because of coincidental global economic growth. But itaposs a matter of when, not , because innovation and improvement is inevitable in everything, except minds of hardliners in ISIS and the Republican Party.Death will come to Trump, one day, and maybe even the taxman. The voters will probably take him first, along with the financial realities of trade wars. If you ide your enemies, all you get is more enemies. Brexit is a dead end. Corbyn has nothing to do but fail. Putin, Duterte, Salvini, all aposstrong menapos rely upon tribes that do not question them, because they cannot withstand a question.When this tribalism dies - and it will - you must make sure to kill it everywhere. It lived on in Africa, Asia and the Pacic Rim because you left them behind, last time. Progressive is not an insult. Itaposs the only way forward, and everyone needs to move. We are not racist. We are the human race, a team of billions who all want to live somewhere better.

Julia said: “When I saw Eileen in person for the first time, I was just in awe of her because she is just the most gentle and lovely person ever.” But the couple have received hateful comments from trolls.    Julia said: “I think we get hate comments mostly because of the age-gap but also because we are gay and there are still a lot of homophobic people out there.” Despite their almost -year gap, the pair have learnt to not let the judgement from others bother them and their romance. And while Julia was singing at a gig in London, she proposed to Eileen. Eileen ed the question when the pair on holiday in Brazil meeting Juliaaposs mum, who is eight years younger than her new we. The couple, who live in London, have said they have received nothing but support from both their families.    The pair flew to Julia’s home country Brazil where they met Julia’s mother for the first time in December last year. Their genuine love won over family and friends and the couple decided to take the next big step – a le-long commitment to each other. The wedding ceremony took place at a -star hotel in Liverpool Street, in London on June . Julia wore an A-line white Maggie Sottero dress with Eileen also donning an elegant white, lace dress. Both brides wore a veil and dyed their hair bright pink.    Julia and Eileen were both in tears saying their vows during an emotional wedding ceremony. The brides weren’t the only ones who couldn’t hold back the tears. Wedding guests were also moved as the happy couple were pronounced as we and we. Before their wedding ceremony, Julia said: “My mom and my auntie and my best friend came from Brazil, I have an aunt that came from Germany as well and Eileen has some family and friends who are coming from America. “So we are super happy that quite a few people came from dferent countries for our wedding. We are very, very grateful they’re here.” Both Julia and Eileen couldn’t hide their excitement before the ceremony.    Julia said: “I know that she’s the one and she feels the same as well, it’s really wonderful. Eileen added: “Getting married is a big process. “It’s a really big business that you could almost lose sight of the thing you’re actually going to do. “And it’s really a very intense feeling so I ordered champagne.” Speaking of how she was feeling before the ceremony, Eileen said: “Really, really nervous and excited. I haven’t felt nervous like this in quite a while.”    Eileen admitted that she never thought of getting married. She said: “I think part of the reason for that is because I grew up in a time where for gay people it was never something that you even had the right to think about.” Eileen’s sister-in-law, Nancy De Freest, said: “The last thing I expected was Eileen to be married but I am so happy for her that she has finally found some happiness in her le.” She said that the age dference between Eileen and Julia at first came as a shock but added: “The age somewhat surprised me but knowing Eileen, she loves fun and she loves le. “When she told me about Julia it just seemed like that would be the perfect person for Eileen.”  Julia’s friend, Lara Sant ’Anna, who flew from Brazil to attend her friend’s wedding ceremony, said that Julia is quite a spontaneous person and added: “It’s not a surprise they are getting married so soon. “They love each other.

And the bride-to-be - who had previously changed her surname by deed poll during a relationship with the Statue of Liberty - has decided to seek a commitment ceremony to her chandelier known as Lumiere.    Whilst the Leeds native acknowledges that she canapost marry her love in the traditional way later this year, she is determined to prove her love exists - and is worth just as much as marriage between humans. Amanda said: Iaposm determined to have this commitment ceremony, to prove that Iaposm here for Lumiere and that my love is going to last. I restore the chandeliers in my spare time so they can continue to interest people as they like to be the centre of attention, thataposs what they like and its the energy I get from them. Iaposm not sure what dress Iaposll wear and will invite those closest to us. Iaposll also be buying matching wedding rings for Lumiere and myself. I know a lot of people think my attraction to chandeliers is strange, but Iaposm not crazy. I have been polishing Lumiere most nights to ensure she looks her best too.    When in a relationship with aposLibbyapos otherwise known as the Statue of Liberty, Amanda struggled with the long distance and turned to her chandeliers. And whilst Lumiere is now the true light of her le, Amanda still holds a candle for Libby, having adorned her house with memorabilia celebrating the New York native.

Amanda said: Lumiere was originally aposbornapos in Germany  years ago, and is in wide. She first caught my eye when I stumbled across her on Ebay - I had no idea she was my soon-to-be we. I spent £ shipping her over from Europe and it really was love at first sight.    As soon as Iaposd seen her, I couldnapost stop thinking about her and how beautul she was - she has such a beautul shape, and I could feel really amazing energy coming from her. I knew there and then she had to be mine. Lumiere and all of my chandeliers have their own special personalities. Lumiere is too big to take to bed with me, but she doesnapost mind when I spend time with the others. Some objectum sexual people believe that their partners talk to them, but I know that Lumiere communicates dferently.

Rachael was suffering from a rare sleep phobia, which developed after her two young sons were diagnosed with autism. Craig, Rachael’s husband, was in the armed forces and often worked away from home. And when he wasn’t there, Rachael would spend night after night wide awake. “I was terried thatI died in my sleep no one would find me or my ­children, and they wouldn’t be able to get help. “I’d worry about whether they’d survive until their dad got home.”    Often, Rachael would lie awake until am, only nodding off for a few minutes before her children woke up. “I was exhausted. But I was too afraid to let myself go to sleep and I thought that at leastI was awake, I knew I wasn’t dead.” Rachael is mum to Christopher, now five, and Jacob, three, who are both on the autistic spectrum, and Matthew,  months. Christopher was about six months when Rachael realised something wasn’t right. He didn’t want to be cuddled and would have uncontrollable meltdowns. He also had seizures where he would stare into space for minutes at a time. Eventually Rachael sought help from her health visitor and, after many tests, Christopher was diagnosed with autism when he was two. Rachael knew early on that his brother Jacob was just like him. “Jacob was only eight weeks when I realised he was autistic because he didn’t copy me when I poked my tongue out. He didn’t even look at me and I just knew.” Determined her boys would get all the help they needed, she read every bit of research on autism she could get her hands on and arranged portage training in her home, a type of early intervention therapy that develops learning in small steps. “I was % committed,” she recalls. But when Rachael was  weeks pregnant with Matthew, everything started to get on top of her. Craig, who had transferred to the Grenadier Guards in Aldershot, was retraining as a mechanic so he could eventually spend more time with the family. But this meant he would be away for a year, leaving Rachael alone. It was then that the sleep phobia really took off and before long Rachael says she was “like a zombie”. “The tiredness made me feel I was going insane. I was a mess. I was trying to keep everything together during the day and it all came out at night. Inside I was at breaking point.”    Rachael’s anxiety ­worsened and she became convinced she was ill. “If I had discomfort in my stomach, I was sure it was cancer. If I was anxious, it was a heart attack. Leg cramps were blood clots. “I lost weight when I was supposed to be gaining because I was pregnant. I was torturing myself, I was so desperate to stay alive. Sometimes I’d think ‘ anything is wrong with me, let it happen quickly as I can’t cope with this any more’. “I made sure everyone  was OK but I got lost and forgot about me. The doctor’s receptionist recognised my voice because I was calling the surgery so often.” Eventually, Rachael realised she had to get help and she booked an ­appointment with her doctor “I said, ‘I know it sounds crazy but I’m terried of going to sleep at night’.” Therapist Russell Hoyles, who works at Fairfield Independent Hospital, St Helens, Merseyside, says: “Sleep dread or somniphobia is a sleep disorder associated with anxiety and fear around going to sleep. Trauma, frequent nightmares, sleep paralysisand fear of something bad happening while you sleep, such as burglary or fire, are all recognised triggers. “Sufferers often feel distress and even panic as it gets closer to bedtime and can experience physical symptoms such as tightness in the chest and hyperventilation.“Even when a sufferer does sleep, the quality of sleep is poor and fitful, which has a debilitating impact on day-to-le, emotional wellbeing, concentration and relationships. “The number of sufferers is hard to quanty, but we do know a signicant proportion, at least a third of the population, experience some type of sleep disorder.“Indeed, one of the most common, insomnia, can develop into ‘sleep dread’, especially when the insomnia is related to a physical condition. “Treatment depends on the inidual but starts with good sleep habits such as avoiding caffeine before bed.“Medication can help with the symptoms but understanding and devising strategies to address the problem using talking therapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy, counselling and relaxation can also help.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jet2 passenger who led raf","story":"NewsJet passenger who stormed cockpit and shouted Ill kill you all gets £, billChloe Haines was arrested on suspicion of assault and endangering an aircraft after shaken passengers claimed she screamed “I’m going to kill everyone” during the mid-air rampageShareByMartin Fricker:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video exclusive-jet-passenger-arrested-stansted-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA female holidaymaker who allegedly tried to storm the cockpit of a packed Jet plane has been slapped with an £, bill by the airline.

Jill Sharp tormented Maggie and Steve Paton, from Livingston, Scotland, with death threats and lies over Facebook . Sharp used a fake account to hound the couple, while at the same time pretending to be Maggieaposs best friend in person, the Daily Record reports. She targeted Maggie and Steveaposs friendships and even tried to get them sacked from their jobs. After Sharp , , was sentenced to a year in jail, the couple told how the stalkeraposs only motivation seemed to be jealousy at their own happiness as they settled into a le together.    Maggie, who has written a book about her ordeal, told the Daily Record: “She was absolutely relentless and merciless for four years and it seems hard to believe that we were taken in by her for so long but I trusted her. “I would tell her that we were being stalked and ­terrorised and she would give me counsel and pretend she was supporting me.    “But all the time it was her that was twisting the kne.” Maggie became best friends with Sharp after they met via a network of Rangers FC fans in . She said Sharp homed in on her and ­cultivated an intense friendship. But after Maggie fell for husband-to-be Steve a year later it set off a jealous rage in Sharp that fuelled a four-year vendetta. Sharp created a fictional Facebook persona, with fake photos, to hound Sky TV worker Maggie, , and surveyor Steve, , sending them death threats and spreading vile lies about them to their family members, places of work and a golf club. As the couple’s love blossomed, Sharp became obsessed with wrecking their happiness, even contacting Steve’s teenage daughter to spread lies about him.    Sharp created a fake fiance of her own, stealing the identity of Graham McQuet which she found randomly on Facebook before renaming him Graham ­Alexander. Maggie said: “Steve and I were a real item by  and Jill must have felt insecure but the real abuse started the next year. “Around May , she invented another fake person, a boyfriend called Graham who became a fiance. I was delighted for her. “She started going on and on about this guy, supposedly going on romantic breaks all over the place, with photos to prove it.” Sharp was doctoring photos to make out she was enjoying breaks with “Graham” using pictures stolen from the real-le Graham McQuet.    She copied a picture from ­Facebook of him at ­Westminster Abbey then travelled to London for a similar photo before photoshopping them on Twitter to make it look like they were there together. Sharp, who lives with her mum and dad in Airdrie, sought to outdo Maggie, who was oblivious to the fact her best friend was wrecking her le. Maggie said: “She was always going on about ‘Graham’ and we were always on the edge of meeting him but he always had a personal calamity the day before and never turned up. “One day we were meant to be going on a hill climb but the day before she sent a photo of his ­supposedly sprained ankle.” Maggie added: “She was playing out the role of Graham on a separate mobile, texting me and talking away like we were mates.    “Another no-show came when Graham was going to pop the ­question at Ibrox and Ally McCoist had agreed to call Jill out of the crowd for the big moment. “Of course, Ally pulled out at the last minute due to other ­commitments, so it never happened that day either and I never got to meet Graham.” Jill and the fake Graham also used smutty text messages to boast about a fictional wild sex le. Maggie said the fantasist was “utterly obsessed with someone who didn’t exist”. It was after that phoney romance was revealed in the Record that Sharp was exposed and was arrested by police. She told them she targeted Maggie and Steve to get revenge because she suspected them of exposing her for the McQuet charade. But the tyranny had gone on for four years before then and “Graham” wasn’t the only fake persona Sharp had invented as a “Gemma Stuart” had harassed her on Facebook.    Maggie said: “Jill said from the start that she didn’t think Steve was good enough for me. “This Gemma kept on with the same stuff but she started befriending friends and family and telling them we were drug dealers and scumbags. “I had to get off Facebook but I then found out she was contacting both my work and Steve’s, telling them the same lies. This Gemma Stuart was ­threatening to do violence to us and let it be known that she knew where our season tickets were at Ibrox. “We had to have our seats moved three times. Eventually we had to give them up, so she drove us out of Ibrox.” Sentencing Sharp at Livingston Sherf Court on Tuesday, Sherf Douglas Kinloch said: “For more than three years you conducted a campaign against them in a calculated and deliberate attempt to ruin their lives.

KLM India tweeted the answer before deleting it  hours later, followed by an apology after receiving backlash. They claimed the fatality rate for those sat in the middle of the plane during a crash is the highest. They added that the safest seats are at the back. The tweet said: According to data studies by Time, the fatality rate for the seats in the middle of the plane is the highest. However, the fatality rate for the seats in the front is marginally lesser and is least for seats at the rear third of a plane.    It featured an image of a lone seat perched on a fluffy cloud with the words: Seats at the back of a plane are the safest! Their information is understood to have been based on an article published by Time magazine in . The publication stated that the analysis found that the seats in the back third of the aircraft had a  per cent fatality rate, compared with  per cent in the middle third and  per cent in the front third. But social media users were quick to hit out at the dutch airline over the inappropriate tweet. One said: Besides the tweet which was in very poor taste, your statement also wasn’t a fact because there’s just not enough datato make that assertion. So, it was in poor taste, and also misleading, for what it’s worth.    Another added: First women can’t breastfeed on you flights then you tell folks where they are likely to die on your planes in the event of a crash. Someone in Amsterdam needs to rethink your social media team. I love KLM, but I am beginning to wonder. A third said: The post has been deleted, but the damage has already been done! I’m supposed to fly home tomorrow! In response, KLM shared an apology and said: We would like to sincerely apologise for a recent update. The post was based on a publically available aviation fact, and isnapost a KLM opinion. It was never our intention to hurt anyoneaposs sentiments. The post has since been deleted.

After taking her away, Free drove her to secluded bushland, where he carried out the horror attack. Around an hour-and-a-half later he took her back, and CCTV footage showed her going back into the Kmart alone and looking for her mum. By that time police had been called.

I’ve been here before and won - with a last-minute winner, so you just take it, you take the win and get up the road.”Robbie was pleased to see winning goal scorer Butcher back in the starting line-up for the first time since he tore a groin muscle during May’s play-off games.Having handed starts to Louis Appereand Logan Chalmers , he was pleased with their contributions as well.“Calum gives us that stability we’re looking for in there. I thought Ian Harkes did well there as well and Sam Stanton did very well when he came on.“I thought the kids did well. Like many kids, their decision-making is something they can get better at, but both had good moments in the game.“They have worked hard during the close season, so they deserved the chance to come in and there are a couple of other young ones in the background who will get game time in the coming weeks. The future is bright for the place.”After drawing at Hearts in their opener, United are now sitting on four points in Group A, a point behind the Jambos.With home ties against Cowdenbeath on Friday and East Fe next Tuesday to come, they are looking good to progress as one of the second-placed teams with the best record.“All in all it’s been good. Three points from this one and we’re sitting with four points after the draw at Tynecastle and a hard game here.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

by its current pharmacies.The committee also stated that there was too long a wait between the Consultation Analyst Reportand the hearing as over a year had passed, which it felt rendered the findings out of date.Representatives from the current Tranent pharmacies ndash Lloyds Pharmacy and Well Tranent, both on High Street ndash were present at the committee hearing and both claimed that they had already addressed any issues that were raised in the consultation and therefore problems raised by the CAR were no longer applicable.There was also a question over whether the premises planned for the new pharmacy at  Bridge Street would be large enough to support the planned two consultation rooms and dispensary area, which the committee felt raised the issue of whether appropriate confidentiality was possible.Letters of support for the pharmacy were submitted by Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council and ward councillor Kenny McLeod among others however, the committee felt that none of these letters ldquospecied needs which were currently not being met.Pharmacy applicant Niamh Morrison visited the community council to thank members for their support over the process and to assure them that she would be launching an appeal.She said: ldquoI am of course very disappointed.ldquoI really believe that this community needs this, and I have developed a real soft spot for the

Irsquom very disappointed.ldquoTranent surgery is not unique in its problems and the pharmacy could have added extra services within the community.David Forrest, chairman of the community council

Wherersquos the reward of winningit comes so easily there was never any contest in the first place  You can only have a championhe or she has had to do battle against a worthy rival. Why would the likes of Rafa Nadal or Williams spend so many hours practising, improving, and perfecting their gamethe threat of being beaten was not ever-present The near hysteria of our culture when celebrating those who reach No.  seems predicated on ceaseless success. Organisers of childrenrsquos sports days who insist everyone is a winner, and nobody should ever be stigmatised as finishing last, are doubtless well-intentioned. Yet in the long run, donrsquot they do more harm than good  All of us know, from an astonishingly early age, that we are better at some things than others. We donrsquot expect to be first in everything ndash some of us donrsquot expect to be first in anything. From the offset, nature seems to train us to accept a hierarchy of ability. First-class cricketers are not necessarily so adept at maths or art or baking a sponge. Those who are not especially good at any subject often go on to show they are every bit as valuable to society as the whizz-kids, and sometimes a great deal more.Read more: Menopause ruling is another huge win for womenrsquos rightsTo counteract the hype that goes with triumph, we must pay attention to its counterpart, and learn how to fail well. In whatever area you name, publicly falling short of a goal is something all of us will experience. Whether itrsquos not getting a job, or losing an election, getting on to a prize shortlist but tripping at the last hurdle, there is only room for one victor in every competitive situation. Since statistically we are likely to fall short more often than we win, we should be given guidance in how to cope. I donrsquot mean we should expect failure ndash though Presbyterianism offers a first-class DIY course in defeatism ndash but that we should be taught how to handle it. And by that I donrsquot mean denial.Listening to sports figures, politicians, or business leaders finding positives even when theyrsquove been trounced, is almost a sport in itself. It seems the very thought of not being the best has been brainwashed out of all competitors lest it influence their performance. Surely, though, we need to embrace coming in second place, or lower, in a healthy way  Defeat is to victory what day is to night, but to live in perpetual sunshine is unsustainable and, frankly, unthinkable.Phil Neville, coach of the England womenrsquos football squad, was refreshingly unafraid to discuss the f-word. He did not want an open-top bus parade when the team ed home after coming fourth in the World Cup. That, he said, would be to celebrate failure. He now wants the team to focus on learning how to win. Hersquos absolutely right, yet one hopes that this process will include a dose of realism, a cushioning of expectations, that allows for coming up short without a crisis of self-belief or losing face.Federerrsquos reactions after the final were a lesson in precisely that. He acknowledged that he and Djokovic had both had their chances to win, and he had blown his. Will those elusive championship points haunt him  How could they not  Yet while he will relive those moments, and wince at letting the trophy slip from his grasp, a sportsman of his calibre will have learned to be resilient. The number of grand slams top tennis players have under their belts is repeatedly trumpeted, but yoursquore never told how many they crashed out of. Matches that didnrsquot go to plan are airbrushed, asfans donrsquot want to know about the bad days.

Their chances of getting through the first round, indeed, could be summed up by a picture of a spherical object made of ice being flung into the fiery maw of hell.When asked to respond to US President Donald Trump telling four congresswomen on Sunday to ldquogo back to their countries ndash three were born in America, the other arrived as a child refugee ndash both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, like Theresa May, criticised the presidentrsquos comments but pulled back from calling them racist. Mr Hunt thought it was not helpful to use that kind of language about the US President. In other words, donrsquot say what you see. Wrap your measured, liberal response in pretty paper and tie it up with a silky ribbon. That will show him.: Why Iain Macwhirter is lookingforward to a Johnson premiershipThe House of Representatives did the necessary, prompting the President to double down by declaring he did not have a racist bone in his body. If only an X-ray could pick up such things. Even then there would be some running shy of the diagnosis. It was left to George Conway, husband of Trump aide Kellyanne Conway no less, to say it like he saw it. In a piece for the Washington Post, Mr Conway, a lawyer, wrote that he had thought the President boorish, dim-witted, inarticulate, incoherent, narcissistic and insensitive. ldquoNo matter how much I found him ultimately unfit, he added, ldquoI still gave him the benefit of the doubt about being a racist. But Sunday left no doubt. Naivete, resentment and outright racism, roiled in a toxic mix, have given us a racist president. I think we have a winner in this particular round of Catchphrase.Mr Trumprsquos aim is as brutally simple as it is ugly: make the  election about race, because it worked in . As for the aftermath, a country even more ided than it currently is, donrsquot worry about that for now,you ever do. This is not a clever political strategy but a failure of leadership on a breathtaking scale.Failure of leadership is not confined to Republican presidents. Inyesterday,  Labour peers laid the same charge at Jeremy Corbynrsquos door for his negligence in tackling anti-Semitism within the party.ldquoYou have failed to defend our partyrsquos anti-racist values, said the advertisement paid for by the peers. ldquoYou have therefore failed the test of leadership. Quite the eyebrow scorcher. No wonder Theresa May brandished it at the Labour leader during PMQs yesterday.: Suspension of parliament being consideredIt was notable that the signatories to the letter mentioned the Panorama whistleblowers, the former party staff who defied non-disclosure agreements to speak out. Almost all of them were young and at the beginning of their careers. They were risking a lot, and the strain of dealing with so much hate, and seeing accusations filed away with zero action taken, took its toll. Several found their mental health suffering. One contemplated suicide.It was left to these youngsters, as it was left to the four congresswomen in the US, to make a stand against, and to suffer the consequences of, other peoplersquos failure to lead. The older, the wiser, the more experienced and powerful, might come along in time, but they could not be counted on.Accepted wisdom has it that we are living in the era of the populist strongmen. The Trump, the Orban, the Putin, the Duterte. How did it happen  Because as societies we were seduced by the notion of simplicity. Le was busy and stressful, the political problems we faced were complex and seemingly intractable, the pace of change was unrelenting. Along came people who said they had the answers. Who said donrsquot listen to those so-called ldquoexperts who tell you things cannot be done. Who promised to sort things out because it was all very simple, really.: Easier to believe lie than seek truthThe phenomenon was not the sole preserve of the seemingly strong, or men. It was Theresa May, after all, who coined the phrase ldquoBrexit means Brexit and look at the chaos she unleashed. Nor is it only to be seen on the right. Mr Corbyn, or rather his closest aides, operate like a collective strongman, treating any criticism as an attack that must be crushed.There are indeed answers to societyrsquos ills, and at heart we know what they are. Homelessness  Build more houses, and tackle the deep rooted problems that brought the person to sleep on the streets. Itrsquoll cost you, and it wonrsquot be easy. End child poverty  Not cheap, and it will take time. No NHS waiting lists  Open your purse and expect a wait. Save the planet  Extremely expensive, as well as a pain in the backside. So much easier to believe in the simple answer or turn the other way.One would like to think the pendulum was about to swing back, as people began to see that this drive for simplicity was exacting its own price, whether it be in ever widening inequality or worsening social stre. But then this time next week, barring an upset, we will witness Boris Johnson becoming PM. Mr Johnson is a king among Simple Simons. This is a man whose answers to problems are so snappy they can fit on the side of a bus. A man who oozes laziness, who reeks of the quick fix that turns out to be the bodge job, who changes his position to please whoever he is speaking to at the time.The irony is that far from being strong, what all these leaders have in common is their weakness, and that will begin to show itself when their fortunes change.

As it stands, society is not ready for the redistribution of species, as current policies and agreements are not designed for these novel species and ecological communities ndash particularlythose species have no perceived valueto society.ldquoOur results suggest that many species are on the move in the UK, and that we can expect a lot of changes in the type of nature we will have around us in the coming years. ldquoBut the lack of an integrated national  dedicated to tracking and communicating about species displaced by climate change is currently a hindrance to mitigating those potential ecological, economic and societal associated impacts.Nuthatches are not the only bird on the move.

Art should tell you truths you didnrsquot know or were too scared to learn. Art should make you feel awe, pity, wonderment. It should renew you and nourish you.

Brown provides prettiness and safety. Itrsquos a warm bath, and thatrsquos not art. Brownrsquos work is home decor, interior design. Itrsquos meant to make your living room attractive, not to touch your soul or change you.The irony is that while Brown may not be creating lsquoartrsquo, hersquos certainly reflecting culture.

To wonder what people see in paintings like McCoo ndash to suggest money may be better spent on a good print from an art store ndash is to risk being labelled an elitist snob. What could be worse in our cosy anti-intellectual society But Brown should be subjected to scrutiny as he affects Scottish culture and how itrsquos perceived. His images of cows with Saltires on their horns are seen by the world as saying something about Scotland. To me, it risks saying that wersquore a sentimental and frivolous people.

Desertication, famine ndash all of it was there, all of it looped back to the environment and the way the climate was changing. It made sense to me that it was all linked.Fast forward a decade and Nyberg is studying law at the University of Aberdeen. ldquoI watched a video about a man who turned an Eritrean desert green by flooding it with sea water, he explains. ldquoThat was the lsquojumping off pointrsquo for me. It was a simple idea that solved so many problems at once ndash it helps carbon capture, fights climate change, creates valuable wetland eco systems from degraded land on our coasts, creates jobs and provides food.The -year-old, who lives in Glasgow, adds: ldquoI knew right away it was what I wanted to do.Nyberg is the founder of Seawater Solutions, a multi-award-winning Scottish start-up company. By developing a number of ways to grow salt-tolerant cropson degraded coastal land for food and bio-energy production, he is revolutionising farming here in Scotland and abroad.Modern agriculture and climate change have resulted in farmland being degraded and made useless. ldquoAround the world, more than % of land has been degraded. If we grow salt-tolerant plants in these areas, we can produce enough food to feed the world and can produce substantial amounts of bio-fuels.The companyrsquos first projects are erse: the UKrsquos first salt water farm in Ayrshire and an integrated aquaculture pilot farm in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, which has introduced saline crops into existing shrimp farms, mitigating pollution.Projects in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Senegal are next and Nyberg hopes more will follow. ldquoThe Ayrshire farm is our flagship UK project, he explains. ldquoWe are using renewable solar irrigation systems that irrigate coastal farms with nutrient-rich seawater, naturally fertilising saline crops without the need for chemical fertilisers or pesticides.Introducing saline agriculture for a greener futureldquoSo instead of potatoes, our partners introduce high-value crops such as samphire and sea lavender by replicating the wetland environments where they naturally occur. This creates natural defences along Scotlandrsquos coastlines that tackle erosion, storm surges, marine pollution, and threats from rising sea-levels.The company is also working with Scottish Natural Heritage and local wildle trusts to introduce plants which can lsquotake awayrsquo pollution and create places for insects, birds and sea creatures to thrive.Nyberg adds: ldquoI wanted to look at how this could be applied to dferent areas around the world. In Vietnam, for example, the shrimp industry is hugely polluting and I wanted to negate the need for chemicals. The plants we are using bioremediate, they filter out the waste and chemicals themselves. ldquoWersquore conducting market research into other uses for our plants, such as animal fodder, oils for cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, and vegetarian food supplements for a growing market in South Asia.The company has launched a pilot trial in Sri Lanka, where hundreds of thousands of hectares of arable land have been destroyed because of rising sea-levels and the lasting impacts of the destructive tsunami that affected many countries in South Asia.Nyberg spent a year planning to launch the company during his Masters degree in environmental engineering at Strathclyde University. ldquoI wanted to look at how we could apply this to areas around the world, he explains. ldquoThat year at Strathclyde was perfect as it helped me to understand how I was going to do it. Irsquom very grateful for the support Irsquove had from Strathclyde and from the Royal Bank of Scotlandrsquos Entrepreneur Accelerator programme, which was invaluable.The programme, funded by RBS, provides benefits such as : coaching, access to business mentors and legal and technical advice from members. Nyberg is growing his staff ndash currently, there are four, supported by a team of interns working on research and development. ldquoWe all grew up together, mainly in Vietnam and somehow found each other again, he smiles.ldquoWe will be recruiting over the next few months and I am keen to collaborate with other like-minded start-ups too, for example in aquaculture.

While Britain is gradually becoming increasingly reliant on renewable energy ndash and recently recorded its second week without burning any coal for power ndash we cannot become fully green without making the grid smart enough to predict, prepare for and respond to the challenge of this irregular supply.A smarter, digital grid will have the flexibility to balance energy supply and demand, taking into account the intermittent nature of renewables, so reducing the risk of spikes and blackouts.This digital technology allows for two-way communication between energy suppliers and consumers, with smart meters creating a contact point in every home. They provide the grid with information to add more capacity when needed, change our electricity consumption patterns and make it easier to add electric vehicles , solar , wind turbines and heat pumps to the energy system.We all want an energy grid that is geared to the future, not to the past and to achieve big changes sometimes we have to start with small ones.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay.

In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmKirkwall Airport has been recognised for its high levels of service delivery and accessibility.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This has become more dficult with tightening data privacy legislation globally. The maritime world has been slow to adopt digital solutions and reluctant to embrace collaboration. We were very frustrated with the products available on the market being unable to offer a user-friendly but complete approach to industry-wide problems. Ankaa Marine was specically designed by seafarers for seafarers to offer the sector a simple solution.”Stuart Garrett, Serco’s managing director for NorthLink Ferries, added: “We never stand still and are always looking for ways to improve our operations. Usually this is for the benefit of our customers. But on this occasion, we’re pleased to be doing something directly for our staff, ensuring that we keep up with technology and bring the benefits of digital services to our unique workplace. This is a proven solution to something that affects every maritime operator and we’re proud to be in at the start of a transformation in crew management.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Michael Collins, Apollo ’s ­command module pilot, who watched on, fearful that catastrophe would intervene to ensure he would make theto Earth alone, played an integral part in the mission. So too did the many pioneers whose names occupy a mere footnote of history, despite the fact that without their expertise and composure, the disaster Collins feared – or much worse – would have almost inevitably come to pass. The semicentennial celebrations of the Moon landing is an occasion to remember those who occupy the foothills of the credits. One of the statistics surrounding Project Apollo, which seems to me both remarkable and entirely rational, is that around , people were involved in rendering the impossible possible.This army of engineers, scientists, programmers, mathematicians, and technicians defied technological limitations and bureaucratic wrangling to produce approximately five-and-a-half million parts which, working in unison, spirited Apollo’s crew to the Moon and back. : How moon landing conspiracy theories began and why they persist today – Professor Peter Knight:  years since the moon landing: why Scotland is the true home of astronaut Neil ArmstrongIn any other corporate environment, the prospect of workers on the ground feeling disconnected from the mission’s overall goal would barely warrant concern. But Project Apollo’s programme ­manager, George Müller, knew fine well the risks of letting such apathy go unchecked. He ensured the astronauts toured factories across America tasked with manufacturing the spacecraft components. This was no mere public relations exercise. It reminded workers that a single oversight on their part could kill the men standing before them, and it forged a sense of collective responsibility. Nowhere was this esprit de corps more evident than Building  of Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, home to the Apollo mission operations control centre , where the spacecraft’s ­navigation, propulsion, le support, and communications systems were monitored with unflinching ­scrutiny.At any given time, between  and  men – and one trailblazing woman, JoAnn Morgan, the instrumentation controller – held in their hands the lives of three men a ­quarter of a million miles away. Their number included Stephen Bales, the son of a janitor and a ­beautician, who less than five years previously had moved from the farming community of Fremont, Iowa, to join Nasa as an intern, responsible for guided tours. In an interview with  Minutes to the Moon, a superb BBC World Service podcast detailing the graft, ingenuity, and composure which underpinned the final descent to the lunar surface, Bales recently reflected on the mission that would define his career. Without him, it would have probably ended in failure. As the Eagle craft neared the Moon, an alarm code known as  flashed on its on-board computer display. It was the only moment in the entire mission when a degree of urgency,not fear, could be heard in Armstrong’s voice.Bales, by then one of Apollo ’s guidance officers, saw the alarm four seconds later. Initially unsure of its signicance, he remembered the last simulation he and the flight controllers had carried out before the landing proper. Back then a similar code, known as , had appeared, prompting Bales to call an abort. In the subsequent debriefing, he immersed himself in the myriad alarms that could be triggered, working with Jack Garman, a computer specialist, to understand their meaning.In doing so, they realised a  referred to a software reboot which cancelled all the processes that the computer was running crucially, it happened so fast, no vital guidance or navigation data would be lost. So when the code appeared for real, Bales knew the mission could continue. It was a decision made in the space of  seconds – “an eternity,” said Bales – but it saved Apollo . There are countless other stories like his. Take that of John Aaron from Oklahoma, the son of a cattle rancher and a minister, recruited by Nasa at  without an interview. He felt ashe had walked into a foreign country where people spoke another language, on account of the dizzying number of acronyms being hurled around. After just six weeks, he contemplated jacking it all in. Fortunately for him, and the Apollo programme, he knuckled down. Only a few months later, his split-second decision making was credited with saving Apollo  after its rocket was struck by lightning. It is dficult to conceive of the pressure these men worked under, as they analysed the spaceflight while listening to three,not four conversations simultaneously on communication channels known as ‘loops’.The average age of those inside MOCR was just , and as Gerry Grfin, the flight director during Apollo ’s fraught re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere, has pointed out, their youth counted in their favour. “It was the lack of fear,” he explained. “It wasn’t the lack of knowing it was risky.”It also means that, half a century on, many of them are still with us, able to reflect on an epoch-defining moment and receive our thanks for the part they played in it.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects.

If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again.

And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists!

Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal.

Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike.

Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38323328.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/porto.jpg","title":"portrush traders hoping for a longterm lift from open","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":null,"title":"scrapped bogside parking scheme blocks roll areas","story":"A Derry MLA has criticised a government department for its failure to deliver a Bogside residents’ parking scheme over the past decade.The comments made by SDLP MLA Mark H.

The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle.

It’s not just about me, there were many hundreds of families with stories to tell but maybe I told mine a bit more forcefully.”In the coming days a crane will lt the one-third scale replica of a Nissan hut into place which were originally constructed out of iron welded together and covered in corrugated tin sheets.In , over  residents from the camp marched on the city’s Guildhall to lodge their complaints about their living conditions with the leaders of the old Londonderry Corporation as part of a long running battle with the former local authority.Willie Deery continued: “There is a famous Derry Journal photograph from November  when women from the camp marched on the Guildhall in protest after a fire. The mother’s in that picture are all gone but we are going to recreate that photo with their daughter’s standing in the same formation as the original picture.”CAPTION: An artists impression of what the monument to Springtown camp will look like after its installed."},{"url":null,"title":"powys signs off gagging orders payoffs","story":"Powys County Councillor Jeremy Pugh\" Who signs off gagging orders and payoffs Head of Legal and Democratic Services and Monitoring Officer to Powys Council, Cltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtlive Pinneylt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"powys signs off gagging orders payoffs","story":"Powys County Councillor Jeremy Pugh\" Who signs off gagging orders and payoffs Head of Legal and Democratic Services and Monitoring Officer to Powys Council, Cltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtlive Pinneylt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod wells carnival 2019 hundreds","story":"The best overall float and winner of the Gordon Phillips Cup was Underhill Ridinltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtg Stables with the Pltspan classtruncate-full-screengtony Clubrsquos th Birthday celebrations also this year.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in ..

Ballynahinch is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular and we need to see work on the bypass starting as soon as possible, he said.Cllr Walker argued that the current congestion is hampering new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and believes the provision of the new bypass represents a ldquowin win for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down close in on last four  ","story":"DOWN camogs took another step towards qualication for the semi-finals when they blitzed Carlow at Pairc Esler on Saturday afternoon.The home side started in a hurry and stormed into a - to - interval lead, Carlowrsquos only scores coming from two pointed frees.Down were strong in all departments, but they had the star of the show in Portaferryrsquos Niamh Mallon, who helped herself to -, with only three points coming from frees.Mallon received great support from Castlewellanrsquos Sorcha McCartan who helped set Down on their way with a cracking goal in the th minute to put her side - to - clear.Mallon grabbed Downrsquos second goal just after the break and a double from Catherine McGourty was the icing on the cake as the Downmanagement team emptied their bench.The only negative on the day came when Sara Louise Carr had to leave the action in the first half with what appeared to be a calf injury and she must now be a serious doubt for the big game with Derrry on July .Down sit top of their group alongside Tipperary with Derry only a point behind and a win against their Ulster rivals would surely secure a place in the last four.Down -Carlow -ALL-IRELAND ICC.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C July 17%2C 1979  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN mdash Stormont officials were keeping tight-lipped this week about the prospect of finding new employment for  workers who have been dramatically paid off at two textile factories in the Castlewellan area.Redundancy notices went sent out last week to employees of the Moss Lane Spinning Company in Castlewellan and Standard Mills of Annsborough mdash but there is a chance they may be re-employedmoves to attract a new company to the vacated premises are successful.The official receiver, Mr Noel Stewart, who is the man heading the search for a new owner, said the two factories mdash operating as a joint company mdash had been plagued by ldquocatastrophic losses during the last  months.He stressed that he was optimistic that a new owner will be found and said the Department of Commerce had indicated that it will give every assistance to get the factories open again.A spokesman for the Department would only say that efforts were being made to get factories re-opened, but would not state the level of success.ldquoWe are trying to get another company to move into the premises at Castlewellan and Annsborough, but I am not prepared to say more than that at the moment, he said.Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill, slammed the decision to close the factories and said it was a disaster for the area.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted immediate action to cope with the grim unemployment problem facing the people of Castlewellan and Annsborough.ldquoThe overall situation was poor before this dramatic turn of affairs, but the close of these two factories makes the situation disastrous, he said.ldquoThere is now no worthwhile employment opportunity on any reasonable scale in the area.

The new owners are Mr Paul Green and his we Nancy, from Killinchy, and they have taken over the hotel from Mr Harry Briggs.The hotel was sold for an undisclosed sum of money, but it is believed to be in six figures. The new owners intend to extend and renovate the hotel, but hope that all work can be carried out without closing down the hotel.The short term plans include adding nine new bedrooms at the rear and extensively renovating the present accommodation.The owners intend to keep the present name for the time being, but they are contemplating reverting to the original name of the hotel, lsquoThe Treesrsquo.STRANGFORD mdash Shore sports proved every bit as popular as the sailing events at Strangford Regatta last week.Hundreds of holidaymakers flocked to the village to watch people of all age groups taking part in a host of events in the hot summer sun.The wide spectrum of events made it a day of fierce competition and fun for competitors and spectators alike and the organisers say they were amazed at the success of the sporting programme.Events included a fancy dress competition, round the houses race, rowing race and races for married men and women. Amusements were also provided for the children.PORTAFERRY mdash The Strangford to Portaferry swim was one of the highlights of Portaferry Gala Week, which began on Sunday and continues through until Saturday.The swim against the current, which is believed to be one of the fastest in Europe, took the most out of all eight competitors, who ranged in age from  to .But for Jacqui McIntyre, of Bangor Swimming Club, the swim proved comparatively easy.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Entries are now open for the  Deloitte Technology Fast  programme. The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years. Among the Northern Ireland firms making the last in previous years include First Derivatives and Novosco. A total of  firms from Northern Ireland made the list last year, with Belfast-based Repstor the highest-ranking Northern Ireland business at number  in the rankings. Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives. Shane Mulholland, senior vice president of marketing and operations at First Derivatives, said: “We’ve been involved with the Fast  programme since it began and have found it to be not only great recognition of every stage of the company’s growth but also a chance to meet peers and like-minded businesses who are striving to be leaders in their own fields.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/brexit_123234324234_web.jpg","title":"no deal brexit could cost ni  jobs","story":"Posted on Wednesday  July  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland faces losing , jobs in a ‘no deal’ Brexit which could have ‘immediate and severe consequences for its position as an all-island and UK economy, a government paper has warned.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
