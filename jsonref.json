So when temperatures are approaching 40 degrees, track temperatures can come close to 60 degrees. That causes the metal to expand, putting it at risk of buckling.The only way that Network Rail and train operators can respond is by imposing drastic speed restrictions, or cancelling services altogether, to avoid the risk of a train derailing from the misshapen track.Overhead electrical lines can also expand and sag, putting them at risk of being pulled down by trains.A third problem is that dry weather causes cracks, or even potholes, in the ground beneath the track. Trains travelling over such sections have to move more slowly for safety reasons.When Network Rail stress-tests its steel rail for its reaction to heat, it does so based on the mean summer track temperature in the UK, which is 27 degrees.In parts of Europe, and other hot countries, they assume much higher temperatures and manage their track accordingly.That can involve adjusting the track between seasons, to cope with extremes of both hot and cold. Another difference is that British tracks are typically mounted on sleepers whereas rail networks in countries with greater climate extremes use concrete slab, which can cope with track expansion and contraction. Concrete slab track costs four times as much to lay.Network Rail says it would not be cost-effective to build the UK’s tracks in the way they do in hotter countries because we don’t usually experience large variations in temperature.The most obvious solutions are train cancellations, which is one reason why train operators have been advising passengers not to travel if they can possibly avoid it.Another is to introduce severe speed restrictions so any trains that hit a section of buckled track are not derailed. Some services could be running as slowly as 20mph on particularly hot stretches.Network Rail has also sent out extreme weather action teams (EWATs) to monitor the line and, in some cases, paint parts of the track white. This can reduce temperatures by up to 10 degrees.As the world heats up, it is highly likely that the UK will experience more record-breaking heatwaves, meaning periods of rail disruption will become more frequent unless action is taken.Network Rail published its strategy for coping with the climate crisis in 2017. Among the questions it is considering is whether it might eventually become more cost-effective to spend money now on track capable of dealing with the heat, to avoid mounting costs of repairs and compensation for affected passengers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8811beddf257c6ae6b14103b4f0e098833489585/1029_638_3971_2382/master/3971.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4509e35da11eb12d7b29fb85d1c282a2","title":"the canal revolution how waterways reveal the truth about modern britain","story":"The remarkable transformation of canals worldwide is the ultimate symbol of how our cities have changed – for good and illEvery second Monday of the month, a small group of volunteers meets in the training room of a Birmingham supermarket. They discuss what has long seemed to many of their friends a crazy and probably doomed idea: how to excavate a contaminated 40-year-old waste dump, create an urban marina, restore three miles of derelict canal and build several new bridges and locks.Last month, however, the meeting of the 18-strong Lapal Canal Trust committee was joyous. After 20 years of trying to restore this short stretch of the 200-year-old Dudley No 2 canal, permission had finally been granted, they were told. What’s more, a feasibility study showed that the plan – which would link the suburbs of California and Selly Oak by water – could be a catalyst for nothing short of the economic and ecological renaissance of a large area of south Birmingham.The new canal will generate jobs but also provide space for new houses, as well as pollution-free walking, boating and cycling routes. The marina for 60-100 boats will stimulate businesses and bring in tourists. The wildlife corridor created along the canal will attract herons, otters, fish and waterfowl. And although the whole project will cost about £5m, the study said it would pay for itself in six years.“It will improve life in the city. It will complete an old canal loop around the city – we owe it to the future to restore it. We have support from business, the community, the university, developers and everyone. No one is objecting and we have nearly raised the first £250,000 – enough to start work,” says the Lapal trust CEO, Hugh Humphreys.Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.The Lapal plan is one of at least 80 canal renaissance projects currently making British towns and cities suitable for populations seeking tranquility, leisure space and new ways to move around. Just as canal-building drove urban growth in the 18th and 19th centuries by linking urban areas and stimulating trade, a new mania for canal developments is today reshaping cities by offering oases of calm in fastest-moving town centres.In Seoul, the renovation of the Cheonggyecheon Stream – an old sewerage ditch covered by a gigantic elevated highway that was torn down and restored with clean water, plants, wildlife and attractive landscaping – has been credited with reorienting the city (as well as sparking a property craze whose effects have not all been positive).But few countries have as many urban canals as the UK, a legacy of British industrial might – and now a golden opportunity for transformation. Some, such as the Aldcliffe yard development in Lancaster, will see just a few expensive houses built on old industrial canal works but many seek to create large new “liveable” urban communities in what were some of the Britain’s polluted places, such as Wolverhampton, Leeds, Manchester, Lancaster, Glasgow, Liverpool and Birmingham.Together, they are removing some of the last vestiges of the dirty old industrial urban economy and steering cities towards a future based on inner-city living, retail, leisure and heritage.Middlewood Locks in Salford, Manchester, was the site of an iron-rolling mill, railway sidings and goods sheds. It is slated now to become Manchester’s “most vibrant” inner-city area: a £700m canalside development of homes to buy and rent, with shops, nurseries and gyms.Equally, Hale Wharf in Tottenham on the side of the Lee navigation in north London, was the site of furniture factories, gunpowder and timber stores. Soon it will have 500 houses in a “canalside realm”.Britain’s most ambitious development is probably the Icknield Port Loop development, two miles from Birmingham city centre, where a massive 43 acres (18 hectares) of land between two of Britain’s oldest canals has been cleared for a new neighbourhood of 1,100 houses, shops and leisure facilities. Old pictures show Port Loop at the height of the 19th-century industrial revolution with belching chimneys, wharfs, saw mills and glassworks, set among fields. The first new homes are now selling for £380,000 and up.Regeneration of the canals on this scale was barely imaginable even 50 years ago. Unless they moved goods around, canals were regarded by government as polluted ditches, good only to be drained or filled in. Only the largest canals had survived the car economy. Anyone who took a boat out on the inland waterways for pleasure was considered eccentric.Three things unexpectedly changed everything. A postwar infant canal leisure industry emerged dozens of passionate heritage charities like the Lapal trust voluntarily restored many of the old waterways and water proved to be the vital ingredient to kickstart a new, property-based canal mania.“The restoration of the canals in the 1950s and 60s was thanks to a remarkable act of defiance by unpaid volunteers against the authorities,” says canal historian Mike Clarke.“Volunteers were vital. It’s unlikely there would be many canals today without them. The government, many influential people, and the British Waterways board, were all happy to see the majority filled in. But the volunteers challenged them and started to restore them without any authority,” says Clarke. “They told the government, ‘if you want to complain, take us to court.’”Government dared not take on the small army of volunteers, co-ordinated by the stroppy, infant Inland Waterways Association, the charity that since 1946 has promoted the revival of the UK canal system and whose members gave up weekends and millions of hours of free labour to dig out, restore and lobby for the country’s 6,500 miles of canal.“People had more leisure time, better education made them interested in their history, and the small English canals which had remained virtually unaltered for 200 years were of an ideal size for pleasure boats,” Clarke says. “They formed isolated stretches of peaceful country within the urban environment. Planners eventually saw them as an asset, and government at last understood their potential for leisure.”Once the canals were cleaned up and restored by the volunteers, regeneration followed. By the 1990s public funding from Europe and Westminster was unlocking billions of pounds of private capital. The result was that those polluted urban ditches, blocked off from the public and often filled with shopping trolleys and waste, became the bright new modern face of central Manchester, Glasgow, Bradford, Gloucester, Birmingham, London and dozens of other cities.And just as canals linked cities and shaped the way they grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, they are now shaping urban renewal today. Canals have never been more popular, says the Canal and River Trust (CRT), the government-part-funded charity set up in 2012 to take over and manage the 2,000 miles of state-owned canal formerly run by British Waterways. It calculates that about 10 million people a year visit the canals to fish, walk, cycle, observe wildlife or go boating.“There are now more licensed boats using the canals than at the height of the industrial revolution,” says a spokeswoman.In addition, canals have become a real alternative for people unable or unwilling to buy city property. The 100 miles of canals that run through London are now lined with vessels, and the city, with around 4,000 boats lived on by possibly 10,000 people, is thought to have a larger permanent floating community than Amsterdam with its 3,000 houseboats.“Waterside developments often lead to a reduction in the provision of mooring space for boats. When the CRT sells canalside space to developers the moorings often go. They are creating moorings for businesses but not for people”, said a spokesman for the National Bargee Travellers Association.“There is an acute and chronic lack of basic facilities on London’s waterways such as potable water taps, waste disposal facilities (for domestic waste, recycling, chemical toilets and motor oil), landside toilets and landside showers. For example there are only 17 water taps, 10 chemical toilet disposal facilities and 10 rubbish bins in the CRT Greater London region,” said the NBTA.“The CRT is trying to force us off the water and turn the waterways into a money-making business”, said one boater in London, who asked not to be named.This is disputed by Joe Coggins of the CRT. “There has been no reduction in moorings, but in a few isolated places we have given up moorings. We work with developers to keep moorings available.”“This is a golden age for the canals. We welcome everybody on them. There has never been so much demand for moorings and we try to find a balance between those who want to move around and those who want permanent moorings. It’s an acute challenge in London.”Canal development may have changed the face of cities but the quality of building has been patchy. The Gas Street basin in Birmingham city centre, which is the hub of a labyrinth of 200-year-old canals, wharfs, quays and locks, is now a corporate honey-pot, with restaurants and bars, civic buildings, luxury flats and hotels.Yet a few miles away the Black Country canals of Wolverhampton, Dudley and Walsall see few boats. Many of these old waterways are lined with semi-derelict warehouses, recycling and scrap-metal yards, bottling plants and rusting industrial lifting gear.Outside prestige city centre developments, many canalside buildings have been built with little sensitivity to either heritage or environment, says Smedley. Developers, especially in the 1970s and 80s, tried to cram in as many identikit houses as they could, and the result has in some places been an architectural mess with poor quality housing aimed at young professionals rather than families or the old, and low environmental or heritage value, she says.“Not all developments can be said to be good. A lot could have been much better quality. It’s getting better but mistakes were certainly made,” says Smedley.“The golden age of canal restoration was 20 years ago. Around the millennium, around 200 miles of canal were restored, many with EU and government money. Many old routes were reopened, urban canals were developed, and new canals linking waterways constructed. Now the money has dried up. Our concern now is that urban sprawl along them will destroy the rural areas between cities,” she says.Canalside regeneration has often led to gentrification and the takeover of places by the affluent. Wigan Pier, the semi-derelict site on the 18th century Leeds-Liverpool canal which George Orwell made famous in his 1937 portrait of northern living conditions, is to be transformed. In place of Orwell’s tripe shops and pubs, the council and developers plan a “multi-leisure” complex of gated townhouses, delis, a food hall, and a gin distillery.Certainly, restoration mania has given rise to tensions between developers and old-guard canal-users, and volunteers with developers accused of taking advantage of their voluntary work, says Mike Clarke. “Sometimes developers do things on the cheap which can cause upset. They see people on boats as easy targets to make money, charging them excessively. Sometimes they don’t recognise the heritage value of the canals. But they accept that development must happen.”“Almost unnoticed, the canals have become important sanctuaries for urban and rural wildlife,” says Simon Atkinson, head of conservation at the Birmingham and Black Country Wildlife Trust. “They effectively form a huge linear national park and are incredibly important wildlife corridors, very high in ecological value. They are like long ponds.”Otters, water voles, kingfishers, ducks, herons, fish, dragon- and damsel flies, even rabbits, are seen on the 100-odd miles of Birmingham canals, some of which are classed as local nature reserves. “There is more wildlife on these canals than there is in many industrial farming landscapes. There has been dereliction on these canals since the 1880s. It has led to opportunities for wildlife to take hold,” Atkinson says.“But we are at a crossroads. Water pollution has been largely stopped but planning can be weak and some places have been developed terribly, allowing wildlife no access to the water, no open spaces.“If development is done well, it can enhance nature. The canals have never been more important, but it could go the other way. There is a real opportunity for high quality inner-city development and nature to flourish together.”Back in South Birmingham, work is preparing to start on the first stage of the Dudley canal. Where it was once the dream of a few passionate people interested in urban heritage, today it is regarded by the city as an important link between the industrial past and the leisure-based future.“Many people still have no idea that the old Dudley No 2 canal ever existed, let alone that Selly Oak was a hive of Victorian industry,” says Hugh Humphreys.Their surprise – and probable delight – when in a few years’ time they find canal boats motoring past Sainsbury’s supermarket at a stately 4mph, and see otters and kingfishers at the bottom of their gardens, may just be worth the 200-year wait.The canal revolution series looks at what our changing waterways reveal about modern British cities.

Horse-drawn commercial boats carried goods along the waterways, and at one point the canal network carried nearly 40m tonnes of freight a year.Today, canals are being reclaimed as recreational spaces in densely populated cities – destinations for city dwellers to run, cycle and socialise.

The benefit was that on joining and becoming a “crew member” you were given – free of charge – a uniform. The disbenefit was that, on each shift, you had to wear it. The trousers were capacious, the top deep blue and white with a stripy pattern. This, according to HR magazine , was Ronald McD’s attempt to utilise “primary colours and pin stripes, in line with the tailored feel of the power-suit.” But even with the boat-shaped hat that made you look like one of the Tracy family in Thunderbirds, there really wasn’t much power in that outfit. And it wasn’t much of a suit. No wonder people dressed at work or arrived in outsized overcoats.I learned several things quickly. One was that in work as in life, there is a role for everyone: the key is how to find it. I did shifts deep-frying Filet-O-Fishes and frozen fries in enormous wire baskets. And I learned the hurried synchronicity required to make sure there was always sufficient fodder, and the adaptability to accommodate customers who jolted a system rooted in homogeneity by ordering bespoke.I did hot and gruelling shifts cooking the burgers required for hamburgers, cheeseburgers and Big Macs. A few of those was enough. The man frying the regular burgers, and it was usually a burly, manly man, was like the stoker shovelling coal into the furnace of a steam engine fast enough to reach Manchester by sundown. It all seemed very Victorian: and to be honest, I was never very good at it. The proof was a shift spent cooking Quarter Pounders, which were thicker and needed searing on either side to cook them in the middle. One day I forgot and watched as eight unseared Quarter Pounders – each minus a hefty bite – were returned by queasy, irate customers. Presumably they stopped by en route to A\u0026ampE.From such days and such occurrences, I learned that it’s best to match one’s specific talents to every shared endeavour. It helped that I was raised in a family where chores were non-negotiable, especially for me, the youngest member. Clean the windows, hoover up, wash down the paintwork and skirting boards, wipe down the kitchen cupboards. These were the sort of things that had to be done before the weekend was my own. And so applying the fact that I had always worked to buy the things I wanted – starting with a paper round at 12 which morphed into a job with a chain of newsagents – and that I had no inherent fear of a mop or broom, I gravitated towards the shifts spent keeping tables and the restaurant clean and clearing the nearby streets of McDonald’s litter.Trash collection was a local authority stipulation and a top priority. Clean restaurants, meanwhile, reflected the company mantra: incanted, and reinforced in the exams we took to obtain shiny star-studded crew hierarchy badges: “quality, service, cleanliness”.It was within this structure that I quickly realised that so long as the visible objectives were achieved: no one much cared where I was or what I did or how I did it. This served me well. I wrote the  Diary for seven years and the modus operandi was much the same.Others at McD’s found a measure of autonomy but, as ever, some pushed the envelope further than it was meant to go. One crew member, bin liner in hand, famously departed on trash collection and was missing long enough for her absence to become an issue. She was found, bag in hand, emerging from the cinema.As underlings in an operation of strict rules and hierarchy, we enjoyed such acts of insubordination. Senior bosses seemed benign, but middle managers, the NCOs, could be disagreeable types with more power than they knew how to handle or deserved. Discomfiting them became a pastime, and one sure way to do that, as the 1970s came to a close, was to utter a sentence, a little too loudly, containing the word “union”. McDonald’s did not like unions. And we enjoyed the camaraderie that can make even harsh and stressful working environments tolerable.I learned something about right and wrong there, and perhaps a little about interventionism. Working the tills, I gleaned that it was unspoken practice to give police officers free food, on the basis that if there was trouble in the restaurant, they would quickly come to the aid of beleaguered staff. But despite the close proximity of a station and the ubiquity of police patrols, the response was always wanting. In the aftermath of one such failure, having filled several bags of burgers, fries and apple pies for the officer dispatched to collect them, I smiled a unknowing smile and said: “That will be £15.50”, and watched a perplexed figure return to the van outside to collect the cash from his colleagues.And for quite a while afterwards, I learned how to watch my back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/373ec9a8e9ec60e7fabcb33c4bb2518469e6273e/782_108_6278_3768/master/6278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5af133e7be47937087600082f38f6422","title":"the guardian view on james lovelock earth but not as we knew it","story":"As a scientist (his first letter to Nature was published in 1945, on the subject of writing on petri dishes), Mr Lovelock’s life has been studded with insight. He invented an electron capture detector that could pick up minute traces of pollutants – such as the pesticides that spurred Rachel Carson to write the 1962 book Silent Spring. At home he built instruments that ended up on Mars, helping Nasa to establish that the red planet was lifeless.Mr Lovelock’s imagination has not narrowed, but his vision has become bleaker with time. His new book Novacene: The Coming Age of Hyperintelligence proposes that the 300,000-year Anthropocene era of Earth’s human domination is ending. Novacene is a new age where our species is doomed to a worse fate than clinging on for dear life at the north pole as previously imagined. Instead we will become lackeys of cyborgs able to think 10,000 times faster than humans. We will be kept on to ensure there are habitable temperatures for these superior intelligences.Novacene’s thesis is a straight-line extrapolation of Mr Lovelock’s breakthrough idea which he began to develop while a consultant at Nasa in the 1970s the thought that the planet was a superorganism. In 1974, he and biologist Lynn Margulis proposed the Gaia hypothesis, which holds that Earth is in some way alive. The paper suggested our planet metabolises and responds to changes in its environment to survive. In bestselling books such as The Revenge of Gaia, Mr Lovelock argued that humans have exploited Earth and the “old lady” would eliminate us unless we treated her with greater reverence. That is why the Novacene will start, he now reasons: because a superintelligence will recognise that all living tissue will be consumed by climate crisis and will act with Gaia to keep the life going.When it came out, the Gaia theory immediately chimed with the incipient green movement. Tough-minded scientists, though, initially reacted as if – as one critic put it – Mr Lovelock had let off a bad smell at the vicar’s tea party. Its appeal, they wrongly sneered, was to devotees of faith-healing and mysticism.But Mr Lovelock has stuck to his guns and refused to be co-opted by environmentalism. He backs nuclear power and has zigzagged on global heating, saying that some alarmist books – including his own – had made unwarranted predictions. He even told the : “We’ve got to really make it clear to those very silly people who think we can save the planet to cease and desist.” And what of the Gaia hypothesis? Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould described it as “a metaphor not a mechanism”. Its truth is poetic not literal. That echoes how Mr Lovelock sees himself. “I’m a romantic,” he said once. “I’m much more of a poet by nature than anything else.”He might be best seen then as a 21st-century William Blake – one whose words are no more testable than verse, but no less valuable for that.

Well, he’s a cousin-fucker.”During Mueller’s testimony, which saw him answer questions about the contents of his extensive two-year report on possible collusion with Russia, Bee said that he “looked like he aged 10 years”.She continued: “He gave his testimony with all the enthusiasm and passion of a recently fired basset hound. The only way Mueller could have looked less interested in testifying this morning is if he spent the testimony wearing glasses with open eyes painted on them.”Bee said that watching the live testimony was “like watching depressed paint dry” especially given that Mueller didn’t need to add anything to what he had already revealed. “Here’s the thing America, you didn’t need the testimony today!” she said. “If you’ve been waiting for evidence that Donald Trump should be impeached, you already have it. It is called the Mueller report.”And if people were still asking the same question?“The answer is yes, yes, he should,” she said. “We don’t need to force the world’s grumpiest law-daddy to read between the lines of his report when you could just read the lines.”On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert was also underwhelmed by the morning’s activities but learned to find pleasure in the small things. At one point, Mueller said that some of Trump’s behaviour was not just problematic but that the word would be an understatement.“Problematic is an understatement is a pretty scathing indictment for a man whose version of ‘I love you’ is probably ‘It’s safe to say there is some fondness,’” he said.Colbert said it was clear that Trump “welcomed the help of those who were breaking the law” and one Democrat asked Mueller if he worried that this would lead to the normalisation of this behaviour to which he responded: “I hope it’s not the new normal but I fear it is.”Colbert then joked: “It’s also the slogan for the new steak reaper ranch fries burrito”.On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah started by saying that Mueller’s 450-page report was “450 pages too long”.One of the morning’s most interesting moments saw Mueller revealing that Trump could be convicted of obstructing the law after he leaves office. “So you know what that means?” Noah asked. “Trump is never leaving office.”Throughout his time being interviewed, Mueller was often asked to read out sections of the report to which he consistently refused. “He’s like the world’s least co-operative audio book,” Noah said.He continued: “Poor Robert Mueller, man. The guy spent two years writing up an incredibly thorough document and now people are badgering him with questions he’s already answered. It would be like if Jesus came back and we spent hours asking him to explain stuff that was already in the Bible”On Late Night, Seth Meyers ridiculed Trump’s claim that he wouldn’t be watching the testimony since he watches “more TV than is medically advisable”.He’s also sure that Trump hasn’t read the 450-page report. “There’s no way Trump’s ever read anything that long in his life,” he said. “If he gets a fortune cookie, he hands it to one of his aides, saying ‘Just give me the gist.’”Meyers then ran through Trump’s unhinged Twitter activity that morning. “His tweets would make more sense if they were scribbled on paper and faxed to a newspaper under the Zodiac symbol,” he said.He found it strange that Mueller was constantly being asked to confirm paragraphs from the report that he wrote himself. “He already wrote down everything he knows,” he said. “It’s like if you called in Ernest Hemingway to grill him about one of his books.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa6faebb5203a815a218aa60b5f5ac8b9318fb26/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9105cd6dd0aede30f86a1c4c21c93ed2","title":"low carbon energy makes majority of uk electricity for first time","story":"Low-carbon energy was used to generate more than half of the electricity used in the UK for the first time last year, according to official data.The government’s annual “energy bible” confirms a string of record green energy records broken in recent years, as the UK undertakes more renewable energy projects and shuts down old, polluting coal plants.National Grid said earlier this year that the UK had recorded its greenest ever winter due to windy weather and dwindling coal-fired power.This followed the second greenest summer, which fell narrowly short of the 2017 record for renewable energy due to a long heatwave. Very hot weather can have a negative impact on renewable energy generation because high pressure weather systems can suppress wind speeds, and solar panels produce less electricity if temperatures climb too high.Only five coal plants will be left running by the end of the coming winter after SSE announced plans to shut its last coal plant at Fiddler’s Ferry near Warrington, Cheshire, in March 2020.Emma Pinchbeck, the deputy chief executive of Renewable UK, said the record-breaking figures “clearly show that investment in renewables and the government’s championing of offshore wind is delivering rapid change to our energy system”.“As well as helping keep prices down for consumers and boosting the competitiveness of our businesses, renewables are a huge economic opportunity, bringing employment and investment to all parts of the UK,” she said.The government threw its weight behind the offshore wind sector earlier this year by promising developers the chance to compete for a share of £557m of state subsidies in exchange for industry investment of £250m over the next 11 years.But ministers have refused to lift a block on support for new onshore wind farms, which are unable to compete for subsidies despite being one of the cheapest forms of electricity.“To achieve its net zero ambitions, the new government needs to go further and faster - and the first steps should be removing the barriers to onshore wind which is our cheapest source of power, and building on our successes in innovative technologies like tidal energy and floating wind where the UK can be a world leader,” Pinchbeck said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a3557c3c7001eb302d4da1e7f812bc3094da681/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06a972db03693234eeb2ccc84337d673 880w","title":"rutger hauer from blade runner to buffy the vampire slayer in pictures","story":"The Dutch actor, who has died aged 75, had a long career playing – mostly – villains and ne’er-do-wells, but his charisma and force was always apparent•Peter Bradshaw on Rutger Hauer: an icily elegant presence with a touch of self-aware drollery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c4424bd543271eb8f1ea8d24fdedc0343ce7841/0_25_1198_719/master/1198.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=716cde80e24f653810ddab1a15f40a7d","title":"daniele de rossi boca juniors roma transfer argentina","story":"Boca Juniors have confirmed the signing of Italian midfielder Daniele De Rossi, who has left Roma after 18 years at the club and joins the Argentinian side on a free transfer.De Rossi was received in the early morning at Buenos Aires’ Ezeiza airport and transported to have his medical done immediately. He is expected to join the squad for the first practice on Friday morning, and officially presented on Monday.At 36, many suspected the midfielder would retire as a one-club man when Roma did not renew his contract this summer. But rumours began to fly in May when at a press conference he said: “I still want to play football, it would be unjust to me if I decide to stop now.”Twitter fed that speculation after a picture of De Rossi holding up a Boca kit with his name and number did the rounds. And Boca fans began dreaming when De Rossi reportedly said: “I don’t want to stop playing with the regret of not being able to wear the shirt of Boca.”He will be Boca’s marquee signing of the current transfer window. It is likely De Rossi’s relationship with Boca’s sporting director, Nicolás Burdisso, helped the club seal the deal. Burdisso played at centre-back for Roma between 2009 and 2014. Boca also signed winger Eduardo Salvio from Benfica last week.The club’s manager, Gustavo Alfaro, lauded De Rossi and said “he’ll add his experience and quality”. De Rossi will be one of the older players in the side, but despite his age, his gritty style will fit in with the Argentinian league. He is a year older than Carlos Tevez, who left Juventus at his peak to join his boyhood club in 2014 after playing in the Champions League final.Argentinian teams are allowed only five spots for international players in each squad, but the prospective exit of Uruguayan midfielder Nahitan Nández to Cagliari, and Colombia-born Frank Fabra being granted Argentinian citizenship, have freed up room for De Rossi.Some remain skeptical of the Italian’s ability and will to perform at his peak, recalling Dani Osvaldo’s overhyped and underwhelming loan spell in 2015 from Southampton via Internazionale.Under Alfaro, Boca Juniors’ formation has varied, but with Tevez mostly sidelined and Cristian Pavón linked to an MLS move, Alfaro is likely to stick with the 4-4-1-1 they utilised against Athlético Paranaense on Wednesday.The formation leaves former West Ham playmaker Mauro Zárate in an advanced creative position, with two central midfielders behind him. Iván Marcone is first-choice, with De Rossi likely to rotate with the highly rated 19-year-old Agustín Almendra, adding depth to a squad looking to make a run for the Copa Libertadores.The Argentinian Superliga kicks off over the coming weekend, with Boca facing Huracán in their first game. De Rossi will get his first taste of a superclásico on 1 September, when Boca travel to bitter rivals River."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f994cd61d160471d3003e640efd60f471457b0e6/0_401_5500_3299/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23b27e1a42253aa941ece73df770f98b","title":"everton unveil plans new stadium liverpool docklands area","story":"Everton have revealed the proposed designs for their new £500m stadium to be built on semi-derelict dockland in north Liverpool, claiming the brick, steel and glass structure will deliver a £1bn boost to the city’s economy.Dramatic images of the proposed development were unveiled at a fan event at the Titanic Hotel, itself a former warehouse just yards from the Bramley‑Moore dock site where Everton intend to build their new home. Following a period of public consultation a planning application is expected to be submitted before the end of this year, and assuming approval is granted in 2020 a three‑year build is envisaged, meaning it would be 2023‑24 at the earliest before Everton move out of Goodison Park.The old stadium will be demolished once the Bramley-Moore project is up and running, though rather than sell the Goodison site to property developers Everton intend to use it as public space and for a range of community initiatives the club already sponsors, including a permanent memorial to the ground which has seen so much in its 127 years.One of the most striking features of the new 52,000-capacity stadium, apart from an unmistakable presence on the waterfront skyline, will be a steep bank of seats behind one of the goals. Unashamedly modelling itself on Borussia Dortmund’s Yellow Wall, Everton hope the 13,000-seat South Stand will take off in public imagination as the Blue Wave.As with seating in other parts of the ground, the stand will feature rail seats, which can easily be converted to safe-standing areas should legislation change to allow it in the future.There will be a tunnel club at the new stadium similar to the one at Manchester City, while the American idea of loge seating will be incorporated as part of the upper level of hospitality packages. The best seats in the house will be padded armchairs complete with dedicated television monitors.All four stands will be of equal height but each will be distinctive, the club say, and steeply pitched to bring supporters as close to the action as regulations permit. The brief given to the architect Dan Meis was to try to capture the intensity and intimacy of Goodison Park by keeping the distance between stands and pitch as short as possible.Everton are confident their present design will ensure spectators feel almost on top of the action, more so than at any other Premier League stadium, and trust something of a bearpit atmosphere will result.Some of the famous Archibald Leitch lattice-work from Goodison Park will be referenced in the brick base of the new stadium, which at ground level at least has been designed to fit in with its immediate maritime surroundings. At roof level the concept is a little more futuristic, with the use of glass and steel intended to create a modern landmark which will be suitable for concerts and events as well as football matches.Everton’s chief executive officer, Professor Denise Barrett-Baxendale, described the proposed development as a “game changer” for the club and the city. “This is an incredibly important milestone for both,” she said. “It is first and foremost a stadium for football, for our passionate fans and for our players, a stadium that gives Everton a platform for growth both commercially and socially. But it is also a stadium for the entire city and a development that will deliver transformative benefits in terms of regeneration for the whole region.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8b8d1b451ab189dd4d4788c8155647ddebd22da/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c1fe2afeec7ebd89258b130fe6c1031c 960w","title":"logan paul fastest youtuber vlogger richer","story":"After losing his way in Japan’s Aokigahara forest, the vlogger is back, bigger and richer than everA fearful realisation, but it appears that, in Logan Paul, the world may be in the presence of a genius. Is that genius good or evil? I have yet to decide. Logan Paul has yet to decide. We will only know one way or another when he explodes the moon as some sort of viral prank.For those of you born before the year 1998: Paul is a YouTuber, most famed among people who are allowed to portion-control their Ribena on the assurance that they won’t get too hyper on it (that means: you and, to a lesser extent, me) for the January 2018 video where he went to Japan’s Aokigahara forest, or “suicide forest”, and found and broadcast footage of a dead body there. You are not supposed to do that, it turns out. YouTube cut ties with him, Paul lost thousands of subscribers and commercial partners, and went to ground for a month before coming back with an apology video. And now he’s … hold on, bigger than ever? It’s hard to ever know what’s going on with YouTubers: they exist in a strange and fascinating liminal area of fame, where they are enormously, hugely, Beatlemania-famous to millions of people, but all of those people have curfews and intricate Proactiv routines and can’t legally buy scratchcards, so it doesn’t really count. If you have ever accidentally strayed into the wilds of Instagram and said to yourself: “Who is this teenager, and why do they have nine million followers?”, you will already know this. Logan Paul never stopped being famous to people who knew who Logan Paul was before he became The Infamous Logan Paul. And now he’s crossed over into the mainstream, again, briefly bobbing his head above the Actual Fame waters before dipping back down into the merch-and-a-podcast depths, and traditional media is baffled all over again. Thirteen-year-olds, as they always do, smile knowingly in the background.The latest prankexquisite worldwide Derren Brown-style mindfreak (delete as appropriate) was Paul’s appearance on Fox Business, which soon went viral, studded as it was with non-sequiturs about how fast he could run (“I’m the fastest YouTuber – I’m the fastest entertainer on the planet”), an outlandish bet to see if anyone could outpace him (“Yeah, I’m betting $100,000 that I’m the fastest man on the planet”) and his current health status (“I also have pinkeye”). For Paul haters, the video was a gift: that forest wanker, making a fool of himself on national TV! Like and retweet! For Paul’s fandom (the “Logang”), the video was endorsement of their lord, and the godly powers he holds: a deliberately erratic TV appearance designed to go viral and get coverage in the newspapers and websites of yore, those fusty old institutions that don’t understand him.As a result, Paul – who made $14.5m last year – is this weekend throwing The Challenger Games, where various YouTubers you have never heard of will compete in various track and field events for cash prize donations to local charities. It’s not the first time Paul has pivoted to athletics – he boxed fellow YouTuber KSI last year, in a PPV match that reportedly made them both millions. Once again: Paul is a machine designed to make money, no matter how hard and how publicly that engine explodes.It’s Logan that threatens me the most, though. The waterproof way he just bats off controversy. The casual, joking manner with which he makes vast amounts of money. His recent reinvention as a sort of athletic Howard Stern, fronting up the world’s number one podcast by basically burping and shouting into a microphone. The knowing way he manipulates the great old gears of media to do what he wants. It’s not a great push to imagine him, in 10 years, the first YouTube billionaire, heading up a Murdochian media empire, cackling atop a skyscraper built in the shape of his head. From then on, it goes two ways: Doctor Evil world destroyer, or four-term president. As my inevitable future employer and possible executioner: I wish you nothing but luck, Logan Paul. Nothing but luck and good energy.Alex from Glasto news now, and the cherub-faced viral star – he very much looks like if Justin Bieber got into aggressively shouting at you outside a Spar instead of having a multi-million dollar pop career – has finally released his debut song. What Ya Kno’ ’Bout That Bro? is an erratic two minutes and 37 seconds of Alex slowly boasting about wearing a hat and getting on stage with rapper Dave at Glastonbury, and how Thiago Silva now follows him on Twitter.What is the point? Well, it’s hard to know, but I have a theory. In wider culture we call this Ferdification, after clonk-headed mechanic Ferdi Mathew-George, the Albanian mechanic who last year got hit in the head with a bike so hard he released a song about it: taking a bit of viral currency, and trying to turn it, alchemy-like, into something, anything. Both Alex and Ferdi ed head first into the “waving in nightclubs” personal appearance scene. Both garnered huge semi-ironic social media followings. Both released overproduced videos with GRM Daily, where the line between “is this a pisstake?” and “is this … actually good?” became alarmingly blurred. Ferdi, for his sins, disappeared without a trace, I guess because saying “why you coming fast?” a lot and not really knowing where the joke is can only last so long. Alex, if nothing else, seems to have a faint idea that he needs to take every chance he gets while he can, just in case. If nothing else comes from this, at least he got a music video, Dave’s phone number and (I’m speculating here) a cornucopia of mucky DMs.Is What Ya Kno’ ’Bout That Bro? a good song? Absolutely no. Is it an earnest attempt to turn 15 minutes of fame into the best summer of one human bucket hat-cum-GCSE student’s life? Yes. And is it so mad to think that this can’t be a path to legitimate, actual fame, in these bizarre hot times we live in? Cardi B got her start doing sort of motivational speeches on Instagram, and look at her now. Lil Nas X managed to leverage a medium-to-large Nick Minaj stan account into making Old Town Road the biggest song of 2019. There is no normal path to fame any more, and we need to let go of the old beliefs that tell us otherwise. Alex from Glasto might be the only person who recognises the truth any more. He’s the only smart one left."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1218314f37b62c8998509de7f76ffb9519f5dfe1/0_23_1156_694/master/1156.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d76aef945923727e32ed5ac86575ef0e","title":"vice uk staff unionise and urge other online media to follow suit","story":"Move comes after four months of discussions and previous attempt three years agoVice UK has become one of the first British digital media publications to unionise, with staff urging other online-only media outlets to follow their lead while the industry is in turmoil amid financial struggles and job cuts.Bosses at the youth-focused publication decided to voluntarily recognise their staff’s right to form a negotiating unit, following four months of discussions involving employees and the National Union of Journalists.Ruby Lott-Lavigna, a vice writer who is to be the NUJ’s mother of chapel at the new unit, said: “It’s indicative of a wider change. We want to see repercussions across the new media industry.”The announcement comes three years after Vice UK bosses headed off a previous attempt to unionise by offering to set up a staff council. At the time the company was accused of engaging in an “old-fashioned union-busting ruse” by the NUJ.Lott-Lavigna said that while unions had previously struggled to appeal to young workers in the media industry, this attitude had changed. “It’s more relevant than it has been before, given the fragility and low pay.”The NUJ said they were in talks with other digital-only news outlets to form unions as workers became more aware of the difficulties that the industry was facing, with outlets closing as investment dried up.The NUJ will now negotiate with Vice UK over an agreement that will allow staff representatives to negotiate pay and conditions on behalf of the approximately 50 editorial and production employees at the company.Many online publications came to prominence in the early part of this decade by building enormous audiences on social media, attracting hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in the process. But this has generally failed to translate into profits, with Disney recently saying its $400m (£320m) investment in Vice is now essentially worthless.Many leading online US news outlets including Vox and HuffPost have already unionised. BuzzFeed US recently agreed to recognise its union following protracted negotiations, although employees at BuzzFeed UK last year voted to reject unionisation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6442f64d2ec39b3d8809eb3404a68b291f6fed1b/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e419822b3c5ccfeabdeedd567d6dc63","title":"hotels booking money taken deposit authorisation","story":"Hotels information assured us that nothing would be charged at this pointI used hotels to book an aparthotel in France.

It could be more worthwhile to save it for laterTaking a gap year after your A-levels has gone out of fashion. It could be down to bad PR, now that voluntourism schemes are widely considered self-serving. And then of course there’s the cost, which many students are avoiding in favour of microgapping for a month or two. “A lot of my friends take the mick out of me saying, ‘Oh, you went to Cambodia on a gap year,’” says Beth Adams, 21, who studied politics and international relations at the University of Manchester, and took a year out after graduating. “You do feel like you’re fulfilling a stereotype a bit.”“Definitely,” says Mathilda Frampton, 22, who graduated last year and has done a series of internships in film and theatre alongside a paid childcare job. “When you’ve been in education for all those years, where your life is September to July, a break is a good idea. I’ve had time to figure things out and a year of being able to work on different projects. As a result, I’ve just got a job in the film industry.”Although some take a gap year after university because they have a job lined up and managed to delay their start date, most are yet to secure work and are biding their time. It’s a common misconception that those who don’t secure work straight out of university immediately go abroad to volunteer or travel. “In reality, students don’t have the funds to do this,” says Becky Kells, editor of AllAboutSchoolLeavers. “Many gap years are now UK-based, consisting of back-to-back internships and part-time work.”For those who do go abroad, a gap-year stint volunteering is no longer merely a way for middle-class kids to boost their CVs. Graduates say they are making more considered choices. “As part of my degree I had done lots of studying about postcolonialism and the white saviour complex, and I was very conscious I didn’t want to do that,” says Adams, who volunteered with the International Citizen Service on a programme part-funded by the government, in a team consisting of both local and British people. “When I was 16, I went on a school trip to Swaziland and everyone took lots of photos with kids in that village. Looking back, that seems quite problematic. This time, I know I’ve done something that will be worthwhile and wasn’t damaging.”Adams adds that the practical experience of working abroad helped her apply for a master’s, which was something she didn’t have time to do during her finals.Although graduates can bring great skills to volunteering and enhance their employability, there are some risks attached. “You are delaying your career or further study for a year and some employers may not get why you’ve done it,” says Manuel Souto-Otero, a senior lecturer in social sciences at Cardiff University who specialises in the link between education and work. His advice is not to stand still. “It makes sense to work out what to do, and one of the best ways to find out what to do is to try it out.”After her year abroad, Ricci has now decided to start a master’s in September. She says graduates should ignore stereotypes and do what works for them. “Do what you want, regardless of what others might say.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20d5c1898d4f20248ae4f1e3a63218bd36f687f8/228_205_814_488/master/814.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2b4ea2f5aec9aba001eb025bfee52ca","title":"why greta thunberg joined the 1975","story":"Why have a band who hate guest stars teamed up with the world’s most famous environmental activist?As viral stunts go, getting the weather onside for your collaboration with the world’s most famous environmental activist is quite the coup. But, unlike newsagents hawking two-for-one lollies and tabloid front pages extolling fun in the sun, the 1975 and Greta Thunberg aren’t pretending there’s any silver lining to this heatwave.“Unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems, we most probably don’t stand a chance,” says Thunberg on the track (confusingly, also called The 1975), a rallying cry for action on the climate crisis.Over on Twitter, the band’s frontman, Matt Healy, has pointed out that “Steves” and “Marys” identifying themselves as “Brexiteers” have been united in their dismissal of the track. The BBC has helpfully stated that the band will more than likely take international flights to complete their upcoming tour dates, “despite air travel being a significant contributor to climate change”. (Manager Jamie Oborne told the  that they couldn’t fix touring overnight, but that it was no reason not to act.)Sure, an ambient, spoken-word song is probably not going to do much about the “overall failures of our current systems” that Thunberg speaks of. But what it does is to intelligently weaponise the “current systems” within which the 1975 exist.They may not be the world’s most commercially successful band, but – with their stylish aesthetic, unfiltered intimacy with fans and success with a post-genre mix of everything from soft rock to emo – they are one of the most mimicked, and so Thunberg’s message could spread far beyond their network. Spotify’s recommendation algorithms work by assigning thousands of intricate data points to every song, then using that data to link a track you already like, to another one you haven’t heard but would probably like as well. So, it’s easily a short leap from, say, shameless 1975 imitators Catfish and the Bottlemen to the extremely 1975-aping tracks on the new Kaiser Chiefs album to the actual band’s five-minute speech about the imperative to act on the climate emergency. Songs can’t change the world, but they can change minds.Teaming up with Thunberg is also a canny subversion of the music industry’s obsession with “features”, where artists combine star power to sweep up maximum streams and radio playlisting (especially in the US, where radio tends to be segregated by genre). See: the latest albums by Ed Sheeran, Mark Ronson and DJ Khaled, and the charts, where such tracks make up half of the current UK Top 40. The 1975 have never done a feature before, and have criticised it as a shameless grab for chart positions. That they made an exception to centre Thunberg’s vital message shows them using their platform to amplify women’s voices (something they did earlier this year when Healy read, well, something I wrote about misogyny in music at the Brits) instead of coining it in themselves. They are not just ceding the floor: the band and Thunberg’s proceeds from the track are going to Extinction Rebellion.Track features are always timely, and often fleeting things, striking while a trend or artist is hot. And Thunberg is nothing if not the voice of our time. But her track with the 1975 will ultimately open their forthcoming album, Notes on a Conditional Form – an album that, going by their last few, may end up being considered one of the defining records of the 21st century, outlasting this moment. In years to come, their collaboration may stand as a bellwether: will our offspring’s offspring be dumpster ing for old vinyl with which to construct shelter from the sun, or will they live in a world where they can listen back to it and feel relieved that we made it after all?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af0eaed2f7e10f397645c0dbe8492d65329152d2/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ed43804ef4e7fb8e4b9a21a4da9d244d 2020w","title":"dominic cummings role provokes alarm inside civil service","story":"Whitehall unions say rushing into radical changes before Brexit could be ‘catastrophic’Boris Johnson’s decision to recruit Dominic Cummings as a key adviser has provoked concern and disbelief among union leaders and civil servants.The man credited with masterminding the campaign to leave the European Union, who has described Downing Street’s machine as “decrepit”, will coordinate the new prime minister’s pledge to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October.It emerged on Wednesday that Cummings, 47, will also have a role overseeing the recruitment of special advisers who counsel ministers. It is part of a move to centralise a political function that was once fulfilled by government departments.Last month he wrote a blogpost calling for a revolution in Whitehall and an end to the Kafka-esque influence of senior mandarins.Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect union, which represents specialist civil servants, said it could be “catastrophic” for Cummings and the incoming government to rush into radical changes across Whitehall before Brexit.“Dominic Cummings has in the past called for a widespread restructuring of the way the civil service operates. We have already seen, barely half a day into the regime, a step change in the way accountability operates with special advisers,” he said.“At a time when the government is so utterly dependent on its civil service it would be catastrophic to embark on a distracting reorganisation to address misplaced views about the civil service.”Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said Cummings, like other “self-styled disruptors” such as Steve Hilton, a former director of strategy for David Cameron, would struggle once he dealt with the realities of government.“There’s a huge difference between bringing in new ideas or radical agendas and implementing untested ideologies which, if they go wrong, will impact upon the delivery of public services to millions of citizens,” he said.“Ultimately, it will be for the prime minister and ministers to decide on the government’s agenda – with advice from the civil service and special advisers – as they will ultimately be accountable for any success or failure of any policy.”Mark Serwotka, head of the PCS union of rank-and-file civil servants, said Cummings’s disregard for parliamentary rules – he was found to be in contempt after failing to appear before an MPs’ committee – increased concerns that he would ignore basic protocol.“Reports of his hatred for the civil service are concerning and show his ignorance about the important work our members do,” he said.Cummings, who has a reputation for being quick-witted, foul-mouthed and outspoken, was an adviser to Michael Gove at the education department, and later became campaign director for Vote Leave during the EU referendum.He was the lead character, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, in James Graham’s TV dramatisation of the Brexit campaign earlier this year. From County Durham and educated at a private school and Oxford, he is credited with devising the leave side’s winning strategy, including coming up with its hugely resonant “take back control” slogan.He was not seen with Johnson during the latter’s campaign to become prime minister, but he had been in touch with the former London mayor over many months, it was claimed. “There’s no doubt that Dominic had a hand in the campaign. He has been part of a general Boris4PM plan for a long time,” said one leave veteran.Dominic Cummings, the son of an oil rig project manager and a special needs teacher, was born in Durham in 1971. He attended a state primary school followed by the fee-paying Durham school and, in 1994, Oxford University, where he studied ancient and modern history.\u0026nbspAfter three years living in Russia, where he attempted to set up an airline connecting Samara in the south with Vienna, the then 28-year-old became campaign director of Business for Sterling, which worked to prevent Britain from joining the euro.Although he has never, as far as anyone knows, been a member of a political party, Cummings was headhunted to be director of strategy for the then Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2002.While he was seen as a “young, thrusting moderniser”, Cummings quickly\u0026nbspoffended party traditionalists. He quit the job after only eight months, describing Duncan Smith as incompetent.Following the 2010 general election, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, appointed Cummings as his chief of staff. Many in Whitehall found Cummings as difficult as he found them. In 2013, civil servants in the Department for Education\u0026nbspcomplained to the Independent\u0026nbspof an “us-and-them, aggressive, intimidating culture” created by Cummings and Gove.He never hid his disdain for the workings of Whitehall and has derided Westminster figures in eye-catching\u0026nbspmedia interviews\u0026nbspand published\u0026nbsprambling blogposts\u0026nbspthat are obsessed over by Westminster insiders. He described prime minister David Cameron as “a sphinx without a riddle”, and former Brexit minister David Davis as “thick as mince, lazy as a toad, and vain as Narcissus”.In 2015, Cummings and the political strategist Matthew Elliott founded Vote Leave, which was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official EU referendum\u0026nbspleave campaign\u0026nbspin April of the following year.In July 2018, the Electoral Commission announced Vote Leave had been found guilty of breaking electoral law by overspending, following testimony from whistleblowers. The group was\u0026nbspfined £61,000\u0026nbspand referred to the police. Cummings has used his blog to furiously defend himself and the Vote Leave campaign. In March 2019, he was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear at a committee of MPs investigating fake news.He will be working alongside Sir Edward Lister, who has been running the transition team. Lister is expected by some ministers to stand down following Brexit, leaving Cummings as the prime minister’s most senior aide.Although No 10 has to approve all special adviser appointments, ultimately it is ministers who are responsible for the conduct of their special advisers, sometimes known as “Spads”, including discipline, as they make the appointment under the terms of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010.Changes to the rules under Johnson mean that all such advisers will now be employed centrally rather than with different contracts. One source claimed that Cummings insisted upon a right to veto future recruitments, a claim that has not been confirmed.A Downing Street source said: “Spads serve the PM. They have always had to be approved by the PM. That will continue.”Cummings was himself vetoed for a special adviser role by Andy Coulson,David Cameron’s own special adviser during his premiership in 2010.Some Brexiter MPs have cheered the recruitment of such a committed leaver. Andrew Bridgen, the MP for North West Leicestershire, said: “Anyone who might have hoped that we weren’t leaving on October 31 now knows. With Cummings there, it dispels all myths.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a084e1ce52045fc37e7b4f927a48238674bb74c3/0_73_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce7c892bc5ccc8f362c6438424f21453","title":"priti patel earning 1000 an hour as adviser to firm supplying mod","story":"New home secretary has been working for communications firm Viasat as strategic adviserThe new home secretary, Priti Patel, holds a £1,000-an hour contract with a global communications firm that supplies products and services to the UK government, the  can reveal.Patel, who was appointed on Wednesday by the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, as a part of a wholesale gutting of the cabinet, has been working for Viasat for the past three months as a strategic adviser on a salary of £5,000 a month for five hours’ work a month.She recorded the role on the MPs’ register of interests, and the contract is due to expire on 31 July.Viasat, a Californian company with a UK base in Farnborough, supplies services and products to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The MoD works in collaboration with the Home Office on numerous projects, including the Innovation and Research Insights (IRIS) Unit, which sets up technology-based contracts for both departments.Patel, who was forced to resign from government two years ago for failing to disclose secret meetings with Israeli ministers, is understood to have been advising Viasat on a matter relating to India.Patel, whose Gujarati Indian parents migrated to the UK in the 1960s, was formerly David Cameron’s champion for the Indian diaspora community in the UK and is a supporter of India’s populist prime minister, Narendra Modi.Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, said: “Priti Patel has already been forced out of the cabinet once for dodgy meetings. You’d think she’d be more careful with her second chance.“It is unacceptable for any cabinet minister to be a paid advisor for a company with government contracts. The only interests a home secretary is working for should be the country’s. Patel must give up her role with Visasat immediately or leave the cabinet again.”She also holds a role as director of Accloud, an accounting software firm, which targets firms in India.

It seems it has become something of a Tory tradition, after John Major spent the very first day after he lost the prime ministership watching Surrey thrash the British Universities at the Oval.The day’s play May watched was a little more entertaining than the one Major got and she even seemed to enjoy the long stretches of it she spent listening to Colin Graves, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board. Presumably he, and everyone else in the executive box, managed to stop themselves from cracking jokes about Ireland’s backstop.Out in the middle, England were wrestling with some intractable problems of their own, namely their flimsy top and frail middle order. They stumbled on a solution for one of them by using Jack Leach as a nightwatchman. They have been looking for an opener ever since Andrew Strauss retired. They have promoted Joe Root, and shoehorned in Moeen Ali, brought back Jonathan Trott for a crack, picked Nick Compton, plumped for Adam Lyth, given Michael Carberry a go, had a hunch about Ben Duckett, dallied with Sam Robson, found Haseeb Hameed then lost him again, had a punt on Alex Hales, tried Keaton Jennings, and have settled in the end for Rory Burns and Jason Roy.It seems they were looking in the wrong places, since they had one skulking down the order at No 11. Although Jack Leach was not what you would call an obvious pick. He is averaging 4.66 in the Championship for Somerset this year, with a top score of nine. He is a better bat than that makes him sound – or he was, until he got hit on the head by Morne Morkel when he was playing against Surrey last summer. It took him a week to recover from the concussion, but longer to get over the knock to his confidence. He had only just made the highest first‑class score of his life just a couple of weeks earlier, 66 against Lancashire, but has not made it past 18 in 35 innings since.He has plenty of heart, though, so when England needed someone to cover for Roy, their swaggering alpha batsman, late on Wednesday evening, in he went. And, streaky as his play was on Thursday morning, he did not look desperately out of place in England’s top three, which, admittedly, probably says more about their form than his. Rory Burns looked short of confidence, and got out, for the second time in this match, reaching for a wide delivery he had no need to go anywhere near. Still, the opening stand of 26 he put on with Leach, was, incredibly, the fifth-best England have managed since Alastair Cook retired last September.Leach had done a lot of playing and missing in those early overs, when he was beaten over and again playing outside off. But everything changed when Mark Adair bowled him something full and inviting, which Leach clipped back down the ground for four. Next over Boyd Rankin made a similar mistake, and again Leach knocked the ball back the way it came for four. Then he drove tidily through the covers for another and, two balls later, clipped a third off his hips. And Lord’s, all of a sudden, cannot have seemed so very different to Convent Field, where he has spent many happy hours batting at No 4 for Taunton Deane in the West of England Premier League.Leach even took a single off the sixth ball of that over, just to spare Roy from having to face Tim Murtagh and his menacing 75mph outswing. He met Roy mid-pitch to bump fists, and, presumably, to reassure him that “I’ll handle this”. He took his helmet off and stood there, his bald head glowing red as he mopped his brow.It was hot out there now, the air almost too thick to breathe. In high summer, Leach had found his mid-season form and came skipping down the pitch and a clip for four through midwicket.Leach’s 50 came with a thick edge past the slips, and then he pressed on, beyond that career‑best score of 66. After lunch, Ireland finally realised they ought to try bouncing him out, and set Rankin loose with a leg slip and a short leg. Well, it was a thankless business on this pitch. Leach got in square behind the straight ones, but had a little trouble with the others.He flapped a catch past leg slip, was dropped once too, on 72, and you felt then that it was the break he needed, that he might become the first Englishman to score a Test century as a nightwatchman. No such luck. He fell for 92, from 162 balls, the longest, and best, innings he has ever played.Harder still, Leach will likely get dropped from the team next week. Which is a rough way to treat someone who spent all that time doing his bloody-minded best to clean up his team’s mess. Somewhere up in her box, May may just have been an ex-prime minister who had a pretty good idea how he felt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7236f4ccd5aecbf05e83f70e6cfbd90234aaa956/274_587_4536_2721/master/4536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d5c3844e85fefe7b9aa6fd58ea89e0a","title":"talking horses dettori nervous as he carries hopes of nation on enable","story":"Enable is the hot favourite for Saturday’s King Gorge after the final declaration stage when all 11 entries stood their groundFrankie Dettori has been taking an average of nine mounts per week in Britain since the start of May, but he is enjoying one of his most successful seasons in more than three decades in the saddle and will hope to move even further clear of his weighing-room rivals in terms of winnings this season when he rides Enable in the King George at Ascot on Saturday.And yet as Dettori admitted at Sandown Park on Thursday, he still gets nervous before a big-race assignment like the King George, which Enable will enter on a 10-race winning streak that dates back to May 2017 after her latest win in the Eclipse Stakes earlier this month.Enable is the hot favourite for Saturday’s race after the final declaration stage on Thursday morning, when all 11 of the five-day entries stood their ground.John Gosden’s mare is a 4-7 chance while Crystal Ocean, who was one of Dettori’s Group One winners last month when successful in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot, is 11-4.

George and the Dragon is being performed by a group of older actors, part of local community theatre group Immediate Theatre and the Arcola’s over-50s group. The familiar story of the princess, the knight and the man-eating dragon is told in a traditional manner, but contemporary concerns such as the destruction of nature and the environment have been taken into account, adding a crucial new twist.The dragon’s natural habitat has been destroyed, deforestation has ruined its home, and it has nothing to eat other than the townsfolk. The children in the audience are asked to vote whether the dragon should live or die. Today’s performance is the final of six that the group have performed to local primary schools across east London although the vote is for life, it’s the closest it has come to death. One of the boys who voted for death said it’s “because the dragon took thousands of lives!” Another declares: “I don’t trust dragons!”“We prepared two endings,” says writer Penny Cliff. The less bloody one, which we saw today, has the characters coming together to plant seeds symbolising a fresh start.Over the last few years, the levels of air pollution around primary schools in cities across the UK has made headlines. There have been calls for more to be done to improve air quality for children, especially after the death of Ella Kissi-Debrah, a girl from Lewisham with severe asthma, whose death may have been related to pollution levels on the route she took to school. Cliff says she did not want to make the play too specific to one issue such as air pollution near schools and instead wanted to focus more on “the impact of poisoning the environment”. She explains: “It is important to write a piece of theatre that is not specific about one thing, but one that communities can take away from it what they need to take, based on how it resonates with them.”And indeed this week, children from the six schools are joining the older performers to create an intergenerational sequel that they will then perform. The children come from a wide range of backgrounds many live on local estates. Jo Carter, the show’s director and the founder of the company, says: “We hope that by working creatively together, all our participants will get to know each other and understand the opportunities and challenges faced by residents at opposite ends of the age spectrum.” Working with both older and younger people is what makes Immediate Theatre and its partnership programmes so rare.Immediate Theatre’s work sees them engage in a range of community-based theatre projects. For last autumn’s Our Space project, the company collaborated with children from the Nightingale estate to create a graffiti mural as a response to such issues as knife crime, drug dealing and antisocial behaviour. Councillor Sem Moema, from the Hackney Downs ward where the Nightingale is located, highlights the “massive role” Immediate Theatre has played in bringing arts to residents and local people. “In Nightingale in particular, we’ve had a lot of serious issues around gun and knife crime, as well as other issues relating to a lack of opportunities for young people being drawn into drugs, drug dealing and low-level gang activity,” she says.The Christmas panto, Cindy Rella, was also an intergenerational collaboration between Immediate and the Arcola over-50s group and involved young people from the Nightingale estate who all created a show inspired by Cinderella. Moema points out that bringing the two age groups together for a theatre show is a creative way to deal with antisocial behaviour. “We’ve taken a public health approach to dealing with the perpetrators of the violence and antisocial behaviour, and one of the issues that came up was the mistrust and misunderstanding between generations, as well as the lack of positive activities that people of all ages and abilities could take part in. People like Jo and community-based arts organisations – who really should be at the core of funding – have helped local people begin to reclaim their neighbourhood and bring their community back together.”• The sequel will be performed on 26 July at 4pm at the Wally Foster Centre, Clapton, London.

What are the options?My wife is an artist. She has been using a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 since 2014. This allows her to draw and paint using a stylus supplied with the pad. She loves using it, but it’s past its best and the battery won’t hold a charge for very long. I am thinking of buying her a replacement. What should I go for? HughIf you’re an artist who uses computers, you’ve never had it so good, as former prime minister Harold Macmillan almost said. Touch-sensitive screens are becoming ubiquitous, so there are dozens of usable devices at a wide range of price points. However, they are not all the same, and people can be confused by the differences.At first, artists mainly used graphics tablets connected to personal computers, with Wacom becoming the dominant brand. In this case, you draw on the tablet with a stylus and your pen-strokes appear on a separate screen. It’s a little like using a mouse.Graphics tablets and drawing tablets use the computing power of laptops or desktops, so they can handle the huge, detailed drawings required for architectural design and similar purposes. The tablet view may be just a window onto a much larger design.Today, almost all smartphones and tablets, and most hybrid or convertible laptops, have touch screens, so you can draw on them with your fingers. A smaller number support pens. The key point is that they are standalone devices. They don’t need to be attached to a computer.The leading examples fall into three main ranges: Samsung’s Galaxy Tab, Apple’s iPad Pro and Microsoft’s Surface Pro. There are alternatives, but these are the ones to beat.From a drawing point of view, the important points include screen size and resolution, the colour accuracy of the screen, pen pressure levels and latency. Basically, if you press harder, the pen should produce a stronger line. A pressure sensitivity of 2,048 is recommended. I can’t tell the difference between 256, 1024 and 2048, but as an artist, your wife probably can.Latency refers to the delay between the pen or stylus moving across the screen and a line appearing. Latency used to be terrible on tablets. It doesn’t seem to be a problem on the latest devices, though some apps are worse than others. The best way to check latency is to try a device. However, you can get a pretty good idea from watching people draw in YouTube videos.Standalone tablets, unlike graphics tablets, can perform many other functions. You can do your email, watch videos, play games and so on. Some people will choose one tablet rather than another because it runs particular software – such as Adobe Creative Suite – or particular apps. Some will be influenced by how well it works with their other devices and online services, such as Office 365. Many will be influenced by price, though you haven’t given me a budget.With hindsight, it would be a good idea to check how much it costs to replace the battery in the tablet you choose. All the main ranges have sealed-in batteries, which does not bode well for their longevity. Battery degradation is also a risk factor when buying second-hand devices.As I’ve said before, it’s generally not worth changing systems unless you need to. When you switch, you give up a lot of valuable experience, you lose the comfort of familiarity, and you may have to find and learn a lot of new programs andor apps. You shouldn’t switch unless the new system delivers one or more significant advantages – not minor ones that all its rivals will add in a year or so – and does not come with numerous disadvantages.Your wife seems to be a happy Samsung Galaxy user. If she doesn’t have any real problems with her current device, and isn’t keen to try something new, your replacement should be as much like that as possible, only better.The S4 improves on the 9.7in S3 by offering a bigger screen with higher resolution, slimmer bezels, a faster processor and twice as much storage. However, the S3 is still a viable option if you want something cheaper. Artist blogger Teoh Yi Chie compares the S3 and S4 in a YouTube video, and in a more detailed post at Parka Blogs.To the starting price, you would need to add an Apple Pencil 2 (£119), and possibly an SD card connector (£39) and a headphone jack converter (£9). You might also want the keyboard case (£199), AppleCare (£129) and some other dongles. It adds up, and for drawing, it’s silly money.Fortunately, there are cheaper options. The 10.5in iPad Air (2019) is very much like the old iPad Pro (2017) but has a much faster processor, and it’s cheaper. The main things you lose are the “ProMotion display” refresh rate of up to 120 Hz – the iPad Air is a perfectly acceptable 60Hz – a couple of small speakers and a slightly worse rear camera (8MP instead of 12MP).Usually, someone would choose based on a need for certain apps or a preference for one of the operating systems. I think the iPad has more and better tablet apps. However, both systems seem to be about equally good for drawing, and your wife already knows how to use Android.One interesting but decidedly odd device is Lenovo’s 10.1in Yoga Book convertible. This has two touch-screens: a colour screen for normal use, and a monochrome screen that doubles as a keyboard. You can also use the monochrome screen for writing and drawing. It has 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity, so it might be quite good. (I only tried the keyboard I didn’t like it.)The Yoga Book YB1-X90L shows its heritage in its Intel Atom x5-Z8550 processor, 4GB of memory, 64GB of storage and 1920 x 1200 screen resolution.It’s not the best choice for your wife’s purposes. However, others could find uses for a 690g dual-screen Android laptop where one screen works as a colour tablet and the other lets you draw and make handwritten notes.Have you got a question?

Folk memory or epigenetics would stir, and there I would be – calling fire down from heaven, searching for stigmatists and generally making a nuisance of myself, especially to Protestants. As I have grown older, I have realised this is unlikely for many reasons. First of all, God is dead – this was surely confirmed on Wednesday when Boris Johnson moved into 10 Downing Street. Second, my forebears must have been a much more extrovert lot than I am. I temperamentally incline to something quieter less show, more focus. Something to which I can, since this documentary, call “more Bruderhoffy”.The Bruderhof is a radical Christian movement, founded 100 years ago, that comprises 3,000 members living in 23 settlements around the world. Inside the Bruderhof (BBC One) followed the lives of some of those ensconced in Darvell, their Sussex enclave. Bernard Hibbs, who has lived there for 30 years, explains that their purpose “is to follow Jesus as closely as possible, especially the Sermon on the Mount, and not wait for some future glorious kingdom to come”. To this heaven-on-earthly end, the Bruderhof live as collectively and non-hierarchically as possible. Possessions are shared, clothes (many made on site) are issued from a central repository, food also comes from a central store and is cooked and eaten communally. There’s a farm, a school, a laundry and no electricity, smartphones or other technology. Although the enterprise is funded by a multi-million pound business selling Bruderhof-made children’s toys and furniture, the movement itself does not use money. Their currency is shared faith.One of those followed was Hannah, 18-year-old daughter of Ruthie and Mark and a third-generation Bruderhoffian, who was preparing to embark on their version of the Amish rumspringa – living for a year in the outside world so she can make an informed decision about committing to the sect for life. She will live with a Bruderhof foster family in – I suppose it shouldn’t sound unlikely, but it does – Peckham, south London. Mark, an American, did his God-gap year in South Carolina – “Tough times ended up being good times. And I learned to pray real fast!” He hopes Hannah will learn that people lead different lives “and that it doesn’t matter. God works in many colours.”Hannah’s mother is more conflicted. “I hope you learn to depend completely on God,” she tells her daughter. It’s the kind of line that could raise secular hackles, but such was the considered pace and mood of the film that instead you found yourself wondering if the sentiment wasn’t one we all share: listen to your conscience don’t give in to outside pressures above all, be steady.Elsewhere, the inquisitive rather than inquisitorial approach led to some aspects of the group’s ideology being undutifully glossed over. What are these “restrictions on same-sex relationships” mentioned only in voiceover? We can imagine, of course, but I would like to know. I would also like to know what happens to those who want to follow Christ in the Bruderhoffian way but the Bruderhof don’t approve of who they love.Less controversial problematic areas were better confronted, such as the overtly old-fashioned dress for the women (a result of the greater changes there have been in women’s clothing than men’s, says Hibbs, rather than any deliberate emphasis on female modesty) and the traditional split along gender lines in work and domestic duties. Women in the kitchen and laundry, men in the factory and farms is still how God wants it, apparently. Good documentaries, like good Christians, will make you do that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6465b761e7f9e816a2897c26c8ac7ae8359054a5/922_281_4078_2447/master/4078.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=889aba51fefc9a99ec953aba229413b7","title":"china business xi jinping communist party state private enterprise huawei","story":"Much of modern China’s epic growth was driven by private enterprise – but under Xi Jinping, the Communist party has returned to being the ultimate authority in business as well as politics. By  Richard McGregorFrom the Mao era onwards, Chinese state firms have always had a predominant role in the economy, and the Communist party has always maintained direct control over state firms. For more than a decade, the party has also tried to ensure it played a role inside private businesses. But in his first term in office, Xi has overseen a sea change in how the party approaches the economy, dramatically strengthening the party’s role in both government and private businesses.Such shifts, under Xi, have gifted the US and EU an excuse to limit Chinese access to their markets, technology and companies. Australia has cited the same intelligence law to keep Huawei’s 5G technology out of its future mobile networks. Gordon Sondland, Donald Trump’s envoy to the European Union, gave such sentiment a hyperbolic spin to argue that Europe should do the same. “We want to keep critical infrastructure in the western world out of Chinese malign influence,” Sondland said. “Someone from the politburo in Beijing picks up the phone and says, ‘I wanna listen in on the following conversation, I wanna run a certain car off the road that’s on the 5G network and kill the person that’s in it’ – there’s nothing that company legally can do today in China to prevent the Chinese government from making that request successfully.”Until recently, such a statement would have been laughed out of court. No longer. Nor would Washington have contemplated the policy of “decoupling” the US and Chinese economies – shorthand for the administration’s commitment, through taxes, tariffs and other punitive measures, to disentangle its companies and their technologies from China’s supply chains.The relationship between the party and private sector companies is, up to a point, flexible – certainly more so than with state companies. The party doesn’t habitually micromanage their day-to-day operations. The firms are largely still in charge of their basic business decisions. But pressure from party committees to have a seat at the table when executives are making big calls on investment and the like means the “lines have been dangerously blurred”, in the words of one analyst. “Chinese domestic laws and administrative guidelines, as well as unspoken regulations and internal party committees, make it quite difficult to distinguish between what is private and what is state-owned.”The answer to the question “does the party control a company?” is that it is impossible to tell. In the current environment, fewer foreign governments want to give Beijing the benefit of the doubt. If there was any question as to who was in charge of the economy and business, Xi’s local and overseas critics alike only have to take the Chinese leader at his word, that in private enterprises, as with state-owned firms and every institution in China, the party is the ultimate authority.In the early optimistic glow of Xi’s ascension to the leadership, a number of western commentators talked up his appreciation of markets. After all, from 1985 to 2007, Xi had served in two provinces, Fujian and Zhejiang, which were thriving bastions of private enterprise. Starting in the 1980s, Fujian was an important gateway for investors from nearby Taiwan, while Zhejiang was home to a number of China’s most famous private companies, such as Jack Ma’s Alibaba. The arc of Xi’s father’s career, from revolutionary to reformer, reinforced this optimism about China’s new leader. Lu Guanqiu, a businessman who owned and ran Wanxiang, a private car parts group, told Bloomberg: “When Xi becomes general secretary, he’ll be even more open and will pay even more attention to private enterprise and the people’s livelihood. It is because he was in Zhejiang for five years.”Yet a deeper dig into Xi’s past statements and writings on the economy reveals an official who has been a dogged supporter of party orthodoxy on the economy at every turn. Xi might have taken big risks in domestic and foreign policy, but on the economy he was not one for ideological experimentation. In the politburo, as vice-president from 2008 to 2013 and as the leader of the party school for most of the same period, there is little evidence of him straying from his core beliefs about the need to strengthen party control inside businesses.When Xi arrived in Zhejiang in 2002, the province was already well on the way up the economic ladder. Xi headed a group of officials, known as the “New Zhejiang Army”, who embraced the use of private investment to spread the risk in funding the province’s signature infrastructure projects. In 2007, in a conversation with Washington’s then ambassador to Beijing, Clark Randt Jr, recorded in US diplomatic cables and later released by WikiLeaks, Xi delivered a sophisticated, self-aware exposition on Zhejiang. He didn’t pretend that there was any secret to the province’s wealth other than local entrepreneurs, although he avoided using the language of the market in describing them. Xi did what every other official with responsibility for the economy did at the time: he simplified registration for private companies and helped them to access finance. When the party debated a law to protect private property, he supported it. “With property protection in place, Chinese can gain even more wealth,” Xi told Randt.But Xi’s support for mixing private and public ownership structures was purely pragmatic. It had value, he said in another forum, because it would “improve the socialist market economic structure”. Xi’s assessment is echoed by Michael Collins, one of the CIA’s most senior officials for Asia. “The fundamental end of the Communist party of China under Xi Jinping is all the more to control that society politically and economically,” Collins argued earlier this year. “The economy is being viewed, affected and controlled to achieve a political end.”By 2012, when Xi came to power, the landscape had changed substantially. China was initially knocked sideways by the global financial crisis in 2008, before swiftly navigating its way back to fast growth through a giant fiscal stimulus orchestrated by the government and delivered by the big state banks. The economy was also changing shape. From around 2010, after the fiscal splurge of the financial crisis, Chinese technocrats began to focus more intently on cutting debt and lifting consumption. That meant less focus on investment and exports and, if you listened to the entrepreneurs, a greater reliance on private business to generate growth.“Chinese consumption is not driven by the government but by entrepreneurship, and the market,” Jack Ma of Alibaba said in September 2015. “In the past 20 years, the government was so strong. Now, they are getting weak. It’s our opportunity it’s our show time, to see how the market economy, entrepreneurship, can develop real consumption.”Ma may have thought that the times suited him, and to a degree, they did. His business continued to soar. But Xi was all the time making sure that the party grew in tandem with the economy, in both the state and private sectors. In retrospect, Ma’s comments look dangerously cocky.Xi spent much of his first term in power reining in the big state firms. Under his predecessor, Hu Jintao, many of the large state enterprises, big enough to be in the top 20 of the global Fortune 500, had grown into powerful empires and breeding grounds for serious corruption. In the words of analyst Wendy Leutert, Xi “faced the aftermath of a decade of rapid expansion and weak internal discipline in the state sector”.In 2016, Xi chaired a national meeting that cleared the way for a more expansive role for the party in enterprise. In 2017, the measures were further extended, with the body overseeing big state companies directing them to write the party into their articles of association. In 2018, the securities regulator followed up by issuing a new corporate governance code requiring listed firms, at home and abroad, to include in their internal guidelines an expansive role for the party. Many Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong also wrote the party’s role into their articles of association.In some ways, codifying in public documents the party’s role in managing companies was both an instance of rare transparency and part of an increasing trend of the party openly displaying its power. In the past, Chinese state-owned listed companies had customarily filed misleading prospectuses ahead of their stock exchange listings, omitting the party’s pivotal role in the hiring and firing of senior executives. Similarly, company boards had long been legally and theoretically independent of the party, but not in practice. “The same inidual who is chairing a party committee meeting on a Monday might well be chairing a board meeting later in the week,” notes a 2018 report on Chinese corporate governance.There has always been an awkward fit between western notions of corporate governance and the party state’s insistence on having a role in companies. “It is rather like drawing a tiger with a cat as a model,” said one Chinese commentator. But the direction of policy under Xi has been clear: the power that the party had over business decisions and personnel in state firms, once wielded behind the scenes, would not only be strengthened. The party’s power would also be exercised explicitly.Xi’s shadow now looms increasingly large over private firms as well. In March 2012, a few months before taking over as general secretary, Xi delivered a speech in which he stressed the need to increase the number of party bodies inside private business. Around the same time, new details for “party building” in enterprises were released, calling “for the party secretary to participate in and attend important executive-level meetings”.Although the party is becoming more involved in private firms than ever, it wants to be part of business successes, not failures. It wants to sit alongside local and foreign entrepreneurs and share their wealth, not run their companies into the ground. Increasingly, it also wants to do more than supervise companies. It wants to be at the table when commercial decisions are made, not just manage staff. “We should make money together,” Lu Wei, then head of China’s party office for internet security, told Paul Jacobs, CEO of Qualcomm, a US chip maker, in 2014. Lu’s comments to some extent reflected Beijing’s desire to acquire Qualcomm’s technology, a sector in which China was weak. But the message was clear: the fat of the land should be shared with the state.The party’s overarching aim, though, has remained consistent: to ensure that the private sector, and inidual entrepreneurs, do not become rival players in the political system. The party wants economic growth, but not at the expense of tolerating any organised alternative centres of power. During the 1990s, Chinese leaders watched in horror as the Soviet Union disintegrated and its assets were privatised. Having seen business threaten to take over the state in Russia, Beijing has been determined to make sure that the same disaster does not befall China.For a reliable benchmark about the power of the party in China, you only need to listen to wealthy entrepreneurs hold forth on politics. These otherwise all-powerful CEOs go to abject lengths to praise the party. To take a few companies listed in a single article in the South China Morning Post, Richard Liu of e-commerce group JD predicted communism would be realised in his generation and all commercial entities would be nationalised. Xu Jiayin of Evergrande Group, one of China’s largest property developers, said that everything the company possessed was given by the party and he was proud to be the party secretary of his company. Liang Wengen of Sany Heavy Industry, which builds earthmovers, went even further, saying his life belonged to the party. “They act as if they are being chased by a bear,” wrote Zhang Lin, a Beijing political commentator, in response to these comments. “They are powerless to control the bear, so they are competing to outrun each other to escape the animal.”Jack Ma of Alibaba, the global face of Chinese entrepreneurship, has always managed to strike a quirkier and more independent stance than his fellow billionaires. “Be in love with the government. But don’t marry them,” he memorably said at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2015. Ma’s pithy aphorisms at home and abroad were mostly a plus for his business, but they had a downside. Ma’s high profile made him vulnerable. Last year, one of Ma’s former business partners told me, only half-joking, that if there was a presidential election in China tomorrow, Ma might win. That, he added, was a dangerous position to be in.In September 2018, Ma unexpectedly announced that he would step down from a day-to-day role in the company the following year. Ma said he wanted to focus on education and philanthropy. An equally plausible reason for his resignation, the former business partner said, was Ma’s fear that his power and popularity had made him a target of the party. Ma has been in the party since the 1980s, although his membership was not declared until late 2018, after his retirement announcement, in an article in which the People’s Daily newspaper complimented him for his contributions to reform.Whether or not some entrepreneurs were intent on taking him on, Xi pre-emptively took the fight to them. In 2017, his administration began a campaign to rein in swashbuckling business leaders, starting with some of the corporate chieftains who had become the standard-bearers for aggressive Chinese dealmaking overseas. Some business leaders were forced out of overheated commercial sectors such as real estate. Others were told to pull back from offshore forays, either because their high profile was an embarrassment for Beijing or because the government was trying to stop capital flight. Some, such as Wu Xiaohui, the chairman of Anbang Insurance Group, went the way that communist members who fall foul of the system often do, vanishing without explanation into the party’s detention system. Only months earlier, Wu had been leading negotiations to spend $14bn on hotels in the US, but the deal collapsed. In May 2018, the authorities announced Wu had been sentenced to 18 years in jail for fraud and embezzlement.Meanwhile, China’s three dominant internet companies, Baidu (a search engine), Alibaba (e-commerce) and Tencent (messaging and gaming), known collectively as the BAT, have all felt the government’s wrath. In 2018, Tencent lost $200bn in its market capitalisation after regulators stopped approving new online games, pushing the company out of the world’s top 10 companies ranked by their share market valuation. The rapid growth of the BAT companies and their dominance of the internet in China has given them an outsized economic status. But their political value is just as important, as they have become indispensable to China’s surveillance state. With the mountain of data they generate, the BAT trinity are in effect turning into a real-time, efficient and privately run intelligence platform. In that respect, they are seen as ideal private companies. They both drive economic growth and also buttress the political system.Foreign CEOs, too, have come under pressure to give the party a larger role in their firms. Again, this is a trend that began before Xi. Walmart, which famously won’t allow unions in its US stores, has had party cells in its companies in China since at least 2006, and party-controlled unions even earlier. Under Xi, however, emboldened officials have pushed foreign firms harder to accommodate the party and give its representatives a role in business decisions.Now a wide range of foreign companies in China, from the cosmetics giant L’Oréal to Walt Disney and Dow Chemicals, all have party committees and display the hammer and sickle on their premises. In 2017, Reuters published an article that quoted executives from one European company saying that party representatives had demanded to be brought into the executive committee and have the business pay their expenses. Like Chinese entrepreneurs, foreign businessmen and women are trying to outrun “the bear”, not always with success.But the party’s persistent efforts to colonise the private sector have stoked a backlash of their own. In late 2017, the EU business chamber in China formally complained about party organisations trying to extend their influence in their member companies, something they said would undermine the authority of their boards.Yet the chamber’s argument was met with indifference in China, at least in public utterances. “When you are in Rome, do as the Romans do,” said Chen Fengying, an expert at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a foreign policy thinktank. “Foreign investors should respect local rules and regulations in China.”On one level, Xi has been untroubled by the backlash over his treatment of entrepreneurs. From his point of view, the idea that the private sector is being overly politicised is upside-down. Business leaders should “strengthen self-study, self-education and self-improvement,” he said in 2016. “They should not feel uncomfortable with this requirement. The Communist party has similar and stricter requirements on its leaders.”Later, in 2018, when the economy started to slow and the trade war was ramping up, Xi was much more pragmatic and solicitous. In November, he invited a select group of entrepreneurs, including Tencent’s Ma Huateng (also known as Pony Ma), for a meeting in the Great Hall of the People. He wanted to reassure them that they were “all part of our family”. At the same time, a surfeit of stories appeared in the official media urging banks to lend private firms more money.But not all entrepreneurs were buying the new line. One businessman, Chen Tianyong, posted a lengthy rant on social media, which he titled “An Entrepreneur’s Farewell Admonition”, explaining why he had left China. “China’s economy is like a giant ship heading to the precipice,” he wrote in a post that was later taken down. “Without fundamental changes, it’s inevitable that the ship will be wrecked and the passengers will die.”Adapted from Xi Jinping: The Backlash by Richard McGregor, published by Penguin Books and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8d92bbf7c973942eb6961213c50a9559887fa34/0_248_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73925806a32413aed2c2deade59032da","title":"british airways to resume flights to cairo after security review","story":"Airline suspended flights to Egyptian capital last Saturday as a precautionary measureBritish Airways said on Thursday it would resume flights to Cairo following a week’s suspension, having reviewed its security measures.BA flights to and from the Egyptian capital will start again on Friday, it said in a statement.The national carrier suspended flights on Saturday as a precautionary measure.“Following a thorough assessment of the security arrangements, we are pleased that our service to and from Cairo will resume from Friday,” BA said.“The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our priority, and we would never operate an aircraft unless it was safe to do so.”German carrier Lufthansa also said it was suspending flights to Cairo from Munich and Frankfurt just for last Saturday.The airlines, two of the biggest in Europe, gave little explanation as to what triggered the moves.An estimated 415,000 British nationals visited Egypt in 2018.In its travel advice for British nationals heading to Egypt, the Foreign Office warns: “There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation.“Additional security measures are in place for flights departing from Egypt to the UK.

Photograph: Ronan McGreevy On April Fool’s Day, 2015, Center Parcs announced the largest tourism investment in Ireland. In the least touristy county.Longford’s status as a tourism destination was reflected in the Lonely Planet guide to Ireland which devoted seven paragraphs out of 750 pages to a county it politely dismissed as a “quiet place of low hills and pastoral scenes. It has few tourist sights”.When the UK holiday operator declared it was going to invest €233 million at Newcastle Wood outside Ballymahon four years ago, many thought it was a joke in keeping with the date of the announcement.“It was always that attitude – Jesus, who’d want to go to Longford?” recalled Jackie White of the Ballymahon Traders Alliance. “Around that time, there was a few documentaries about Longford, ghost estate developments and Section 23 properties. There were so many investment developments built and left to go to rack and ruin.”A sign at the entrance four kilometres out of Ballymahon welcomes visitors to Center Parcs Longford Forest, but the passing visitor seeking a glimpse of this Shangri-la in the Irish midlands will be disappointed. The resort itself is screened by some hefty coniferous trees.Out of sight it might be, but it is on everyone’s mind in Longford as it gets ready to open its doors to visitors on Monday.Prior to the building of the holiday village, Ballymahon’s tourism offering consisted of fishing and kayaking on the River Inny and its association with the novelist and poet Oliver Goldsmith who was born outside the town. Worth seeing, as Samual Johnson once said of the Giant’s Causeway, but not worth going to see.The stately main street, one of the widest in Ireland, does not seem to have changed much since Center Parc’s seismic announcement, but there has already been a transformation in the town’s infrastructure to cope with what is effectively a new town on its doorstep.Ballymahon is now connected to the gas network as a consequence of the development, water mains have been replaced and the stretch of road to the resort has been upgraded. Plans are afoot to improve the roads and footpaths in the town with the introduction of cyclist facilities.James O’Meara of O’Meara’s Auctioneers in Ballymahon has sold a 12-acre site outside the town to a developer who is seeking planning permission to build 102 houses. The application from Northern Ireland-based developer Brian Rogers, which has been lodged with Longford County Council, is the surest sign that others see the long-term economic potential of the area with the holiday village employing 900 people locally.The announcement four years ago had an immediate impact on a moribund property market. “I sold the same apartment for €20,000, then for €40,000 and the third time for €60,000 in the space of 18 months,” said Mr O’Meara.The problem, as his fellow estate agent Ms White points out, was the glut of properties in Longford after the crash. Oversupply was most acute in the Shannon-side counties of Roscommon, Leitrim and Longford where tax incentives provoked a frenzy of building during the boom.Longford was particularly badly affected. An inventory of ghost estates in 2010 found 128 in the county had not yet been completed. “We had over 100 properties. Three-bed semis were €50,000, about 70 per cent below the cost of construction,” Ms White remembers. “Even then you couldn’t give them away. Nobody wanted to know.”House prices have more than doubled in Ballymahon since the Center Parcs announcement, from an average of €55,000 to about €130,000.Ghost estatesThere have been major efforts by Longford County Council to deal with its so-called ghost estates. Of the 128 unfinished housing estates in 2010, 109 have been completed and formally taken in charge by the council. The remaining 19 estates have site resolution plans in place and they are currently being implemented. Six of these will be taken in charge later this year.The can-do spirit generated by the building of the family-oriented, forest themed holiday village has spread to the rest of the county. Last week Longford Chamber of Commerce hosted a “Build Brand Longford” launch. Locals are being encouraged to be ambassadors for the county and to sell its virtues. Longford’s midlands location used to be a bar to visitors as they headed for more picturesque coastal areas. Now its geographical location is the key reason why Center Parcs’s chose to base itself there.In 2017, Longford launched a tourism strategy and this year the county had a presence for the first time at Meitheal, Fáilte Ireland’s international showcase. The county has taken soundings from Center Parcs management on how to retain many of the visitors travelling to Longford.Chamber president Niamh Donlon says the psychological impact of Center Parcs on the county has been “huge” and it has emboldened local tourism-related businesses. The chamber is in the process of putting together a loyalty card and discounts for employees of Center Parcs. To date, 55 businesses have joined up. It is hoped to spread the same loyalty card to the resort’s visitors. “For the first time we will have 2,000-plus people saying they are holidaying in Longford each week. It is changing the narrative, the perception and it is worth an absolute fortune in marketing for us,” she said.Separately, there are plans to build the first living model of a Norman village at Granard, the largest extant Norman motte in Ireland. The €3.5 million project is a significant tourism investment and was first mooted in 2012 when locals realised “there’s a huge amount of history and nobody telling the story”, according to Paul Flood of Granard Motte Community Enterprise. “Center Parcs is going to make a huge difference, 20 per cent of visitors to Center Parcs will come from Northern Ireland. They will be going right by our door.”Other steps have been taken to enhance the county’s tourism offering – the Knights and Conquest centre in Granard has already opened a section of the Royal Canal greenway from Abbeyshrule to Longford, the Midir and Etain walk from Ardagh to Brí Leith is being launched on Sunday, and Edgeworthstown now has a literary trail.The county has benefited from being under the umbrella of Fáilte Ireland’s Hidden Heartland’s initiative to draw in more tourists to the midlands. “You have the real Ireland down here,” Mr Flood said. “There’s no airs and graces about us.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3967723.1564084687!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new children s facility unsafe say top doctors","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConnolly Hospital, Blanchardstown. Consultants  have called for the opening of the new children’s urgent-care service at the hospital to be delayed. File photograph: Dara Mac DonaillNearly 30 of the State’s top paediatric consultants have warned health authorities that it will be unsafe to open the new children’s urgent-care service at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown on schedule next week.Last week, The  reported that the Connolly Hospital facility – the first element of the new national children’s hospital – would initially only open from 8am to 6pm, Monday to Friday, due to a shortage of medical consultants.In a letter on Wednesday, consultants in paediatric emergency medicine, paediatric radiology and paediatric laboratory medicine called for the opening to be put back until it could be done on a safe basis “on as early a date as is feasible”. Risk assessmentThe doctors sought access to a full official risk assessment submitted in early July by Dr David Vaughan, director of quality and safety, but this “has yet to be shared with us by you for our review”, the consultants told CHI chief executive Eilish Hardiman. “The risks that are visible to us are considerable and cumulatively unacceptable to us as hospital consultants, and we therefore do not believe that it is possible to safely open the urgent care and radiology services at CHI Connolly in under one week on July 31.”Responding last week, the CHI said it had been successful in recruiting emergency medicine consultants for the Connolly centre, but acknowledged that temporary vacancies existed “due to maternity and backfill requirements for paediatric emergency medicine posts”.Children’s Health Ireland is the group that oversees the operation of the three existing paediatric hospitals in Dublin. The consultants who wrote to Ms Hardiman are based at the existing three paediatric hospitals at Crumlin, Tallaght and Temple Street.RisksThe  reported last Saturday that a risk assessment “matrix” had identified 12 separate issues, two considered to be “red” risks and 10 “amber” risks which are involved in the opening of the new urgent-care unit.The two red-level risks set out in the document related to CHI’s inability to recruit two consultant paediatric radiologists to work at the new centre at Connolly Hospital and radiology governance issues. CHI said last Friday that it was “using the risk matrix as a guide to work through the issues that need to be addressed to safely open services at CHI at Connolly”, adding that they were “committed to having patient safety at the centre of what we do”.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3967698.1564082117!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new northern secretary to meet coveney and parties","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin’s Conor Murphy: “Boris Johnson’s party abandoned the rigorous impartiality demanded by the Good Friday agreement in order to enter into a self-serving pact with the DUP.” Photograph: Getty ImagesNewly appointed Northern Secretary Julian Smith will visit Belfast on Friday to hold his first meetings in his new post with Tánaiste Simon Coveney and the five Stormont political parties.Described only as a “get to know you” encounter, Mr Smith will also be briefed by Northern Ireland Office officials on the current state of the talks to restore the executive and assembly.The DUP and the Ulster Unionist Party broadly welcomed Mr Smith’s appointment, although the UUP has warned against the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.Sinn Féin and the SDLP expressed concerns about Mr Smith’s previous dealings with the DUP when he was the British government chief whip in charge of relations to keep the confidence and supply agreement in play.“Boris Johnson’s party abandoned the rigorous impartiality demanded by the Good Friday agreement in order to enter into a self-serving pact with the DUP,” said Conor Murphy, a Newry and Armagh Assembly member,“That has proved to be a toxic partnership for our political process with the British government acquiescing to a denial of rights and equality that would never be tolerated in their own country.”Noting the enthusiasm shown by the DUP when they learned of Mr Smith’s appointment, SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon said he could not be a “yes man” for any one party in the talks. She said his past relationship as an alliance-builder with the DUP posed “an immediate challenge” to Smith to demonstrate that “he is not beholden to one party ”.PositivityMeanwhile, the DUP continues to be satisfied by Westminster’s political changes. “We welcome the fresh optimism and positivity coming from the new prime minister,” said deputy leader Nigel Dodds.Saying that it has already had “constructive conversations” with Mr Johnson, Mr Dodd said the DUP looked forward to pursuing a “shared vision” rather than the alternative of a Corbyn government.“Both Boris Johnson and the DUP share the vision that the Union must be strengthened, that Brexit must be delivered, and that Stormont must be restored as quickly as possible.”Full results and coverage of the fallout of the Stormont Assembly election"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Game-changing ovarian cancer drug which extends survival by three years gets NHS green lightWomen still perform bulk of household chores, survey findsSupermarkets are designed to make us fat, say public health experts Heatwave: UK just misses all-time temperature record as commuters endure chaos on railwaysOffer menopausal women testosterone supplements to boost sex drive, scientist sayMost men over 50 should be prescribed blood pressure drugsTeenager who watched pornography before brutal rape and murder of 14-year-old girl can be named, judges ruleComment: Sacking of Mundell could prompt the Scottish Tories to go it alone\u0026#39The children are going to school on empty stomachs\u0026#39: Zimbabweans face worst economic crisis in a decadeHarvey Proctor vows to stand against Tom Watson at next general election in revenge for \u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 campaignDominic Cummings: Why Boris Johnson\u0026#39s adviser thinks Britain\u0026#39s civil service must learn from Manhattan ProjectBoris Johnson assembles youngest and most ethnically erse Cabinet in historyPopular climbing routes in French Alps becoming more dangerous due to climate change, say researchersArsenal\u0026#39s Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac targeted by knife-wielding moped robbersFaye Dunaway\u0026#39s big Broadway comeback show cancelled after she is fired moments before curtainNew online regulator should have powers to investigate app stores, NSPCC saysComment: This isn\u0026#39t a Government it\u0026#39s a campaign team determined to scare Parliament into complianceExtinction Rebellion abandon Heathrow protests as split in its ranks emergesBlunder sees Donald Trump appear with fake presidential seal mocking golf and Russia linksWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"music photographer denis oregancaptures glamour rock n roll","story":"As one of Britain’s top rock photographers over the past 45 years, Denis O’Regan has collaborated with legendary artists including David Bowie, Queen and the Rolling Stones, creating iconic images and capturing both the grit and the glamour of rock star life.

He had flown for 11 miles at speeds of up to 87 mph, 50 feet above the waves.Divers from the refuelling boat pulled him out of the water unhurt with his ‘Flyboard’, which he designed and built himself.Stéphane Denis, a member of Mr Zapata’s support team, said: “It is a huge disappointment. He made his rendez-vous with the refuelling boat, but the landing platform touched his ‘Flyboard’. That threw him off balance and he fell into the water.” Mr Denis added that he would make another attempt, probably within weeks.  It took him 10 minutes to reach the boat and if he had managed to strap on a new fuel pack and lift off again, he would have expected to reach St Margaret’s Bay, near Dover, in another 10 minutes. It would have been the first Channel crossing on a hoverboard.Franky Zapata stands on his jet-powered \u0026#39flyboard\u0026#39 as he takes off from Sangatte, northern FranceMr Zapata, a former jet-ski champion from Marseille, was reportedly furious at the failure. He blamed French maritime authorities who had refused to allow him to refuel in mid-air. He had wanted to refuel twice, once over French waters and another over UK waters.British authorities did not oppose the plan, but the French deemed it too dangerous. French commentators said the French refused because they were more concerned about safety, while the “Anglo-Saxons” were more relaxed, provided other people were not put at risk.  Mr Zapata, nicknamed “Flyman” by French media, had planned the attempt to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the first cross-Channel flight by Louis Blériot, the French aviation pioneer.During an early test flight when he was developing the turbo-powered ‘Flyboard’, two of his fingers were torn off after he collided with a wall and caught his hand in the turbines.He delighted French leaders by soaring over their heads at the Bastille Day military parade in Paris. Emmanuel Macron, the president, compared him to James Bond. Footage of the stunt was broadcast around the world.Game-changing ovarian cancer drug which extends survival by three years gets NHS green lightWomen still perform bulk of household chores, survey

At lunchtime there was a 3-hour queue to enter the pool. Then things turned nasty...Britain breaks July record - but falls short of all-time high of 38.5CLido stormed as Londoners seek relief from the sunTrain operators tell commuters not to travelWhy UK railways can\u0027t handle a heatwave - and how technology could helpThe best beer gardens in London for the heatwave ​Britain\u0027s famed inability to deal with extreme weather isn\u0027t funny anymore ​Heatstroke symptoms and how to keep cool in the hot weatherCommuters endured chaos and disruption on the railways as the UK sweltered on its hottest July day on record on Thursday.The hottest temperature recorded in the UK - 38.1C - was in Cambridge, where the Met Office has a monitoring station.While that figure is the highest temperature ever recorded in the UK in July, it falls just shy of 38.5C, the highest UK temperature of all time recorded in 2003.It is the second time ever meteorologists have recorded temperatures of more than 100F in the UK.Elsewhere, temperatures reached 37.9C (100.22F) in Heathrow and Kew Gardens.Police were called to Brockwell Park Lido after 500 people arrived to cool off, with waiting times for the pool hitting three hours at midday.The heat also means rail services have been thinned out, meaning strife for those looking to get to and from the capital for work.A reduced timetable in the South East came into force at midday as Network Rail implemented speed restrictions amid fears tracks could buckle in the heat if trains travel too fast.Speed limits on most commuter lines have been reduced from 60mph to 30mph.An information screen warns commuters of hot weather at Clapham Junction in London,But the extreme conditions also caused damage to overhead electric wires, blocking all lines between London and Luton.Overhead wire failures also caused disruption between London and Watford, between Preston and Carlisle and in the Birmingham area.Many operators have urged passengers not to travel as services are delayed and cancelled.One study found temperatures of 36.7C on the Underground\u0027s Central Line.It was not only the heat that caused disruption. Train services out of Britain\u0027s busiest station were suspended on Thursday evening after a man was seen chasing a dog along electrified tracks.A man on the railway tracks outside Waterloo station, London, looking for his dogAll lines in and out of London Waterloo were blocked at about 7pm due to trespass, South Western Railway said.Disruption is expected until the end of the day, it said on Twitter.Passengers said power had been switched off to trains on the line, which uses an electrified third rail.Video shared on social media showed a man running along the tracks at the approach to the station.We saw a dog running down the track and then, 20 seconds later, a man running after it, said passenger Adam Willmott, 23. The dog was much faster and the man was looking rather tired.He said his London-bound train had been stationary for more than 20 minutes with no power.We have no air conditioning and it is just getting hotter and hotter, he said. The train manager said he doesn\u0027t know when we will move.Network Rail\u0027s group director Nick King told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme on Thursday morning that the rail network was not engineered to cope with temperatures as high as 38C. He said: What we\u0027re saying is as a consequence of the record temp, we have to react to that because our tracks will expand quite significantly. That gives a potential for unsafe situations like buckled tracks.As a consequence, trains will have to run at a reduced speed and there will be fewer trains running.When asked why Nairobi and Mumbai could run trains effectively at temperatures of up to 50C but Britain could not, Mr King said: We set our railway around a norm UK temperature of 27C, so we stress our tracks to deal with movement in that range band.So we\u0027re seeing temperatures outside of our engineering norms. The scorching conditions may spark thunderstorms which could trigger travel delays, flash flooding, and power cuts, the Met Office said.The dangers of cooling off in lakes, rivers and the sea were highlighted by emergency services after the bodies of three people were pulled from the water after they reportedly got into difficulty swimming.Searches continue for someone seen in the River Thames near Waterloo, Scotland Yard said.Separately, a swimmer drowned while taking a cooling dip in the sea in East Sussex. Paramedics and police were called to Norman\u0027s Bay in Pevensey, shortly before lunchtime after a body was spotted floating in the water just off the beach.Rescuers who rushed to the scene managed to pull the victim onto the beach and attempted heart massage but the person was certified dead at the scene. A yellow weather warning was in force for most of England, except the south west, and parts of Scotland from 3pm on Thursday until 4am on Friday.Overnight lightning storms have already caused fires and rail disruption this week during the heatwave.London North Eastern Railway (LNER), which runs inter-city services on the East Coast Main Line, advised customers against travelling on Thursday.The Met Office has warned heatwaves are on the increase as a result of climate change.The scorching temperatures gripping the UK and much of Europe come against a backdrop of global warming of 1C since the Industrial Revolution driven by greenhouse gas emissions. Nine of the ten hottest days of the year have been recorded since 1990.Both Belgium and the Netherlands broke their all-time maximum temperature records on Wednesday, reaching 39.9.C and 39.1C respectively, the Met Office said.A topless commuter on the Victoria Line on ThursdayDr Mark McCarthy, Manager of National Climate Information Centre, said: “We don’t expect to be experiencing these extreme temperatures year on year.Climate change doesn’t mean we will be experiencing these temperatures year on year.What’s notable is we’re looking at these tendencies over longer time periods. What you notice about this list is that a lot of these temperatures are from recent decades.”Police had to be called to an outdoor swimming pool after hordes of overheating Londoners tried to force their way in.Around 500 people tried to storm Brockwell Lido in south-east London during Thursday\u0027s record-breaking heat.Tempers flared around midday when waiting times topped three hours.By around 1.30pm, a new record temperature of 36.9C (98.4F) had been set at Heathrow Airport.The politan Police said: Police were called to Brockwell Lido to reports of overcrowding.Officers attended. Security staff at the lido have closed the doors as a group of 500 people are trying to get in.The owners of the venue are advising people not to come as there is a three-hour waiting time.Brockwell Park lido where the public have been queueing since before it opened todayGauri Kangai posted a picture of the fracas on Twitter with the words No City for Keeping Cool.She added: Raises (questions) about design in cities for extreme climate instances like today.There were similar scenes elsewhere in the capital - with Parliament Hill Lido forced to refuse further entry just before noon due to overcrowding.Police were repeatedly forced to attend the pool after fights broke out in the queue, and eventually the Met decided to leave an officer effectively on guard to prevent any more disruption.The force said: Officers were first called to the venue at 09.49hrs when a number of minor scuffles broke out as swimmers queued to enter the lido.Further incidents of disorder broke-out throughout the day.A spokeswoman said there had been no arrests or any reported injuries, but added: Police remain in attendance to prevent a breach of the peace.Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said NHS staff were struggling as few lessons had been learned from last year\u0027s heatwaves and few hospitals are prepared for the impact of intense heat.He said overheated and exhausted staff are at greater risk of making errors.Last year, hospitals hired in large fans and coolers for a week or so but have got nothing long-term in place - they are purely reactive not proactive.Some better organisations bought in lots of bottled water and gave it to staff or brought round cooled drinks.To get drinks, staff would usually need to leave the ward to buy them.There is often nothing or very little in place for staff to get fluids on wards on an ad-hoc basis and they are expected only to drink in breaks which isn\u0027t right when temperature on wards are really high.Patient areas don\u0027t have coolers or ice machines due to infection concerns.Swimmers cool down by jumping into the River Swale at Richmond, North YorkshireA woman cools off in the water fountains in Battersea ParkA road in Empingham melting under the intense heatA rambler resting in the heatResidents in a city have been left without water on the hottest day of the year - after a main burst.People living in the east and north of Bristol have been given bottles of water by their supplier after the main burst on Thursday morning.Those affected live in the Speedwell, Eastville, Fishponds, to the east, and lower Horfield, to the north, supplier Bristol Water said.The firm said on Twitter: We are working as quickly as possible to restore your water supply and will post regular updates as we have them. Thank you for your patience.We are arranging bottled water for priority service customers and investigating locations for alternative water supplies. Thank you once again for you patience.Sharna Smith, from Bristol Water, explained why the main may have burst.She told a local radio station: With the weather being as hot as it has been we get ground movements. It\u0027s very likely ground movements has caused friction to increase and decrease the pipe size and unfortunately it\u0027s burst so we are working very hard here.Everyone is trying their best to get customers back into supply.Bristol Water said they will deliver water to priority customers such as the elderly and parents with young children.Want the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

Security staff at the lido have closed the doors as a group of 500 people are trying to get in.The owners of the venue are advising people not to come as there is a three-hour waiting time.Brockwell Park lido where the public have been queueing since before it opened todayGauri Kangai posted a picture of the fracas on Twitter with the words No City for Keeping Cool.She added: Raises (questions) about design in cities for extreme climate instances like today.There were similar scenes elsewhere in the capital - with Parliament Hill Lido forced to refuse further entry just before noon due to overcrowding.Police were repeatedly forced to attend the pool after fights broke out in the queue, and eventually the Met decided to leave an officer effectively on guard to prevent any more disruption.The force said: Officers were first called to the venue at 09.49hrs when a number of minor scuffles broke out as swimmers queued to enter the lido.Further incidents of disorder broke-out throughout the day.A spokeswoman said there had been no arrests or any reported injuries, but added: Police remain in attendance to prevent a breach of the peace.Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said NHS staff were struggling as few lessons had been learned from last year\u0027s heatwaves and few hospitals are prepared for the impact of intense heat.He said overheated and exhausted staff are at greater risk of making errors.Last year, hospitals hired in large fans and coolers for a week or so but have got nothing long-term in place - they are purely reactive not proactive.Some better organisations bought in lots of bottled water and gave it to staff or brought round cooled drinks.To get drinks, staff would usually need to leave the ward to buy them.There is often nothing or very little in place for staff to get fluids on wards on an ad-hoc basis and they are expected only to drink in breaks which isn\u0027t right when temperature on wards are really high.Patient areas don\u0027t have coolers or ice machines due to infection concerns.Swimmers cool down by jumping into the River Swale at Richmond, North YorkshireA woman cools off in the water fountains in Battersea ParkA road in Empingham melting under the intense heatA rambler resting in the heatResidents in a city have been left without water on the hottest day of the year - after a main burst.People living in the east and north of Bristol have been given bottles of water by their supplier after the main burst on Thursday morning.Those affected live in the Speedwell, Eastville, Fishponds, to the east, and lower Horfield, to the north, supplier Bristol Water said.The firm said on Twitter: We are working as quickly as possible to restore your water supply and will post regular updates as we have them. Thank you for your patience.We are arranging bottled water for priority service customers and investigating locations for alternative water supplies. Thank you once again for you patience.Sharna Smith, from Bristol Water, explained why the main may have burst.She told a local radio station: With the weather being as hot as it has been we get ground movements. It\u0027s very likely ground movements has caused friction to increase and decrease the pipe size and unfortunately it\u0027s burst so we are working very hard here.Everyone is trying their best to get customers back into supply.Bristol Water said they will deliver water to priority customers such as the elderly and parents with young children.Want the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

Its kit can be found in just about every Airbus jet, for example.\u0026nbspFootasylum could run a lot faster under JD’s wing after £90m takeoverCobham hit by US defence spending cutsAdvent’s offer represents a 34 per cent premium over Wednesday’s closing share price, and it looks like a shoo-in to get the 75 per cent support from shareholders that\u0026nbspit requires for the deal to go through.The premium looks like a tasty one, and the majority of its investors will likely sign up in a heartbeat.\u0026nbspFor a start, the board has backed it unanimously, as has Artemis, one of\u0026nbspits bigger institutional shareholders. While the company has found its feet of late, its recent history has not been entirely happy. It issued a string of profit warnings between 2015 and 2017. In the last of those years it tapped shareholders for an emergency £500m to help with a debt-mountain built up in part through a botched acquisition.\u0026nbspThe new shares, issued through the cash call, were priced at 75p. Investors who signed up and held on to them are getting 165p in cash from Advent. Cha-ching.\u0026nbspCould Cobham have got there on its own, though? The shares were at a higher level than that as recently as the beginning of 2016. It might seem like a tall order given Britain’s desperate political climate, but the question is rarely asked even when things are going well. The rule in the City is you take the money and run when it’s offered. \u0026nbspAnother rarely raised question, unless the company involved is a big household name, is whether the deal is a good one for this country.\u0026nbspIn the case of Cobham, the government may not even need to lie about this being an investment in Britain that shows off its vim.\u0026nbspAdvent has surely been assisted by the climate that government has created. Its behaviour has so tarnished Sterling that shares denominated in the UK’s currency are unnaturally cheap for overseas bidders, which can therefore afford to make their offers look generous.\u0026nbspWith the requirement to act like a good little vassal of the US, any muted objections to the deal will fall on deaf ears. There’ll be no question of using the slightly beefed up powers the government has to halt takeovers involving sensitive companies like this one.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

It highlights the the company’s key strength. It still has the capability to deliver mass\u0026nbspaudiences to advertisers in a way that’s almost unique. Love Island is beloved by the\u0026nbspmuch\u0026nbspcoveted 16- to 34-year-old\u0026nbspdemographic that is usually\u0026nbspin thrall to Netflix and YouTube. There’s nothing currently about that rivals the show’s\u0026nbsppopularity among its members.\u0026nbspITV boss criticises ‘simplifying link’ between Love Island and suicideLove Island to air twice in 2020 as winter series announced by ITV2Love Island: Counselling offered to contestants’ families by ITVBut Love Island also highlights the company’s weakness. Without it, where would ITV be?\u0026nbspOK, that’s a little unfair. There’s more to the company than just its most high-profile show.\u0026nbspThe main reason for the company’s shares taking flight was, in fact, because its results weren’t anything like as bad as the City had feared, and the company’s guidance had prepped it for.\u0026nbspBut despite Love Island and other hit shows, ad revenues were still down\u0026nbspby 5 per cent, ditto overall revenues, off by 7 per cent.\u0026nbspThe latter was in part because the money that its content producer ITV Studios brings in comes in fits and starts. There’ll be a lot more of it in the second half this year.The ads were partly down because of the UK’s awful political situation, but ITV still faces the long-term problem of them shifting online, taking its biggest revenue stream with them. It’s a process that looks set to carry on\u0026nbspeven if the broadcaster continues to find hits such as the aforementioned reality show or Bodyguard, or its other winning properties.To be fair, CEO Carolyn McCall has been actively pursuing ways to address the issue and ITV Digital’s offerings have done well on her watch. It delivered an 18 per cent rise in turnover this time around.\u0026nbspThere’s also the forthcoming BritBox streaming venture, in partnership with the BBC.\u0026nbspIt’s already in the US, where it has been doing well. ITV is now putting a great deal of effort into launching it on this side of the pond.\u0026nbspBut there are questions. The £5.99 monthly price tag is competitive (although the initially rumoured £5 might have ultimately delivered still more subscribers), and it is marketing distinctively British content.\u0026nbspBut it will, at least at first, be reliant on back catalogue, at a time when its partner is looking to extend the free iPlayer window to a year.\u0026nbspThe latter’s stake is only 10 per cent, with an option to raise it. That looks like a less than wholehearted commitment that could easily be jettisoned.\u0026nbspNetflix has become a juggernaut through investing billions in new content – as much as $15bn a year. Britbox is getting £65m over two (although that’s net of forecast subscriptions), and there’ll be no standalone shows at launch. Does it have enough to secure a niche as an additional extra, a second streaming subscription, which is the pitch, amid an increasingly crowded field?\u0026nbspIt’s worthy of note that Netflix is finding resistance from consumers to its price rises. They only have so much to spend.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

But there are plenty of other reasons that employees might feel welcome\u0026nbsphere, from the breakout areas populated by stuffed Shaun the Sheep, to the well-tended\u0026nbspgardens, where Nick Park often sits, pondering his latest creations, to the walls and cabinets lined with Baftas, Oscars and Cannes Lions for Wallace and Gromit and many of the other Aardman creations that are printed\u0026nbspin the memory of any British child of the Nineties.\u0026nbspLast year, those employees had one more reason to stay. On 10 November\u0026nbsp2018, the company announced that its founders, Peter Lord and Dave\u0026nbspSproxton, were selling 75 per cent of shares to a trust that would hold them on behalf of employees, turning Aardman into an employee-owned company.Stephanie Owen, a senior producer and trustee director, first heard about the plan at the company’s annual review in April last year. She had plenty of questions about employee ownership, which is still less well known than other company structures, but mostly, she felt proud.\u0026nbsp“I felt incredibly emotional and rather proud to be part of a company where the owners were taking such a bold and generous step to ensure the company’s legacy continued in the hands of the people who care so much about it –\u0026nbspthe partners, as we are now all called,” Owen\u0026nbspremembers.How one cooperative is improving lives with food in PrestonWhy co-operatives could be the answer to the UK’s social care crisisThere are now more than 370 employee-owned businesses in the UK and 200,000 employee-owners.

The second provides an income tax exemption for employees, allowing them to receive a tax-free bonus of up to £3,600 annually.This week, the Employee Ownership Association and Co-operatives UK joined together to call on the government to invest £2m\u0026nbspin the spending review to support the voluntary expansion of employee and worker-owned businesses.\u0026nbspThey point to evidence that shows that as UK productivity has declined, the productivity of the top employee-owned firms is rising by 7 per cent a year. Ed Mayo, secretary general of Co-operatives UK, says: “When it comes to reducing wealth inequality, driving employee engagement and tackling regional resilience, employee and worker ownership offers a proven solution.”Upstairs at Aardman, Dave Sproxton keeps a business book on his desk that partly inspired his decision: Beyond the Corporation: Humanity Working\u0026nbspby David Erdal, the chair of Tullis Russell, a paper manufacturing company based in Scotland. Erdal designed and led the employee buyout of the company, which was completed in 1994.Sproxton had been thinking and talking about succession plans for Aardman since 2013. The seeds of his interest in employee ownership were\u0026nbspsown much earlier when, as a geography undergraduate, he studied under a Marxist professor. “The tendency of\u0026nbspa company like ours with intellectual property of value is to get swallowed by Endemol, Disney or somewhere, who then take the properties and make them in another country,” he says. “About five employees go with them and the rest find themselves out of a job.”Sproxton dismissed the idea of becoming a cooperative, which gives every worker an equal share in the business, believing that it might not work in such a commercial environment. He landed on employee ownership through a trust, which is managed separately through a board. This model does not convey the same voting rights as full cooperative ownership, but can make employees a more active part of managing the business. “The culture of the place was already collaborative, as film-making is, so when an employee-ownership structure was mooted, I thought that could be a way forward,” he says.Aardman Animations at 40Now the transfer of shares is complete, Sproxton is focussing his attention on appointing a new managing director to replace him, so that he can move into a consultancy role. Meanwhile Peter Lord will remain creative director, working on a Shaun the Sheep movie due out later this year and Chicken Run 2, which is in development.“We’re not quitting yet,” the founders said in the statement announcing the new company structure. “But we are preparing for our future. This approach is the best solution we have found for keeping Aardman doing what it does best, keeping the teams in place and providing continuity for our highly creative culture. And of course, those that create value in the company will continue to benefit directly from the value they create.”Since the transition, Stephanie Owen has been elected by her colleagues to represent them at the executive board and the trustee board. The role is a step up from the previous workers’ council and has given employees more of a hand in shaping the business – including helping to choose a successor to\u0026nbspSproxton as managing director. “There is a new air of excitement and positive energy that the EO transition has brought,” Owen says. “There is also a sense of responsibility in the knowledge that ‘it’s our Aardman’ now and we all have a part to play in making it the best it can be.”wallis and gromit\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is more than double the 18.9 per cent currently charged on overdrafts with its standard current account and in line with some of the most expensive credit cards available.Nationwide will also no longer allow customers with its FlexPlus account a £250 overdraft without charges.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned daily fees on overdrafts, requiring lenders to charge through an annual interest rate instead by April 2020, following years of complaints by consumer groups that customers were being charged excessive fees.Although an interest rate is clearer than the confusing array of daily charges that banks levy and it can be compared with other types of borrowing, it is not necessarily cheaper, as Nationwide’s move demonstrates.Created with Sketch.Deutsche Bank: Sacked staff clear out their belongings Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonIn May, when the FCA announced what it described as the “biggest shake-up to the overdraft market for a generation”, it anticipated that lenders would attempt to recoup any loss of revenues by increasing interest rates among other changes.The regulator warned that the new rules could create “winners and losers” as banks change their overdraft charges to comply.The new rules also include a ban on charging different rates for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, intended to stop lenders saddling a small number of borrowers with large fees, which can in some cases be over 10 times higher than the cost of a payday loan.Other major high street lenders have yet to announce how they will respond.Overdraft fees slashed in radical shake-up of ‘dysfunctional’ marketOne-third of Nationwide’s customers who use their overdraft will see no change or a reduction in fees and interest because interest payable on small overdrafts will be less than the daily charges currently charges. Of the remaining two-thirds, Nationwide said, most will see a rise of 20p per day or less.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said overdraft charges from many providers had been “hideous” for some time.“All overdraft providers will have to charge via APR, so comparisons will now be easier.\u0026nbsp“For existing Nationwide customers though, there are winners and losers. Those with smaller overdrafts who are currently being charged will gain, as the cost is directly in proportion to the amount they’re overdrawn.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018The maker of electric cars also said it began preparations for the production of its Model Y, an all-electric SUV.When the model was unveiled in March, Mr Musk promised that it will ride “like a sports car” and will be “the safest mid-size SUV in the world by far”.The Model Y may become Tesla’s most important money spinner, given how popular SUVs have become in the US, Europe and Canada. Most SUVs still run on petrol, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative.The pressure on Tesla to become sustainably profitable is intense. Repeated large losses since its inception\u0026nbspand capital raising have\u0026nbspleft the company with a\u0026nbsphuge debt pile: it stood at $11.4bn at the end of the second quarter.Whether Tesla will move into the black this year is in doubt –\u0026nbspmany analysts think it will struggle to meet its 2019 deliveries target of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles.The US has reduced its tax incentive for electric car purchases and will phase it out entirely at the end of the year.But Tesla faces an even deeper problem, as Clement Thibault, an analyst at Investing, pointed out. “Does it matter how many cars you sell, if you can’t make a profit on them?”Tesla’s shares have lost more than 20 per cent of their value this year, while the Standard \u0026amp Poor’s 500 index has surged by as much.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He pointed out that the sharp fall in sales recorded in the June survey was at odds with a healthy rise in sales subsequently reported by government statisticians.However, the factors that have supported consumer spending this year may be starting to fade, he said. He pointed to a recent slowdown in employment growth and evidence from surveys that pay rises are running out of steam.In addition, with UK consumers saving a very low share of their income, they may “at the very least” want to stop dipping into their savings, especially given the uncertainty around Brexit, he said.“Meanwhile, lenders have cut back on the availability of unsecured consumer credit,” he added.The CBI survey was conducted between 27 June and 16 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A phone known as D42 will replace the iPhone XS, one known as D43 will replace the iPhone XS Max, and one called N104 will come in the place of the iPhone XR.Last year was the first time Apple released its iPhones in this line-up, with a large and small version of the premium model and then a cheaper medium-sized version. That same set-up looks set to be in place this year, according to the leak.Perhaps the most notable feature of the new phone is what won\u0027t change. The new phones are said to feature a Lightning port like the existing phones, rather than swapping to the USB-C that arrived on the iPad Pro last year and has long been rumoured to be coming to kill off the Lightning port as a charger.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018All three of the phones will also feature similar displays, with the same resolution as they have today.The leak chimes with previous reports that the biggest change on the outside of the phone will be the big camera bump on the back. That will be a large block of lenses that will feature three cameras arranged into a square shape.iPhone users urged to update old devices to latest iOS softwareThe third lens – a first for the iPhone – will include a new lens that will be able to take wide-angle photos, the report suggested. As well as letting people take wider photos, that will allow for a new feature called Smart Frame which will capture data outside of a traditional photo so that users can change the framing of it by using that same data.The front-facing camera will also receive an upgrade.They will also kill off one major feature, known as 3D Touch, which allowed people to press their phone screen harder and get new menu options. That was introduced on the iPhone 6s but never came to the iPads or the iPhone XR, and the new phones will also drop it – making way for similar tools that will be enabled by software, the report claimed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Maura\u0027s\u0026nbsppersistence led to some viewers on Twitter calling her out for \u0027pressuring\u0027 Curtis to \u0027do bits\u0027 with her. The pair later had an epic date, which was actually quite cute, but there was a harp present, which was a bit much.Tonight\u0027s episode had a lot of filler in it - montages and romantic ballads aplenty - presumably to make up for the fact that basically nothing happened. And it felt like the islanders were twiddling their thumbs a little, just waiting for the final. Aren\u0027t we all.India jokes that she\u0027s only in it for the £50kIn a sneak peek of the end of the episode that aired before an ad break, it looked like India suddenly had a personality transplant and announced that she was only on the show for the money. But then we saw the full\u0026nbspedit and it became clear she was joking. Phew. I just want Ovie to be happy.Catch up with all the action, as it happened, below...Catch up with last night\u0027s episode hereIt’s a hit, but Love Island shows the weakness of ITVAll the names Love Island contestants gave their \u0027babies\u0027Before tonight’s show kicks off in a couple of hours, let’s just refresh our memories of last night’s antics…The biggest talking point from last night has to be Jordan’s pursuit of India (who is with Ovie, a man carved by angels) and Anna’s subsequent wrath when she found out her boyfriend had been “cracking on” with another girl.Quote of the night from Anna: “I am a strong woman. I will never let someone bring me down and win.”It was the now-legendary (and extremely bizarre) \u0027babies episode\u0027 last night, where the islanders play mummies and daddies and become alarmingly attached to little dolls. Conclusion? Not exactly a documentary about model, or for that matter modern,\u0026nbspparenting.There was, of course, a mass dumping, which saw Anna and Jordan – much to Anna’s relief, it seemed – leaving the villa, as well as Harley and Chris.

There is also a clear political vibe, with commentary on Brexit, the NHS, mental health and how we communicate with each other all strong themes on many of the shortlisted entries.\u0026nbspThe shortlist follows a shake-up of the judging panel, which added Stormzy, Gaz Coombes, Annie Mac and Jorja Smith, and critic and Vice editor Tshepo Mokoena to the group of experts who will decide the winner at a ceremony later this year.See the full shortlist for this year’s Mercury Prize:Idles – Joy As An Act of Resistance\u0026nbspThe 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsFoals have been shortlisted for the third time, having previously appeared on 2013’s list with Holy Fire (losing out to James Blake – Overgrown) and 2010 with Total Life Forever, when the prize was won by The xx for their self-titled debut.\u0026nbspReviewing part one of Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost (the second half is being released this autumn), Mark Beaumont gave the album five stars and wrote: “It’s a dystopian vision becoming all the more real with every February heatwave, and Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 1 is a fitting vehicle.\u0026nbsp“Merging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2.”Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. There’s a strong showing for both UK rap and also an apparent surge in guitar music, with the majority of shortlisted acts making prominent use of the instrument, including Little Simz on her album GREY Area.\u0026nbspSimz and Dave’s albums were also awarded five stars apiece from The Independent. Of Psychodrama, The Independent commented: “A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity.\u0026nbsp“On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album.”This year’s “token jazz album”, as it has become known, is the 10-piece SEED Ensemble’s Driftglass, which combines South African jazz with Sixties soul and hip hop influences. The project is helmed by composer Cassie Kinoshi, who also plays alto sax in the jazz septet Nérija and in Afrobeat band Kokoroko. Driftglass’s title is taken from writer Samuel R Delany’s image of glass fragments washed by tides, which Kinoshi adopted for the album as a metaphor for how the tides of improvisation form compositions.Notable omissions include James Blake\u0027s Assume Form\u0026nbspalong with albums by Florence + the Machine, AJ Tracey, Lucy Rose and previous winner Skepta. As per previous years, metal is ignored by the prize and so critically acclaimed and commercially successful albums by artists including Bring Me the Horizon, Black Peaks, Architects and Employed to Serve have been left off this year\u0027s list.\u0026nbspFoals interview: ‘Brexit feels like an act of self-harm’Little Simz interview: ‘If you get offended by me, that’s on you’Dave jokes he can ‘retire now’ following Thiago Silva shout-outGeoff Taylor, Chief Executive of BPI - home to the Hyundai Mercury Prize, said: “These 12 albums are essential listening!

That is more than double the 18.9 per cent currently charged on overdrafts with its standard current account and in line with some of the most expensive credit cards available.Nationwide will also no longer allow customers with its FlexPlus account a £250 overdraft without charges.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned daily fees on overdrafts, requiring lenders to charge through an annual interest rate instead by April 2020, following years of complaints by consumer groups that customers were being charged excessive fees.Although an interest rate is clearer than the confusing array of daily charges that banks levy and it can be compared with other types of borrowing, it is not necessarily cheaper, as Nationwide’s move demonstrates.Created with Sketch.Deutsche Bank: Sacked staff clear out their belongings Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonIn May, when the FCA announced what it described as the “biggest shake-up to the overdraft market for a generation”, it anticipated that lenders would attempt to recoup any loss of revenues by increasing interest rates among other changes.The regulator warned that the new rules could create “winners and losers” as banks change their overdraft charges to comply.The new rules also include a ban on charging different rates for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, intended to stop lenders saddling a small number of borrowers with large fees, which can in some cases be over 10 times higher than the cost of a payday loan.Other major high street lenders have yet to announce how they will respond.Overdraft fees slashed in radical shake-up of ‘dysfunctional’ marketOne-third of Nationwide’s customers who use their overdraft will see no change or a reduction in fees and interest because interest payable on small overdrafts will be less than the daily charges currently charges. Of the remaining two-thirds, Nationwide said, most will see a rise of 20p per day or less.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said overdraft charges from many providers had been “hideous” for some time.“All overdraft providers will have to charge via APR, so comparisons will now be easier.\u0026nbsp“For existing Nationwide customers though, there are winners and losers. Those with smaller overdrafts who are currently being charged will gain, as the cost is directly in proportion to the amount they’re overdrawn.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its magnetic pull makes it even more intriguing,” Mr Ashok said.“However, we need to wait till the department sends experts who can study the object and arrive at a definitive conclusion.”Meteoroids are objects in space which range in size from dust grains to small asteroids, according to Nasa.When these so-called “space-rocks” survive the trip through the Earth’s atmosphere and arrive on the ground, they are known as meteorites.Relatively small meteorites, where the rock measures only a few metres across at most, are thought to be relatively common.The Earth’s terrestrial record of larger impacts is unclear,\u0026nbspbecause craters are often obliterated by erosion, burial and plate tectonics.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Another flame flew out of the top of the rocket, as can be seen on the video.The rocket itself appeared to survive without problems, but it is just the latest in a run of issues. It came a week after the Starhopper craft flew a fireball out of its bottom during another test.It was the first time that SpaceX has allowed one of the tests to be streamed.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018The maker of electric cars also said it began preparations for the production of its Model Y, an all-electric SUV.When the model was unveiled in March, Mr Musk promised that it will ride “like a sports car” and will be “the safest mid-size SUV in the world by far”.The Model Y may become Tesla’s most important money spinner, given how popular SUVs have become in the US, Europe and Canada. Most SUVs still run on petrol, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative.The pressure on Tesla to become sustainably profitable is intense. Repeated large losses since its inception\u0026nbspand capital raising have\u0026nbspleft the company with a\u0026nbsphuge debt pile: it stood at $11.4bn at the end of the second quarter.Whether Tesla will move into the black this year is in doubt –\u0026nbspmany analysts think it will struggle to meet its 2019 deliveries target of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles.The US has reduced its tax incentive for electric car purchases and will phase it out entirely at the end of the year.But Tesla faces an even deeper problem, as Clement Thibault, an analyst at Investing, pointed out. “Does it matter how many cars you sell, if you can’t make a profit on them?”Tesla’s shares have lost more than 20 per cent of their value this year, while the Standard \u0026amp Poor’s 500 index has surged by as much.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

cabinet minister admitted, earlier this year, that he had failed to register income from tenants after he moved out of his plush central London accommodation when he entered the cabinet.Now the Commons’ committee on standards has gone further by concluding the top barrister “unintentionally” misled it about the date when the rent was first received.“Mr Cox, as attorney general, is the chief

reappointed as attorney general by Boris Johnson, acknowledged in January this year that he should have registered the rental income from the previous September.When he apologised, the parliamentary standards commissioner “exercised her discretion” to deal with the matter without a referral to the standards committee, which oversees MPs’ behaviour.However, she noted it was not the first time Mr Cox had registered thousands of pounds in income later than Commons rules allow – having failed to declare £400,000 in outside earnings for legal work in 2016.It then became clear that the attorney general should have registered the financial interest in the property from November 2017 – “10 months earlier than the date which he had given to the commissioner” – triggering a referral.Created with

report, the committee says, of the two errors, “the first arose from an oversight and the second from a genuine misunderstanding”.“It accepts, as does the commissioner, that there was no intention to deceive,” the report concludes – while pointing to the need to “set a good example”.It states: “Mr Cox should at the earliest opportunity apologise in writing to the house, through the committee, for having registered a financial interest late and for having, albeit unintentionally, supplied wrong information about the date at which the interest became registerable.”Geoffrey Cox is Brexit’s

The overall decline marks the longest period of falling sales since 2011.“Despite the recent pick-up we’ve seen in households’ real earnings, the sun is clearly not shining on the British high street,” said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, which represents British businesses.Strong growth in grocers’ sales was outweighed by steep falls at department stores, clothing retailers and other shops.Another measure, which strips out seasonal variations in sales, also pointed to weakness: a balance of -20 per cent of retailers said sales were good for the time of year.\u0026nbspCompared with recent lows, firms expect\u0026nbspa slight pick-up in their fortunes in August, predicting sales will be broadly flat on a year ago.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson waves as he enters 10 Downing Street following his appointment as Prime Minster by the Queen.

He pointed out that the sharp fall in sales recorded in the June survey was at odds with a healthy rise in sales subsequently reported by government statisticians.However, the factors that have supported consumer spending this year may be starting to fade, he said. He pointed to a recent slowdown in employment growth and evidence from surveys that pay rises are running out of steam.In addition, with UK consumers saving a very low share of their income, they may “at the very least” want to stop dipping into their savings, especially given the uncertainty around Brexit, he said.“Meanwhile, lenders have cut back on the availability of unsecured consumer credit,” he added.The CBI survey was conducted between 27 June and 16 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”“Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma.

In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters.

It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”“Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab626 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive.

City infrastructure buckled and broke, government buildings shut down\u0026nbspand fountains filled with people\u0026nbspas  the second heatwave in less than a month swept across northern Europe.Not since 1947 had the temperature risen above 40C\u0026nbspin the French capital, but at 4.32pm\u0026nbspthe national weather service registered a new record temperature of 42.6C.Paris was just one of 20 departments placed on red alert in the country but it was within the limestone confines of the capital that the heat was felt most fiercely.Ground temperatures were closer to 50C\u0026nbspthanks to a\u0026nbspphenomenon known as the “urban heat island”. The\u0026nbspeffect\u0026nbspmeans that during periods of extreme heat the city is unable to cool down for days at a time\u0026nbspbecause the roads and buildings that spend all day absorbing the heat then act as radiators during the night.Thursday was the fourth –\u0026nbspand many hope final – day of this steadily building heatwave, and by 10am\u0026nbsp#AlerteRouge\u0026nbspwas already trending on Twitter.Created with Sketch.Paris swelters during hottest day in its history Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Jardins du Trocadero became an oasis for Parisians and tourists on the hottest day in the city\u0027s historyA pigeon cools down in a puddle by the fountains at Jardins du Trocadero in Paris, 25 July, 2019Temperatures reached close to 50C in some parts of Paris on 25 July, 2019, though the official record temperature was measured at 42.6CTemperatures got so high in Paris that Slushy machines melted in the heatPeople cool down in the fountains near the Eiffel Tower in ParisThe Jardins du Trocadero in Paris filled with tourists and residents on the hottest day in the city\u0027s historyThe temperature in the Paris metro reached up to 43C during the heatwaveTicket machines for the Paris  ceased to function in the extreme heatThe Jardins du Trocadero became an oasis for Parisians and tourists on the hottest day in the city\u0027s historyA pigeon cools down in a puddle by the fountains at Jardins du Trocadero in Paris, 25 July, 2019Temperatures reached close to 50C in some parts of Paris on 25 July, 2019, though the official record temperature was measured at 42.6CTemperatures got so high in Paris that Slushy machines melted in the heatPeople cool down in the fountains near the Eiffel Tower in ParisThe Jardins du Trocadero in Paris filled with tourists and residents on the hottest day in the city\u0027s historyThe temperature in the Paris metro reached up to 43C during the heatwaveTicket machines for the Paris  ceased to function in the extreme heatTrains were cancelled or forced to travel at reduced speeds due to fears the tracks would warp, while some metro stations saw ticket barriers seize up in the heat.“I’ve never seen anything like this,” said an RATP worker at Invalides station, who had no choice but to let passengers travel for free due to malfunctioning turnstiles. “It’s never been so hot that things have just broken.”At midday, several prefectures around the city announced they were closing for the day due to a lack of air conditioning in the buildings.During the most intense hours of the heatwave that followed, city streets were deserted as\u0026nbspponds and fountains transformed\u0026nbspinto public paddling pools. Others sought refuge in the frozen sections of supermarkets, some of which had run out of water due to an ill-timed viral message that spread across WhatsApp earlier this week, claiming the city’s water supply had been poisoned.Public authorities were forced to put out a response to rubbish\u0026nbspthe fears, together with hundreds of warnings about the actual dangers posed by the heat.\u0026nbsp(The last time the country suffered an intense heatwave similar to this was in 2003, when more than 15,000 people died.)Beyond the new colour-coded heat alert system, efforts to prevent a similar catastrophe have included volunteers handing out water and sunscreen to homeless people, as well as messages across television, radio and social media urging people to “hydrate!”It was a similar story across northern Europe, where one by one temperature records tumbled on Thursday. Holland beat its national record that had stood since 1944 with a reading of 39.3C in Eindhoven, while a temperature of 40.7C in Beitem broke Belgium’s record.Inside the ‘oven’ of the Tour de France, where lungs and bodies burnDespite the severity of this latest heatwave, climate scientists warn that such events are becoming the new normal. A study last month by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research revealed that the five hottest summer in Europe since 1500 have come since 2002.Human-caused climate change is the biggest reason for this, according to a landmark study published a year after the 2003 heatwave. The research carried out by the Met Office and scientists at the University of Oxford claimed that the environmental damage caused by humans has made extreme heat events twice as likely to occur.So while it took more than seven decades to break the city’s record temperature its unlikely to be another 70-plus years before it falls again.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Other British naval assets in the region will be called upon for assistance if that becomes necessary, according to defence officials.The escorting project is being coordinated by the Department for International\u0026nbspTrade, which is passing on details of the vessels which need protection to the Ministry of Defence. The rules of engagement allow the Royal Navy to take the measures required to protect British lives and property.Shipping industry sources say that at least eight tankers, including those carrying chemicals, are effectively stranded in the Gulf region since the British-flagged Stena Impero was captured by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards on 19 July. Following that seizure, the security alert for UK shipping in the area was raised to Level 3, indicating that attempted interdiction was likely and imminent.Then-foreign secretary\u0026nbspJeremy Hunt, announced earlier this\u0026nbspweek that the UK was putting together a European naval contingent to guard ships in the waters\u0026nbsp– one of the most important oil shipping routes in the world.Created with Sketch.In photos: British-flagged tanker seized by Iran Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A speedboat of Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guard moving around the British-flagged oil tanker Stena ImperoCrew members of the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero, that was seized by Iran in the Strait of HormuzA satellite image of the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas reveals the presence of the seized British oil tanker, the Stena Impero on July 22Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claims to have seized Stena Impero at the Strait of Hormuz with 23 crew on board on 20 JulyIranian Revolutionary Guards patrolling around the captured British-flagged tanker Stena Impero as it\u0027s anchored off the Iranian port city of Bandar AbbasA satellite image of the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas reveals the presence of the seized British oil tanker, the Stena Impero on July 22A speedboat of the Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guard moves around a British-flagged oil tanker Stena ImperoA speedboat of Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guard moving around the British-flagged oil tanker Stena ImperoCrew members of the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero, that was seized by Iran in the Strait of HormuzA satellite image of the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas reveals the presence of the seized British oil tanker, the Stena Impero on July 22Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claims to have seized Stena Impero at the Strait of Hormuz with 23 crew on board on 20 JulyIranian Revolutionary Guards patrolling around the captured British-flagged tanker Stena Impero as it\u0027s anchored off the Iranian port city of Bandar AbbasA satellite image of the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas reveals the presence of the seized British oil tanker, the Stena Impero on July 22A speedboat of the Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guard moves around a British-flagged oil tanker Stena ImperoThe project is due to be addressed by the new foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and defence secretary Ben Wallace, and their aides, but contingency planning is going ahead.The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said on Tuesday that: “We are setting up a\u0026nbspEuropean initiative with Britain and Germany, to ensure that there is a mission to monitor and observe maritime security in the Gulf.”He stopped short, however, of backing the British call for the deployment of naval forces, saying it would be an “observation” mission for the purpose of “de-escalation”.Mr Hunt had offered to secure the release of the Iranian-owned tanker Grace 1, which was boarded by Royal Marines earlier in July, in return for a pledge by Tehran that it would not deliver its cargo of oil to the Assad regime in Syria.Is Britain making itself a target in the Gulf?Iranian diplomatic sources said they were unsure whether the offer continues under the new government of Boris Johnson.A British government spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “In response to the heightened threat to commercial shipping in the Gulf, the Department for Transport changed its guidance on Friday 19 July to advise ships not to sail through the area. Freedom of navigation is crucial for the global trading system and world economy, and we will do all we can to defend it.“The Department for Transport has updated its advice to confirm that the Royal Navy has been tasked to accompany British-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz, either inidually or in groups, should sufficient notice be given of their passage.”Bob Sanguinetti, chief executive\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspthe UK Chamber of Shipping, welcomed the government announcement.\u0026nbsp“Freedom of navigation is a fundamental principle of international maritime law. The UK Chamber of Shipping welcomes the government’s decision to accompany and protect British-flagged ships passing through the Straits of Hormuz.“The announcement is an encouraging step to ensuring this fundamental principle is upheld. This move will provide some much-needed safety and reassurance to our shipping community in this uncertain time.

I could see the young children clinging on to each other,” he tells\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspfrom Idlib.\u0026nbsp“The older child was still clinging on to the baby. We rushed them to al-Shami hospital but they were running out of blood supplies and had to take them to Idlib hospital. “I stayed with the children, praying they would be safe.”Sonia\u0026nbspKhush, Save the Children’s Syria response director, describes the situation in Idlib as “a nightmare”.“The injuries we are seeing are horrific. It’s clear that once again children have been killed and injured in indiscriminate attacks,” she says.\u0026nbsp“The children of northwest Syria have been caught in violent conflict for 80 days with no lull. They have been denied education, food, healthcare and forced to sleep under the trees in open fields for months now,” Khush adds.The Syrian army, backed by its ally Russia, launched an offensive in late April aimed at retaking key roads and trade routes around Idlib and northern Hama, which the government sees as vital to consolidating its control over the north of the country.The renewed violence has sent waves of civilians fleeing from areas near the front lines of the battle to towns and villages further north, where aid groups were already struggling to deal with more than a million displaced people from all over Syria.Doctors in Idlib will no longer share coordinates of hospitals with UNThis week, violence has dramatically spiked. The United Nations said that Monday was one of the deadliest days for civilians since the offensive began almost three months ago. At least 59 civilians were killed that day alone, and more than 100 women, children and men were injured, following a succession of deadly airstrikes in southern Idlib.“Some of the dead bodies were torn into pieces or burnt beyond recognition. Many of the victims were women and children, some of them suffering the most horrific injuries,” says Mark Cutts, the UN’s deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis.\u0026nbspCutts describes the increased violence as “part of a wave of new attacks on critical civilian infrastructure across northwest Syria in recent months, including health facilities, schools, water plants, and bakeries”.He adds\u0026nbspthat the UN has\u0026nbspdocumented more than 400\u0026nbspcivilian deaths since April. The actual toll may be much higher.\u0026nbspIdlib represents the last area held by the armed opposition to Assad’s rule, following the defeat of the fragmented rebels in the south of the country.\u0026nbspGovernment forces began amassing around the edges of the territory in September 2018, prompting the United Nations to warn of a “bloodbath” if the offensive went ahead.An attack appeared to have been averted at the last minute by an agreement between Turkey and Russia –\u0026nbspbut that soon unravelled. As part of that deal, Turkey was tasked with using its influence in the province, where it backs a number of rebel groups and has troops on the ground, to force extremist groups to withdraw from a “buffer zone”.The largest of those groups is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), led by the former Syrian offshoot of al-Qaeda and classified as a terror group by the United Nations. In the time since the deal was announced, HTS strengthened its control over Idlib.

Both my professional and social and family time gets booked up a long way in advance and then you have to be strict about it.”His website says he is the first MP in modern times to win a horse race after riding to victory at Newmarket in August .He also claims to have played the most northerly game of cricket on record, and succumbed to frostbite en route to the Pole.In February , the minister launched an app - called Matt Hancock - on the iOS and Android s.It is packed with cringeworthy posts advertising the MPs constituency activities and encouraging the public to connect with him.Fans who join up are met with a video message from the minister.They can then view a large gallery of pictures and videos of Mr Hancock, updates about his work, and an archive of his speeches.People can also get in touch with each other, and users were quick to point out this feature of the app is almost identical to Facebook.Within hours the app was swamped with jokers and fake profiles with names such as Donald Trump and Theresa May.Users compared it to a scene from The Thick Of It, and even his parliamentary colleagues began taking the mick.One Twitter user joked: I actually met my girlfriend on the Matt Hancock app but we tell people we met at a bar.Mr Hancock was forced to post a message insisting the service was aimed at my West Suffolk constituents.But the minister - who oversees data protection policy - faced humiliation after claims the app breaches online privacy rules.Users downloading it on iPhones said it was accessing their photos and data even after they refused it permission to do so.A spokeswoman for Mr Hancock’s constituency office said the app “uses standard Apple technology, for example iOS photopicker technology for access to the camera”.Mr Hancock denied the app had a bug, saying it had been fully certied by Apple.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In other words, both the No Deal preparation and the proposed deal must be realistic.This is where his key Brexit lieutenants Dominic Cummings and David Frost come in.They might be backroom appointments but they are as —not more — important to the success of Boris’s premiership as the Cabinet appointments he has made.Cummings is a unique figure in Westminster. He is interested in getting things done with little regard to what people think of him and the political niceties.It is thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch that Cummings has attracted something close to celebrity status in political circles. Cumberbatch played Cummings in the TV drama Brexit: The Uncivil War.He captured brilliantly Cummings’ drive and determination to win as the campaign chief for Vote Leave, and the fact he doesn’t care whose ego he ruffles in the process.In his new job, Cummings’ determination is already clear.Yesterday he was meant to be on the operating table under general anaesthetic.But once the offer came from Boris, he cancelled the operation. I am told he won’t have it done now until after October , Boris’s deadline for getting Brexit done.Cummings came in because the chance of getting the Vote Leave team back together to deliver Brexit after three years of drt simply had to be taken. The big challenge for this team is to get the UK ready for a No Deal Brexit.Cummings is well suited to his task. He knows how Whitehall works and how to succeed despite intense opposition he drove through Michael Gove’s Free Schools, which have proved hugely successful, against the objections of the educational establishment.Strikingly, in Boris’s new Government it is now Gove who is in charge of the No Deal planning.Getting the logistics and the necessary contingency plans sorted is one aspect of No Deal planning, and one that was shamefully neglected under Mrs May. But there also needs to be a political strategy for it.Many in the EU are convinced — thanks to the antics of Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond and co — that Parliament will block No Deal.Or thatthe UK did leave without a deal on Halloween, it would come crawling back by Christmas.So they reckon there is no need to compromise as No Deal either won’t happen or will be only a temporary affair.The best way to deal with both the Parliamentary opposition to No Deal and the belief that the UK would come crawling back is for Boris to take a lead in the polls.If it was clear that a general election would lead to a majority for Boris, then Parliament would be less likely to throw obstacles in his way.That’s why Boris, in his Downing Street speech, tried to address the issues that cost the Tories their majority in : Social care, schools funding and police cuts.If the EU thought that Boris could do No Deal, and could politically sustain it, then it would have to decide whether it was prepared to compromise to avoid No Deal.The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, would have to decide whether it is worth sticking with a backstop that is going to cause the very thing it was meant to avoid, a hard border on the island of Ireland.Varadkar would also have to consider whether he really wants to go through with No Deal when it would do more damage to the Irish economy than the UK’s. This is where David Frost comes in.No, not the late, great TV personality but the former Foreign Office diplomat who is going to be Boris’s point man for negotiations with the EU.Frost knows his way round the chancelleries of Europe, he is a former Foreign Office Europe Director and he also knows what Boris wants on Brexit.He was his special adviser when Boris was Foreign Secretary and was there when Boris decided to quit over Mrs May’s Chequers plan.His role is to craft a Brexit agreement that delivers what Boris thinks the UK needs AND one that has a chance of being accepted by the EUthe alternative is No Deal. This isn’t going to be easy, and it isn’t going to be done quickly.Those involved admit thatthe EU is going to blink, it will not be until the October EU Council at the earliest, which is just two weeks away from the October  deadline. As one of those working in the new No puts it: “Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride.”But after years in which the EU thought they had the measure of the British Prime Minister, we now have a team who might just have what it takes to pull Brexit back from the brink. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But by November , this should be his priority.We are misleading our young people. Far too many -year-olds go to university and end up mired in debt, with rotten degrees in stupid subjects. While all students have to scrimp and save to get through their three years.Here’s what I would doI were Education Secretary.End all tuition fees right now. Make university education absolutely free, and make sure those who go get decent living grants.How do we pay for that  Easy. Cut the number of people going to university by  per cent. Not everyone is academically minded. University should be only for those who are.Back when I went to uni only ten per cent of my peer group got in.But for the rest there were apprenticeships. Learning in the workplace. And those sorts of options should be considered not inferior to university, but absolutely equal. And the benefits stressed to the kids.Three years after leaving school a university kid will be earning nothing. If you’ve been on an apprenticeship for three years you’ll be earning a decent whack.We have over-stressed the importance and attraction of a college education to our young people, given them unrealistic expectations and made them pay through the nose for it. And at the same time we’ve devalued education by doing this.So there’s the challenge, Boris. Get on to the private sector and get some more apprenticeships up and running.And close down the awful former polytechnics charging a king’s ransom for a crap degree.ONE of the best things about BoJo becoming Prime Minister is that the perpetually screeching Yasmin Alibhai-Brown has vowed to leave the country.Brown loathes the white English working class.So it was always a mystery to me why she stayed in the country. Seeing as there are quite a lot of white, English, working-class people.Anyway, she vowed to get the hell outJohnson became PM.Trouble is, people say stuff like this but rarely act on it.I suggest we set up a crowdfunding page for her plane ticket and maybe throw in some extra money for en-route snacks and stuff.Off you go to Heathrow, Yazza.I MADE a list a few weeks ago about the  things I most dislike in the world.At No was Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals.At No was Taylor Swt.And No was cats .So take a guess as to what new film I’m not going to be watching any time soon It’s my nightmare, all wrapped up in two hours.CARL BEECH made a series of outrageous claims of sexual abuse, torture and murder by members of the old Conservative establishment.This serial liar and fantasist will soon be sentenced for his crimes.The reason the police believed this madman is because they have been told they must.

You can’t police everything, surely “It’s clear the lake isn’t manned on a Monday so parents know to properly accompany their children on that day or avoid the lake altogether.“Labelling the lake unsafe seems a bit shortsighted...Surely the parents should be shouldered with the responsibility of their child’s welfare, particularlythey choose to swim outside the designated guarded times.”Ant Westgarth said: “We are in an age where common sense has been removed from the equation.“Many parents just do not think, this is not a paddling pool it’s a lake, why would you let your child go inyou can’t swim yourself.”“If there are no leguards do not swim there, go to a public baths or lido.”The revamp of the Georgian park - one of London’s oldest and largest - cost more than £.m, with £.m coming from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £m from Lewisham Council.The lake is  metres long and reaches depths of up to . metres and will also be used for kayaking and other water sports.A spokesman for Lewisham Council said: “The public response to the redevelopment of Beckenham Place Park has been fantastic.

Columba sent a man across the River Ness after stories of a “water beast” had circulated. It’s said that while the man was swimming he was approached by a beast but Columba made the sign of the cross and told the animal to “go no further”.George SpicerModern day interest in the beast was largely sparked by a sighting in July  by George Spicer and his we when they claimed a most extraordinary form of animal crossed the road in front of their car.Surgeon’s photographPerhaps the best-known picture of Nessie is the ‘Surgeon’s photograph’ which was published in April , supposedly showing the animals head and long neck. According to the photographer Robert Kenneth Wilson, he managed to capture the image while he was looking at the lake. The image though was exposed as a huge hoax in the  book, Nessie – the Surgeon’s Photograph Exposed.Holmes videoLab technician Gordon Holmes claimed he had managed to film the monster in  which he described as this jet black thing, about  metreslong, moving fairly fast in the water. Both BBC Scotland and STV aired the footage at the time which marine biologist Adrian Shine described as among “the best footage [he had] ever seen.”Some distance from the two objects, in the centre of the frame, a larger object can be seen which is a passing boat.They are seen moving through the water, but many believe they could easily be logs caught in the waves.Eoin said: “I have never seen two objects so close to each other on the webcam before and I have been watching for years. Their shape in the water is very strange.“What are they, I dont know. They could be two Nessies.”Eoin claims he has now spotted the Loch Ness Monster four times, three times in  alone.Takala, a scientist who has been researching Loch Ness for over  years, said: There has been a slight increase in surface temperatures in Loch Ness due to climate change.It is possible that a cold blooded creature like Nessie may be encouraged toand or stay longer in the warming waters of Loch Ness. Ive always believed there has to be a family of unknown creatures in the loch, albeit a small one.Its too much of a stretch to believe that a single creature can live for hundreds,not thousands of years or more.Also, there are cave like formations near Urquhart Castle, known as Edwards Deep and no attempt has ever been made to seethese are navigable.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But what does it actually mean for Britain - read on to find out What happens next in Brexit  Boris Johnson has demanded the complete removal of the so-called Irish backstop as the key objective in future Brexit negotiations. This puts him on a collision course with Brussels with the EUaposs Brexit chief Michel Barnier who has branded the move unacceptable. Mr Johnsonaposs Thursday evening call with Commission President Jean Claude Junker - while essential - is unlikely to have changed the EUaposs stance that negotiations on Britainaposs withdrawal are closed. Any hope for this strategy will force Johnson to make strong allies in the EU who are willing to go to bat to see the policy changed.    Essential to this will be Irish PM Leo Varadkar. But Johnson hasnapost yet scheduled a meeting with Varadkar, who has said that leaving with No Deal was a British threat.” He also added that without a backstop, there would be no free trade deal between the EU and the UK. Europe will not change its policy without Varadkaraposs support - so expect to see lots of Team Johson doing a lot of lobbying across the Irish sea.  Does his plan have the support of Parliament   No. But it is not quite clear what effect that may have. The government argue that Britain is leaving the EU - per international law - on October  do or die in the words of the PM. But a majority of MPs have rejected No Deal and with Boris enjoying a majority of just two votes things arenapost looking rosy for his plan. That is before you factor in the  ministers - many of them said to be furious - who he sacked in the biggest reshuffle in modern British political history. But although Johnsonaposs plans donapostapos have the support of MPs they may be unable to stop them - needing to pass wither a No Confidence motion in his government or pass their own bill explicitly ruling it out. With Parliament now not sitting until September they almost certainly donapost have time - without a breakthrough. But evenit looked likely Johnson has not ruled out simply stopping Parliament sitting in a bid to force the country to crash out of the EU.     Are we headed for a general election   It is looking more likely - especially as Johnsonaposs government is trapped between the EU and Parliament, neither willing to compromise with his views. But for an election to happen either Tories would have to vote for it or Labour would have to defeat the government in a No Confidence vote. The earliest possible date it could happen by is October  - or just six days before we are supposed to leave the EU. Labour say they are ready and waiting for a general election. And Johnson team - although denying that they want any public vote before Brexit - is packed with Vote Leave alumni both in the cabinet seats and among the backroom staff who masterminded the campaignaposs shock  win. Who would win any election  If it were held today the real answer is probably no one and it could just be a time-consuming route to more deadlock. Neither the Conservatives nor Labour could feel confident about winning an overall majority based on their performances in the polls. Brexit has seen both parties lose voters - Tory and Labour Leavers to Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party, and Remainers to the Lib Dems or Greens.  Professor of Politics and elections guru John Curtice has said that British politics is undergoing a dramatic sht after we failed to leave on  March.

George aposGeordieapos Walker died at Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast this week after he was found collapsed in his home on July .The -year-old has no known family members and lived by himself for the last  years of his le, Belfast Live reported.As the city prepares to put him to rest Cecil Wilson, who lived next to Geordie, remembered an old friend. The -year-old said: Geordie was always the lonesome one on the street. “The reason for that was Geordie’s sister Lily died very young. “I don’t know what happened, but I remember the horses coming to the street, we had never seen horses on a hearse. “We couldn’t believe it when we saw the coffin going in, it was scary at the time. “After the daughter died, his motherwas a changed woman. I know she had a husband , but Geordie was her le.    “If he wasn’t home at a certain time from school she would have been going round to seehe was there. If Geordie went on the road on a message, she’d have gone looking him - so he never played football or run about with friends. “He always sat in his mummy’s door and she always sat on her wee stool. He went on walks in the day and would come back at night. “They lived in Keatley Street then, that’s where I was born and reared and that’s where Geordie was born and reared. “When they knocked the houses down Geordie went to live in Harvey Street and we went to live in McMaster Street - but we were only actually one street away.” When Geordieaposs parents died several decades ago he was left with no close family. Cecil said his parents took Geordie under their wing, a kindness the pensioner repaid with generous gts. “My mother would have cooked for him when his mother died - she got him his shopping and did his ironing for the next  years and then when my mother died, my father did it,” he continued. “Geordie couldn’t have cooked nothing. “When my mother died he would have sat and talked to my father for hours, but what they talked I will never know.” While he was a smart pupil, Geordie left school at  and went to work at Harland and Wolff shipyard. There he worked on the cranes and in the yard until he took redundancy. “He was a friendly fella, but he was not a mixer. He was a great guy, but a hard guy to read,” Cecil continued. “He was in the shipyard all his le. He worked on the cranes and then he just helped about the yard. He took his redundancy when he was in his s.” Geordie enjoyed walking, sweet treats and a bargain. “He was the most generous fella you would have ever met in your le,” Cecil added. “If a kid was playing in the street he would call them over and give them a handful of sweets - but he wouldn’t say nothing to them or anything. “He had a heart of corn. He was happy as long as he had a pocket full of sweets and a house full of grapes and stuff and called into the fish shop - that was Geordie.” "},{"url":null,"title":"girl goes out adidas leggings","story":"NewsWoman goes out in Adidas leggings and ends up with leg tanned with brand logoDanielle Viagus-Foster removed her bottoms to discover she had the name of a sportsware company burnt onto her legShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsThe sportswear logo was scorched into her skin \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA sportswear fan was shocked to take her leggings off at the end of a long day in the sun to discover a logo scorched onto her limb.

What she didnapost realise - as the sun beat down on her - was that something was going on below her waist. It was only when she got home and stripped off her branded Adidas leggings that she realised what had happened. The logo of the sportswear company had been negatively branded onto her skin, with the burnt red area around the letters highlighting the pale skin of the German clothing firm. It was when I went to put on my bikini that I saw my leg, Danielle said. I thought aposOh my godapos. I was in fits of laughter.  Suspecting that the logo will fade from her leg by the morning, the Poole, Dorset woman was quick to capitalise on the unusual occurence. As well as collecting loads of shares when she posted it online, Danielle contacted Adidas askingthey would hire her as an on-brand model. Sadly the company turned down her request, complementing her on a nice tan before admitting it only took sponsorship bids from Australia and Germany. Danielle seems to have drawn a particularly unlucky card.    According to Bupa, leggings are typically a very good item of clothing to stave off sunburn. Long pants or leggings cover more skin than shorts, and a broad brim hat provides more protection than a baseball cap, the private health firm explained. It seems like Bupa hadnapost reckoned either with the recent ferocity of Britainaposs sun or with the thin material of the Adidas leggings.

A year after her final corgi Willow died of cancer - leaving corgi dachshund crosses Vulcan and Candy as her surviving furry companions - a fascinating insight into the lives of what must have been some of the worldaposs most pampered pooches has been laid bare. In her book All The Queenaposs Corgis, royal expert Penny Junor explains that the lucky dogs are given diets tailored to their specic nutritional requirements. What is for dinner even changes depending on their current residence, with rabbit and other game on the menu when theyaposre out on one of The Queenaposs estates.    Otherwise it is a iety of fresh, cooked meat, vegetables and rice, prepared specially for them in the royal kitchens, topped with a little biscuit, homeopathic and herbal remedies when required, and a special gravy that, legend has it, is the Queenaposs own recipe, Junor writes. Whenever possible, she feeds them herself and it is an afternoon ritual but not an unruly frantic free-for-all. A footman brings the food and bowls on a silver tray and lays out a plastic sheet to protect the carpet.    The Queen then sits them in a semi-circle around her and does the rest.

The -year-old, who is a frequent flyer, is due to fly to Alicante in Spain with her grandmother and boyfriend on August .    But she claims she was refused a free seat by Ryanair as her condition did not meet its disability policy - and instead was told she can only purchase the seat for £. Alicia, a travel consultant, said: It is disgraceful. I donapost know what gives Ryanair the authority to decide what a disability is and not. I was in shock at the ignorance. I told them that I could provide medical proof even though I would be having to disclose personal information, which I shouldnapost have to, but I was still told no. I have flown loads before with easyJet and British Airways and no questions have ever been asked.  Alicia said she first contacted Ryanair through its online service as a precaution, to request an aisle seat near a toilet, but was met with what she described as a aposscripted replyapos. Her grandmother, who has reduced mobility, was allocated a seat, as was Aliciaaposs boyfriend to act as her carer. Yet despite going into detail about her condition, Alicia was told she would have to pay for hers. On its website, Ryanairaposs policy states: Customers who have limited mobility in the cabin or who are using therapeutic oxygen, an Amsafe, Crelling harness or Meru chair will be allocated a suitable seat onboard free of charge along with one travel companion.    These customers will be boarded after general boarding is completed. The website also states that passengers travelling with guide assistance dogs, with limited or no mobility in the cabin, with an intellectual disability, blind vision impaired requiring assistance - will be provided support and an allocated seat. Aliciaaposs message to Ryanair read: My grandmother is already listed as limited mobility however my partner Matthew will be assisting her. However I require seat allocation near to a toilet as possible due to suffering with an autoimmune disease ulcerative colitis which affects the bowel. I will be bringing injections on board with storage supplied by myself and a medical letter for customs.    However a representative for Ryanair responded: We can only allocate passengers with reduced mobility. F is free for you, you can purchase it from the website. Following the reply Alicia and her boyfriend contacted a manager - but despite going into detail about her symptoms was met with the same reply. Alicia said: It made me feel absolutely awful and embarrassed. If I have a flare up, my immune system attacks itself and I can get sudden onset diarrhoea. My joints can become very achey, especially my coccyx and I get chronic fatigue which feels like I have been hit by the flu.

Asked  direct questions by Jeremy Corbyn, he failed to answer a single one. Instead he showed contempt for the Com­mons and the public by showboating when he should have been serious and blustering when he should have been straightforward. It is hardly surprising he is running from scrutiny when he has such a cavalier approach. He is recklessly driving us towards a no-deal Brexit without any care for the consequences. If we crash out it will put firms and farmers out of business, threaten medical supplies and force food bills to rise. Those who will suffer will not be the PM and his privileged friends but the towns and communities which can least afford it. What became clear yesterday is that Johnson is interested only in his own survival. His Brexit strategy has nothing to do with what is best for the country and everything to do with heading off Nigel Farage.  Hot and hotter Few on holiday will complain about yesterday’s record temperatures. The heatwave is also great news for our seaside resorts. But is less welcome for people stuck at work or having to travel on the badly disrupted rail network. We used to joke that the British summer started on the last day of July and ended on the first day of August. Not any more.  Scientists agree that the extreme weather is linked to climate change. The five hottest summers in Europe since  have been in the last  years. Unless we act, these weather patterns will be become more frequent and more intense.

But it turns out there are still a number of ways you might be leaving yourself vulnerable to burglars.This is according to Michael Fraser a security expert who knows only too well the way burglars think, as he used to be one. Appearing on This Morning on Wednesday, Fraser shared his top tips for protecting your house.   One of his most interesting pieces of advice involved a calendar, something not many of us would worry about. However he claims that yours could be putting you at serious risk, because burglars might be reading ititaposs within their line of vision.

As well as calendars, the expert also instructs people to use both locks on their front doorthey have two as burglars can tell when the dead lock isnapost engaged.  What I can do, he explained, aposIs put my foot up against the door andI push on it and it moves then a burglar could tell it isnapost engaged. Donapost have two locksyouaposre not going to use them. Fraser continued to say that aposbeware of the dogapos signs are pointless becausethe dog can move around in the house then so can a burglar. He added that people should install as much security to their home as possible - especially a doorbell with a camera. The problem is an opportunist always looks for a house where there is absolutely no security. The more you do to your house, the more likely they are to move on and go to another house, he said.

It will also keep business rates at a sensible level, at no loss to the council. This will benefit Reform Street and the city centre.”The application by West One, based in the city’s Blinshall Street, is the first by any party to bring the amusement arcade back into use.But the plan comes hot on the heels of a blip in confidence among business owners on Reform Street, who spoken of its “second album syndrome” following a resurgence in food outlets that began with Project Pizza in .The eatery, initially hailed as the shape of things to come, closed without warning last month and the unit is now advertised for let.Proprietors such as Akky Hayat – who runs German Doner Kebab and Fatburger – say punitive business rates are discouraging others from opening shops on the street.Mr Chadwick has not been discouraged. He added: “Footfall is rising and there are positive steps in the regeneration of the area.“The demise of Project Pizza is a minor setback to a street that is on the up.”However, it is hard to ignore the units once home to Victoria Wine, TSB and Swinton Insurance, which have remained conspicuously empty long after they have closed."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/5d077b2511d578.29027818-e1560779961602.jpg ","title":"a look back at some of dundee uniteds most famous foes including messi and gazza","story":"Dundee United’s final friendly of the summer comes on Saturday when preparations for the build-up to the Championship season are completed with a -mile trip south to face Shrewsbury Town.The game will be a valuable exercise for boss Robbie Neilson as he makes sure his players have had enough game time to be ready for the opener against Inverness on Saturday week.In terms of prestige, there’s no denying the English League One opposition fall into the “modest” category.There was a time, though, when the Tangerines were in the habit of hosting top opposition at this time of year.It led to some great occasions – and great victories – at Tannadice. Today the Tele looks back at some of those memorable days.DUNDEE UTD  SPURS Tuesday, August , Att: ,A Spurs side that boasted the likes of Argentine World Cup winners Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa, England’s Glenn Hoddle and the new strike partnership of Steve Archibald and Garth Crooks, were blown away by a United side that would reach the peak of its powers over the next few seasons.The Londoners started well and led through a Crooks goal as early as the th minute but, by the break, Billy Kirwood had levelled.After the interval, Jim McLean’s men stepped up a gear and goals from Graeme Payne, Derek Addison and Paul Sturrock gave them a handsome victory over a team that, within a year, would win a classic FA Cup Final against Manchester City.DUNDEE UTD  ASTON VILLA Sunday, August , Att: ,A year before that superb display against Spurs, United entertained Aston Villa, with striker Paul Sturrock once again to the fore.With United dominating from start to finish, “Luggy” bagged a hat-trick to send Ron Saunders’ outfit heading back south with their tails between their legs.If not too much was made about the victory, it was a sign the Tangerines were on the verge of big things and, within months, McLean’s team would secure the club’s first major honour in the shape of the League Cup.It’s also worth remembering, in just two years, Villa would be champions of England and, a year later, more than half the team that ran out at Tannadice would start their winning European Cup Final against Bayern Munich.DUNDEE UTD  EVERTON Tuesday, July , Att: ,.This game was a testimonial for long-serving Maurice Malpas, with his influential former coach Walter Smith bringing Everton to mark the occasion.If the English Premier League giants were already a sizeable draw, their signing of Paul Gascoigne, who would make his debut, brought extra attention that saw news as well as football media heading for Tannadice, although tragic events in Paris as a Concorde crashed, meant, ultimately, actual coverage of it was limited.As was often the case with Gazza, trouble was not far away. He had a first-half flare-up with Joachim Fernandez that saw the home trialist take such exception that boss Paul Sturrock took him off before he was sent off.Malpas’ big night was marked with a win, David Weir giving the visitors the lead before two goals in three second-half minutes from Steven Thompson and Alex Mathie turned things round.DUNDEE UNITED  BARCELONA Saturday, July , Att: ,For the second year running, the Catalan giants had used United’s St Andrews University training base for the first week of their pre-season build-up and that meant fans were treated to a second summer friendly in a row against them at Tannadice.A year earlier, minus Lionel Messi because he was still on holiday, Ronaldinho and Thierry Henry were the stars as a last-gasp goal by the French great gave them victory.With Messi starting, the  friendly saw the Spaniards really turn up as they blasted five past the Tangerines .For once, though, such a reversal was surely acceptable, such was the quality of the opposition and just the sight of one of the world’s greatest players in action meant everyone went home happy.

chase","story":"On-loan winger Jon Gallagher today insisted the Dons can make the group stages in the Europa League for the first time under boss Derek McInnes.And he insists there can be no excuses about heat or low crowdsthe Dons fail to do the job against Chikhura Sachkhere over two legs to keep that target alive.The Reds will take another step towards their goal when facing Chikhura in Tbilisi in the second qualying round first leg tonight.Secured from Atlanta United until January, Gallagher played a key role in setting up this clash in the Georgian capital.Gallagher produced a man of the match display on his competitive Dons’ debut in the - first qualying round first leg defeat of RoPS Rovaniemi at Pittodrie.The -year-old insists reaching the group stages was discussed as a target during pre-season and the Dons aim to deliver.He said: “Reaching the group stages is definitely the goal among the team and we said that in pre-season.“We feel like we have a good chance of doing that, but just have to be consistent and show up in both legs.”The logistics of tonight’s tie have thrown up challenges with the heat likely to be C and the game played in an almost empty stadium.Less than , are expected at tonight’s tie, played at the , capacity national stadium.There was also the six-hour flight into Georgia the day before the game.He said: “The heat shouldn’t be too bad.“I played in the southern part of America in Atlanta where there is hot weather, so I will be somewhat used to those temperatures.“Hopefully the temperature drops before the game.“The key to playing in heat is following the manager’s plan, being smart with your energy and trying not to burn off too much in that opening  minutes.“In Scotland the air is nice and open, but over here in Georgia it is a bit more clammy and you feel stuffed up.“You just have to pace yourself.“The stadium looks like a good set-up and hopefully the pitch is good so we can get the ball down and play.“We had a bit of trouble with that on the Astro surface in Finland last week.”Chikhura Sachkhere have had to play their tie at the national arena as their own , Central Stadium does not meet the requirements set down by UEFA to host a Euro tie.They have travelled  miles from their base, a journey that takes three hours.The Georgians are so desperate to boost crowd numbers they have made tonight’s game free entry to both supporters from both teams.“It will be something that we have to deal with,” he said.“Once you are on the pitch you don’t really notice stuff like the size of the crowd.“We will create our own atmosphere and intensity with the way we play tonight.”Chikhura Sachkhere manager Samson Pruidze has warned Aberdeen that he has pinpointed weaknesses in their play he aims to exploit to wreck the Dons’ European dreamWhen asked about this, Gallagher said: “The way we play we will put the target on their back regardless of who is favourite or not.“We always put the target on the opponent’s back and will do that again tonight.”Gallagher has swapped one Georgia for another.Now he will run out in the capital of the Eastern European nation that is close to the border with Asia.Versatile Gallagher, who has played in attack, midfield, the wing and right-back, travelled , miles from the States to sign on at the Dons.He has already exceeded those air miles with a trip to face Rovaniemi of Finland in the Arctic Circle before the ,-mile round trip to Tbilisi.“I have never played a team from this side of Europe before so it will be something fresh for me, for all of us,” he explained.“We will be prepared for what comes.“It was a long flight to get here, but that is part of the job.“We will not be making any excuses because it works both ways as they will have to come the same distance to us next week.“We are out in Georgia on the back of a good win in Finland last week and are trying to keep that momentum going.“There is a quiet confidence within the squad, although we know there is a job that has to be done.”It has been a remarkable  months ascent for Gallagher as at the turn of the year in  he was studying business at the University of Notre Dame.He represented Notre Dame, overseen by Dons legend Bobby Clark, in the NCAA tournament, and Clark coached Gallagher for four years.However, his fortunes turned when he was selected by Atlanta United as the th overall pick in the MLS SuperDraft.It was vindication and payback for the Dundalk-born player who had trials with Euro giants Juventus and Marseilles as well as Newcastle United and Blackburn.During his time in America, he trained alongside  Ballon d’Or winner Kaka at Orlando and World Cup winners David Villa and Andrea Pirlo at New York.He has a pedigree and hopes to fulfil that at Aberdeen.Gallagher got off to a flying start with an impressive debut in the first leg against RoPS.He said: “Hopefully the Aberdeen fans see that I give everything for the team.“I did not put too much pressure on myself for that debut.“When the game came and the whistle went I ran until I couldn’t run anymore.“That is the way I always play.“On that day things went well for myself and the team.“Hopefully it will be the same again in Georgia.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/4ab91e1a-c4b5-419f-819c-2c64a02438af-240x180.jpg

team have studied footage of the Dons’ - aggregate defeat of RoPS Rovaniemi in the previous round.He insists there are areas they can make the most in tonight’s Europa League second qualying round first leg.Pruidze called the Scottish press’ questions “provocative” when pushed on what weaknesses he had pinpointed as part of his blueprint.He said: “Aberdeen is a team with great history and tradition, so we are honoured to be playing such a team.“We saw both games Aberdeen played in the last round and have been reviewing each of their players.“They like to play an attacking type of football and the biggest danger to us is how athletic they are.“They are strong in midfield, Ferguson is a very good player and so is the centre forward Cosgrove.“The defenders on the flanks are also good at attacking high up the pitch and they are good when in possession of the ball.“Aberdeen play with wingers and like to deliver the ball into the penalty area.“They are a balanced team, but they have weaknesses and that is what we have to exploit.”The obvious question was then posed – exactly what weaknesses has he seen in Aberdeen’s play He said: “Yours was a very provocative question and we are not going to disclose this one.“We won’t disclose what we think they are because in the game we will have to capitalise on those weaknesses.“We will not tell you to your face, no way.“I can’t say we will win or draw this game because Aberdeen are the favourites and they have a lot of advantages over us.“But we feel we have enough to go into combat with them.”Pruidze heaped praise on Aberdeen and insisted they are favourites, but he is confident going into tonight’s tie.Chikhura Sachkhere have made the -mile journey from the agricultural village where they are based for the tie.Their own , capacity Central Stadium does not meet UEFA requirements to host a European tie.Chikhura Sachkhere have as a result made the near three-hour journey to Tbilisi.Their small fan base and the travelling involved will see the , capacity stadium near empty for tonight’s game.In an attempt to boost numbers, Chikhura Sachkhere have made tonight’s Euro tie free to attend for both clubs’ supporters.Around

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

Guard this Standard securely and bear yourself well that you may long retain the trust of your fellow townspeople.\"Standard Bearerrsquos Lass Caitlin Urquhart, was then called upon to invest Ronan with his sash and buss his colours.After cheers that raised the roof off the historical hall, Caitlin was presented with her Cleikum Brooch.Addressing the audience, the newly installed Standard Bearer said: \"It is a great honour for me to be chosen as Standard Bearer of my native town, which at this time celebrates the traditions associated with its history.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this area."},{"url":null,"title":"clive-storey-s-masquerade-takes-supreme-st-boswells-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers Show took place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.The

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":null,"title":"county-talent-fore-fringe-sea","story":"County residents are putting on a large number of shows and workshops over the  days.North Berwickrsquos own historian and author Ailsa Fortune, who will be presenting a talk on the Elgin Marbles, said: ldquoIt is encouraging that the Fringe by the Sea organisers include local performers and authors in their programme ndash itrsquos really good for the collective morale of this vibrant community.ldquoTherersquos always a great buzz about the place when the festival is in full swing.ldquoFor me personally, appearing at Fringe by the Sea is an opportunity to share my work on some of the little-known but intriguing East Lothian characters, like Mary Nisbet of Dirleton, whose lives have influenced our national history, and Irsquom hoping the connection with the Elgin Marbles, currently the subject of international debate, will stimulate lots of interest.Ailsarsquos book, Par for the Ladies, looks at the women who shaped the golfing legacy of North Berwick.

and Daniel McCabe, all , to speak to Prestonpans Community Council about their work and the potential involvement of much younger participants.The school was recently successful in achieving its UNICEF Rights Respecting School gold award, which means that it had proved that it incorporates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into the school through both teaching and actions.It now aims to take this further and bring this ethos into the surrounding community.The children were given the chance of addressing the meeting, which included ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell and Neil Gilbert, to ask questions and discuss the best ways to engage young people with what is going on in the community and to ensure their input is noted.The children asked about the plans for the site of the former Cockenzie Power Station and whether more activities for young people such as Rainbows and Scouts could be introduced to the areaWhen addressing the councillors and community councillors, Daniel, a house captain from St Gabrielrsquos, said: ldquoItrsquos important for us at this stage to know what our future is going to hold, and to try and make a dference when and where we can.ldquoTo be involved in the community council in some way would be fantastic, as it would give us comfort to know that the community is being taken care of, as well as what decisions were being made that might affect us.It was decided that the community council would send the agenda for each meeting to the school a few days before the meeting took place so that the children could see it and comment on any issues being raised.The community council said in a statement: ldquoWe would like to thank the four fantastic pupils from St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who attended the community council.ldquoIt was so refreshing to have such polite and knowledgeable young people along to one of our meetings to share their opinions and views on our agenda topics and ask the questions they feel most relevant to their lives.ldquoWe look forward to welcoming them along to future meetings and collaborating with them on the issues that affect all of us living in

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10149491.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

Hence the number of visitors from Japan and America in Linlithgow Palace, where she was born, or the Germans photographing forbidding Hermitage Castle in the Borders, where she paid a fleeting visit to the wounded Earl of Bothwell, a trip that cost her dear.Yet what is immediately obvious is how few locals there are clambering up Dumbarton Rock, where she stayed for months as a child, before being whisked to safety in France, or on the woodland paths around the site of the Battle of Carberry Hill, where her fate was effectively sealed.Arguably the most important location, Dundrennan Abbey in Dumfries  Galloway, had no other visitors whatsoever while I was there at the weekend.

All this while ndashone leaves aside the SNP for a moment ndash the polls have four UK parties closely grouped, none on more than  per cent of the vote.Jo Swinson and the LibDems ndash who did you think I was talking about  ndash have at least the advantage of a clear Brexit policy: to scupper it. Ms Swinson, like everyone advocating a second referendum, assumesthat it would offer an option to overturn the first result, and that that option would win.Still, the Liberal Democrats, like the Greens and the SNP, are internally united. Indeed, given that  per cent of the electorate voted Remain, itrsquos slightly mysterious that it took them so long to pick up those votes, though the European elections at last indicated a surge.They have only  Westminster MPs , a low place on the starting grid. Still, the Brexit Party, with similar poll numbers, will probably, as Ukip did, find it harder to translate support into seats than the LibDems, whorsquove always been doughty ndash many think dirty ndash election street-fighters. It seems quite likely, for example, that theyrsquoll pick up Brecon and Radnorshire next week.Another possibility is defections from other parties. The LibDems could double their parliamentary strength instantlythe non-aligned groups the Independentsand the Independent Group for Changefollowed Mr Umunnarsquos example ndash something as likely as not.There are, too, quite a few Labour MPs who believe Jeremy Corbyn neither deserves, nor is likely, to gain power, while Sir Ed Davey, who lost to Ms Swinson, hinted a couple of weeks ago that half a dozen Tory MPs dead set against ldquono deal might cross the floor to the LibDem benches. Cabinet resignations are mostly irrelevant, but defections are another matter.They would simultaneously Commons put us in General Election territory and Ms Swinson in a much stronger position. Itrsquos possible to imagine a situation, perhaps within weeks, where the LibDems might be not far behind the Nationalists in Commons numbers.While the LibDems wonrsquot take seats from the SNP over Brexit alone, therersquos no reason why they shouldnrsquot on other issues. If they pick up seats from Labour and the Tories in the rest of the UK ndash probably mainly in Remain areas, but also where the candidates are seen as hardline or unpopular for some other reason ndash itrsquos not at all dficult to imagine a scenario in which they exercise the balance of power and the ability to determine the nature of a future government.Itrsquos still hard to see them as the largest party, butMs Swinson plays a blinder and proves popular ,Mr Corbyn remains toxically unpopular,the Tories lose a lot of seats to the Brexit Party, and lots of Remainers vote tactically, even that may not be a total fantasy. Ms Swinson should probably be heartened by the vigour of Labour attacks on her time in office.Much depends not on the LibDems themselves, but on whether Boris Johnson can revive and hold together his party and deliver a Brexit Parliament can endorse, produce some plausible reason why not, or engineer some unforeseen electoral stroke of genius. None looks very likely, but that may be why the Tories endorsed him evenitrsquos a reckless   gamble he can do it, itrsquos pretty well certain no one  could.All the same, the LibDems have the same urgency when it comes to timing as the incoming Prime Minister. They need to muster their forces and strike before the end of October, becausethe UK leaves, the principal reason for anti-Brexit voters to back Ms Swinson vanishes. ldquoStop Brexit is not the same as ldquoLetrsquos apply to rejoin the EU.That will be the case even without a deal eventhe consequences are terrible, they are unlikely to be as apocalyptic as Remainers, for obvious reasons, now paint them. The political narrative and policy objectives will sht to adapting to the new circumstances.The imperative to get out in the next three months may be a sine qua non for saving the Toriesrsquo electoral bacon but therersquos an equal urgency for the LibDems to stop it by then, because itrsquos now not just their primary objective, but their chief raison drsquoecirctre. If the UK goes out, so does the main reason to vote LibDem."},{"url":null,"title":"oh-conservative-voters-done-uk","story":"The tradition began in earnest when one Margaret Hilda Thatcher rocked up to Downing Street on May , , quoting St Francis of Assisi: lsquoWhere there is discord, may we bring harmony. Where there is error, may we bring truth. Where there is doubt, may we bring faith. And where there is despair, may we bring hope.: Call an election nowI remember it well. Some people have their moon landing memories, others recall where they were on hearing of the the deaths of JFK Elvis Diana. I was watching the news in a friendrsquos house when Margaret Thatcher arrived in Downing Street. The summation by my friendrsquos mother, though it seemed bleak at the time, turned out to be blisteringly accurate: ldquoWersquore in the soup now.How true. Everything Mrs Thatcher promised to do, she did the opposite, trading harmony for discord and hope for despair. She left the UK ided, traumatised, and firmly set on a course that led directly to the EU referendum and where we are now.David Cameron was just as guilty of saying one thing on entering Downing Street and doing another. ldquoI want to make sure that my government always looks after the elderly, the frail the poorest in our country, said the PM who unleashed two decades of austerity.Theresa May dedicated herself to tackling injustice. A year later Grenfell Tower was ablaze  people, some of the poorest and most vulnerable in society, dead, right there in the capital city of the fth richest country on the planet.In short, whatever a Prime Minister says on the steps of Downing Street should be taken with enough salt to grit the roads during an entire Scottish winter.: No s or buts on Brexit deliverySo it was with Mr Johnson yesterday. Speaking in a voice that was part Pathe newsreel guy part crazed chipmunk, his aggressive, up and at lsquoem delivery was that of Donald Trump in his inauguration speech. Lots of promises and spending pledges, all of them issued in a scattergun way. It was ashe was speaking to his party conference rather than a sceptical country. As for his praise for the Union, his ldquoawesome foursome phrase, straight from the campaign trail, is already sounding tired.The only surprising moment was when he pledged to take personal responsibility for delivering Brexit by October . It should not have needed saying, of course he is responsible, but that he needed to say it spoke to the doubts that even he, drunk on the fizz of his powerful new job, knows is out there. Those ldquodoubters, doomsters and gloomsters he referred to are on his side of the political ide as much as the other.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Boris Johnson becomes PM: How the day in Westminster unfolded\",\"description\": \"Boris Johnson becomes PM: How the day in Westminster unfolded\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs GCrxDl-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests GCrxDl.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": : Spree of resignationsIf this was the famous Johnsonian light he had been hiding under a bushel it was hardly dazzling. But never fear, say his supporters, it will all work out in the end. This, according to the Johnson faithful, is how his premiership will play out. Essentially it is his stint as London mayor Leave campaign chief revisited. He plays the role of charismatic central figure. Around him will be packed ious Rasputins, clever chaps, perhaps even a few chapesses, who will come up with the ideas and, courtesy of their cult-like zeal, will work night and day to get them through, by any means necessary. Except bus slogans, that would be far too provocative, even for them. But expect a major marketing blitz and some wizard wheezes.Next comes the assembling of a Cabinet of all the talents. Every PM claims to have one at the start. The make up of Johnsonrsquos is meant to say, ldquoLook folks, despite what you may have read and heard, I donrsquot have racist or sexist bones in my body. Irsquom a pretty cool kind of dude with room for all, even Remainers.In reality his ministerial ranks will be full of people only too easy to dump when the going gets rough, as it surely will. Being mayor is not in the same universe as being PM, the Olympics are not Brexit. This job will require Mr Johnson to master detail as never before, to maintain his calm under pressure, and PMQs will be the least of it.Theresa Mayrsquos last PMQs yesterday was a hot and bothered affair at times, the high temperatures outside reflected in the crimson sweaty faces of MPs inside the chamber. Normally such occasions are remembered for the goodwill on display, the setting aside of political dferences in common support for democracy. But with the ious digs at her successor, and her attack on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn ndash perhaps it was time for him to accept his time is up, she suggested generously ndash the May premiership ended as it had been conducted, largely in rancour, and stained with tears .

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aberdeenshire West MSPAlexander Burnett says the A project ishuge for the North-east and the decision that is eventually taken on the route will have major implications for the local area\"  Transport Secretary Michael Matheson invited to hear residents A dualling concerns viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"forget neil and buzz meet scotland s coosmonaut buzzbo","story":"Fty years ago tonight, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the surface of the moon .But that’s old news – Scotland has its very own space hero to celebrate!

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything. Something as simple as helping open a window or popping to the shops to pick up some sunscreen can make a huge dference to someone’s comfort and well-being.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. So far Prospect has continued to ask for a pay increase far in excess of what we are able to afford and that unfortunately remains the situation.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute. Our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five year period remains on the table and will continue to explore potential solutions within our affordability.”“The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our passengers, communities and the airlines operating from our airports.

Shetland football matches for the Milne Cup dating back to Jockie Wood£ . tax incl.One Hundred Glorious Games is the title chosen to describe the milestone just reached in the annual football fixture between teams representing Orkney and Shetland. But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

One of the things I’d like to see is a strong deal with our European partners and a free trade agreement.”Mr Jack said while a no-deal Brexit was not his “preferred option”, it should be kept “on the table” during negotiations with the EU right up until the deadline of  October.“If we have to leave without a deal,I feel we have prepared for that, then we will leave without a deal,” he said. “That will be a Cabinet decision and that’s what we’ve all signed up to.”Mr Jack, who is the MP for Dumfries and Galloway, also said the UK Government would “absolutely not” agree to a second Scottish independence referendum. His view on the issue could prove important, as in order for the Scottish Government to hold a legally binding vote, the necessary powers must be transferred from Westminster.In a letter to Mr Johnson yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon said she looked forward to “taking this matter forward” with him after Holyrood s from its summer recess in September.The SNP’s Scotland Office spokesman Tommy Sheppard said Mr Jack’s comments proved he was “completely out of touch and even more detached from the people of Scotland than his predecessor”. Mr Mundell, who was sacked by Mr Johnson after pointedly refusing to back him at any stage of the Tory leadership contest, described Mr Jack as a “Brexiteer”.He said he had been forced out as the new Prime Minister wanted to “mould a Cabinet in his own shape”, promoting those who would be willing to back a no-deal Brexit.“He certainly didn’t feel I was maybe as on board with a no-deal Brexit as he would want me to be ... I’ve always been clear that a no-deal Brexit isn’t a good outcome,” he said.Mr Mundell refused to sayhe would vote to block a no-deal Brexitthe matter came before MPs in the House.He said: “I am very clear I don’t think no-deal is a good outcome, but on the other hand I am very, very clear we have to leave the EU. We have to deliver on the electoral mandate from the referendum. If not, I think we face a severe dislocation to our political system.”Mr Mundell described a no-deal Brexit as “a dficult outcome”, but stated: “We have to get to each scenario as it comes along.“One of the things that has happened in dealing with Brexit is people have made statements and declarations way ahead of the issues emerging. At this moment the focus is on trying to get a deal.”Mr Mundell continued: “I think we have been too guilty of setting out firm and fixed positions ahead of events unfolding and emerging.”The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have told Mr Johnson that it would be “unconscionable” for the UK to leave the European Union without a Brexit deal.Ms Sturgeon had on Wednesday demanded an urgent meeting with the new Prime Minister, warning that preparations for a second Scottish independence referendum would continue.“Given your public comments about leaving the EU on  October with or without a deal, ‘come what may’ and ‘do or die’, it is now – more than ever – essential that in Scotland we have an alternative option,” she said.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

They will ask the Shetland Islands Council to declare a climate emergency, as Orkney Islands Council did earlier this year. raquoWhat an amazing turnout, thanks to everyone who participated. 👏🏻🙌🏻As long as people in power put the value of money ahead of anything then we will never cease to destroying the planet until mother nature herself decides for us. For the le of the planet no amount of money can compare to what mother nature gives us.Earth#s nemesis is our banking systems and what they represent.As the Bibles says Timothy ,  # For the Love of Money is the root of all kinds of evil #.I#d very much like to read the rest of Johan Adamson#s comment but can#t find it here.Involving children in the spread of propaganda mirrors the ways of Chairman Mao and his #cultural revolution#. It is an increasing trend in UK and one we should surely reject.So, instead we should indoctrinate them in the ways of continued, pointless consumerism that is managing to waste resources and destroy the environment  Why is this behaviour any more #normal#  These are intelligent young people who know their own minds, ones who can be bothered to get up and make their voices heard.I didn#t advocate consumerism though. Children should not be pushed into anything, including consumption.The reason the older generation are skeptical, they#ve seen it all before.You#ve been reading the Mail again, Ali!For goodness sake, Brian, learn some basic simple science and stop the socialist dogma. Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.IFLAS is a global hub of inquiry, teaching, and dialogue on enabling the transition to more fair and sustainable societies.All that is pure Mikey Mouse to a true Scientist!!!Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green . For women it is only .%. As for shades of green —- no chance for men !Maybe that’s one of the reasons why some of themcan’t resist verbal battles.Green for GO and they can’t stop . 🔴Thanks to Brian for those interesting links. The second, albeit straight from a professor in the field, might also not pass Ian’s test, but both seem to provide plenty of evidence it is more than reasonable for the kids to be concerned.  If we can agree this as a reliable source it might then be possible to make more progress on whether the kids actually are right, and or have a right, to be concerned.The clue to where their bias lies is in the name #statutory Committee for Climate Change# not climate science or climate research but climate#change#Nigel Farage will save the world.I have never claimed the children have no right to feel concerned, just that school strikes are a pointless, stupid action endorsed but fools and the politically motivated, that is my opinion no more no less.Relax kids! Theres no proof of climate crisis worldwide, says self-proclaimed “true Scientist” Ian Tinkler, yet our national climate scientic advisors think there is. Who is right  Hint, Ian hasn’t shared where he gets his reliable info.The government listens to an armsindependent body of expects established by law because it knows there is a problem. Ali, however, spies a plot con. Some of Ali’s previous alien-culture ideas have been shown to be a little further to the right than those most Tories admit to, so we can but guess where he gets them from.John and Ian have both recently had a pretty extreme go at climate protestor Greta Thunberg. They, with Ian, are strongly pro-Brexit. There is a possible common connection  cause. The far-right internationally have begun to target Greta whilst denying the dangers of global warming. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read thearticle “Germany’s AfD turns on Greta Thunberg as it embraces climate change denial” from June th.The AfD is a extremist far-right racist party which democrats should oppose. The article ends by warning that far-right extremists are using troll armies to stir up hatred, distrust and anger.Oh and the vile culture that I object to is busy protesting outside Anderton School in Birmingham like you they are using children to push their agenda, while you hold the shield of “islamaphobia” over them to protect their bigotry from critique.I see the French far right nutters National Rally are boycotting Greta Thunberg now. It#s striking that right-wing extremists shake in their shoes when intelligent women come on the scene.I have no idea whatanything the french lot have said but I#m willing to bet they attacked the message and the adults manipulating the child, not the child being used to spread it.I see the French far-right nutters National Rally are boycotting Greta Thunberg, O my goodness, Greta is being #boycotted! Extraordinary behaviour!! Brian Smith, how can that be  What and how can you boycott ateenager  I had two of them and boycotting them! not credible, now exploiting! ask Greta,s Dad about that. Loads of Greeny points for the cult of heating doom.Whoop, whoop. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read the . Peter Hamilton, you are priceless. Keep it up please your fountains of wisdom are priceless.Although he has disparagesthree times above, Ian references their articles when it suits, albeit selectively. For example, on July th above, he excitedly reported:“The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option#”However, had he dwelt on the full article,he would have realised the actual scientists involved perceive there is an urgent problem, that their solution is partial, that it can only really help - years down the line, and that other urgent actions are required. His position is quite far from theirs.Just in case Ian misses the point, the selective misuse of other scientist’s work isn’t what real scientists do. So “a sensible, intelligent and educated option”, for Ian, might involve a refresher course to help him avoid misassumptions and  claims. That would be a “more rational course of action” than attempting to maintain his current pretensions that nothing incan be trusted and that his unsubstantiated understanding of climate science can.Further to the above, I have never #had a pretty extreme go at climate protestor Greta Thunberg.# I merely pointed out her unfortunate mental illnesses intermated that she was, perhaps mentally exploited by her dysal family and the Greens ofEurope. No wonder she suffers from #selective mutism#, that is when her ultra-green father speaks on her behalf. To claim my motive is allied to Germany’s AfD, a neo-nazi movement is a lie and slander, no more no less, so typical of your tawdry comments.Further to the above, another little porky from Peter. Peter Hamilton claims above that,# hiscurrent pretensions that nothing incan be trusted#!! What manest nonsense, it is self-evident that is a lie. Peter highlights my comments where I quote articles from theto further my views ! It is only the arty, green and ignorant socialist prejudiced types that I disparage. They are not limited to thewe have some specials on Shetland. I sure Peter knows to whom I refer. Why is the far right intent on undermining climate concern  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greta Thunberg’s widely reported conversation helps to shine light on the answers.Undermining collaboration between liberal democracies, whilst simultaneously weakening trust in mainstream political solutions and structures, is of course helpful to these extremists, however this can be achieved.But there is also big money at stake in continuing our current trajectory in general, and reliance on fossil fuels in particular. Ocasio-Cortez helpfully points out that ExxonMobil had internal science that “definitively pointed out that climate change was real” in the s and back then were predicting weather changes as far ahead as . She also states the fossil fuel lobby, and particularly the Koch brothers, have “essentially purchased the entire Republican Party”. I find it to be an informative and inspiring article which should be of particular use to anyone questioning whether Greta Thunberg should have a voice in the debate. To see Ian Tinkler and John Tulloch attack her barely days apart, and in such similar terms, is troubling indeed. Be they witting or unwitting tools of a broader extremist agenda, I hope they can reflect and desist.A more thorough appreciation of how Gove formed this view with regard to the information and advice provided by Professor Ian Boyd, Defra’s Chief Scientic Adviser, and his team can be found at:Both the U.K. and the Scottish Parliaments have declared there is a climate crisis, but Ian surely knows better..."},{"url":null,"title":"amaryllis takes top prize at shetland race first leg reception ","story":"The prizes for the Bergen to Lerwick leg of the Pantaenius Shetland Race were handed out at a civic reception at Mareel on Friday evening..

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1985871.jpg--.jpg?1563356127000\n","title":"council to honour ww2 veterans with silver poppy gift","story":"WHILE urging Mid  East Antrim Council to honour the last surviving veterans of World War , DUP councillor John Carson reflected on the cost of that global conflict to one local family.Proposing a motion that each surviving veteran in the area - from across the services and the merchant navy - should receive a silver Poppy of Remembrance in November, Alderman Carson said it was also fitting to remember those who had made the supreme sacrice especially with the th anniversary of the outbreak of war looming.

After an introduction to the abattoir, the group was given a comprehensive tour of the kill floor and lairage.In the chill area, the group members had the opportunity to see dferent grades of lambs coming through the plant that day. Gary outlined what the ideal lamb is for Linden Foods to allow them to process for their customers’ needs, with discussion on how farmers can market lambs that meet this specication. The group was joined by William Chesneywho explained the grading system and what the grader is looking for when assessing each carcase as the lambs were weighed and graded at the scale, prior to entering the chill.William and Gary both reinforced the importance of weighing and handling lambs regularly to assess their market readiness. In particular, they emphasised the importance of not allowing lambs to becoming overfat. This not only restricts the potential market outlets, but is uneconomical for the farmer.The farmers were guided through the slaughter area where each stage of the slaughter process was explained. The visit finished with a walk through live lamb reception area where Gary was able to demonstrate the type of live lambs that produce the carcases Linden require for their customers. There was good discussion on the use of electronic identicationand especially feedback to the members on inidual lambs. Members stressed that, where they had invested in electronic readers and on farm software packages using EID to become more efficient, they were not receiving enough feedback information from the abattoir. Gary agreed that more information on inidual animals would be of benefit to the farmers. Linden Foods have invested in the hardware and software to allow inidual animal feedback to farmers linked to tag numbers and are keen to develop put this service in place for suppliers.The group members were impressed by the skill or the operators on the slaughter and processing lines and the efficiency of the overall processing system. The high level of animal welfare standards demonstrated was impressive in such a busy but efficient working environment. Concluding the discussion, Senan White thanked Keith, Gary and Linden Foods for hosting the group.

Following its refurbishment, the church has become a hive of community activity and will welcome former Clannad musician Moya Brennan for a highly anticipated concert on August .The County Donegal performer has just released a new album, Timeless, and will play a number of shows throughout the country in the coming months, but luckily she was able to be booked for the Greater New Lodge Community Festival through a mutual interest with Abundant Grace Pastor Sharon Perry.“I serve on the board of a Christian charity with Moya Brennan and I happened to ask hershe would be available,” Sharon explained.“She wasn’t free the night we were supposed to be having it, so we change the date and she was very willing to come along.“It’s a great opportunity for the local community to see such a well-known performer. I think it’s something that doesn’t come along often so close to home. You might see an advert for one of the concert halls in Belfast for Moya, but to have it on our own doorstep here is brilliant. Moya is a lovely lady with a beautul ministry of music.”As well as providing a fantastic night of entertainment, all proceeds from the concert will go to to Special Olympics Ireland.“We ourselves as a charity try to make ends meet to get the work done that is in our hearts to do,” Sharon stated.“We try to help other charities where we can, so we thought this was an opportunity to help kids with learning disabilities. There are lots of activities there for them to be stimulated through sport.”Looking forward to the gig, Sharon said: “We have Zephaniah Dancers coming as well, who are an Irish dance group based in Portadown. They’ll be the support act. The strange thing is that they’re really excited about coming as well because they have actually choreographed a dance to one of Moya’s songs and had got permission to perform it in dferent places. The fact that the girls are now coming together with Moya is amazing.“There will be a mixture of secular music, Gaelic songs and a few Christian songs in the mix as well.”She continued: “I hope people take the opportunity because the chance doesn’t come along often to see Moya Brennan for £. We know that people will come from where, and we welcome that as well, but we would really love the local community to come along and at £ most people can manage that. We are also making some tickets free of charge through the local family support hubs for families for whom a fiver is a challenge.”Moya Brennan will play at Abundant Grace, - Duncairn Gardens, on Wednesday, August , at pm.For info tickets:t:   e: info@abundantgrace.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"north reacts to new pm boris","story":"POLITICAL representatives have been giving their reaction after Boris Johnston was elected new Prime Minister.After a long-running Conservative leadership contest, Boris Johnson saw off rival Jeremy Hunt and will officially take over from Theresa May today .Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O’Neill says her party will continue to stand up for the Irish interests in the face of Johnson’s “reckless Brexit agenda”.“Sinn Féin will work to protect our peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including the commitment to calling a referendum on Irish unity,” he said.“The British government has responsibilities and commitments under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and we will hold them to account. “We will continue to stand up for Irish interests, for the majority of citizens in the north who voted on a cross-community basis to remain within the EU. “We will continue to work with the Dublin government and the EU to protect Ireland from the catastrophic impact of the reckless Brexit being pursued by Boris Johnson and the hard Brexiteers.”DUP Leader Arlene Foster congratulated Mr Johnson on his election.“I have spoken with Boris Johnson and congratulated him on becoming leader of the Conservative Party,” she said.“We discussed our shared objectives of strengthening every part of the union, ensuring the  referendum result is implemented and seeing devolution restored in Northern Ireland.“The Confidence and Supply Agreement between the Conservative Party and the Democratic Unionist Party remains.That Agreement included a review between each Parliamentary session.This will take place over the coming weeks and will explore the policy priorities of both parties for the next Parliamentary session.“I also look forward to welcoming Mr Johnson back to Northern Ireland shortly after he becomes Prime Minister.”Alliance Leader Naomi Long said the UK needs a “statesman, not a showman”.“Everyone will have their own opinion on Boris Johnson and his career to date,” she said.However, it is now vital as he takes up the reins as Prime Minister he demonstrates a level of leadership and seriousness which has been lacking to date. At such a critical juncture, we need someone who is detail focused and sensitive to the complexity of the challenges ahead. In short, we need a statesman, not a showman.“Boris Johnson’s road to the Conservative Party leadership has been paved with destructive half-truths, bluster and outright lies, many of which helped precipitate the crisis from which he is now personally benefiting. With an impending no-deal Brexit and the stark choices facing us, we need substantive answers from him to what are incredibly serious and complex questions.“To date he has failed to demonstrate any real understanding of the needs of Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of Brexit and especially in a no deal scenario # needs that require more than merely a can-do attitude to resolve.“The Irish border is a delicate and nuanced issue, with resonance far beyond trading arrangements and with the potential to unpick the fabric of the Good Friday Agreementmishandled. It is also impacting on the ability of parties to restore the political institutions here. He now needs to demonstrate his ability to act with sensitivity and impartiality in his engagements with local parties.“It#s time to cut the bluff, bluster and bombastic rhetoric and start to provide the kind of reassurance business and civic society needs. Whilst I remain sceptical he will do that, I wish him well and will be more than happy to be proved wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reaching new musical heights at the earagail arts","story":"THE Earagail Arts Festival runs every July and brings a wealth of talent to Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way.The festival has been running this year from July  and will wrap up its calendar of events for another year on Sunday, July . With Belfast’s love affair with Donegal well established, what was once a well-kept secret among the country’s festival-goers is now well and truly on the radar for Belfast music and arts lovers and this year they have been spoiled for choice.At the weekend the festival moved to Arranmore Island for what was billed as the Mór Music # Arts Trail – two days of music, comedy and the spoken word.Crossing over on the Blue Ferry from Burtonport at lunchtime on Saturday passengers were already getting in the mood for the weekend ahead. It was only later that we realised some of them were the artists whowould grace the stage later in the day.Proceedings soon got under way amid the intimate surroundings of Neily’s pub. This is one of the attractions of the Earagail Arts Festival: organisers bring together some of the most talented musicians and artists from around the country and put them before an audience in an accessible setting. Saturday afternoon did not disappoint, with the talented Oscar Jennings – just turned  that day – who, with a mature acoustic set, belied his tender years. The young singer-songwriter had Neily’s in the palm of his hand. Look out for his distinct voice in the years ahead.Conor Mason – also from Derry – and Leila Jane followed, and again their acts were faultless. Switching from guitar to keyboard, Mason’s voice is melodic and haunting, his love songs touching the soul. Singer-songwriter, -year-old Leila Jane from Donegal, once more exemplied the depth of talent in the Irish music scene with hints of Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline hovering above her blues six string.The night was but a pup and we moved on to Early’s pub. Ahead of us –we could stick the pace – was Eve Belle, Delta Fuse and Accidents in the Workplace. A self-proclaimed “singer of sad bops” Eve Belle took us on a journey through the consequences of le. A woman of immense song-writing talent, she’s another one to check out. The evening was brought to a crescendo withblues rock four-piece Delta Fuse from Derry – boy, there’s some talent in Derry these days – and funkmeisters Accidents in the Workplace from Dundalk.After lunch it all began again on the Sunday with more music, this time at The Crossroads. We arrived just as the highly-rated Josie Duncan was wrapping up. However, we would catch-up with the Scots Gaelic singer back in Early’s later. Also playing at The Crossroads was Thatcher of the Acropolis with their unique blend of electronic rock and Gaelic poetry. After a trad session in Phil Ban’s – which coincided with Shane Lowry’s Open win on the big screen – the island was really rocking now, and it was soon back down to Early’s for the final evening. When Dublin poet Stephen James Smith announced from the stage that he would be reading poetry for the next  minutes, there was some uneasy shuffling in the seats, but we needn’t have worried, he had us laughing and crying in equal measure with his poems and stories. Incidentally, Stephen is playing in the Black Box in Belfast on October . Make sure you go along. I’ll be back.Following Stephen we were treated to the haunting Gaelic sounds of Diane Cannon and Manus Lunny, followed by Clann Mhic Ruairi. Another rousing ending to another Arranmore evening was brought courtesy of the impressive Honeyfeet.You can check out the final weekend of entertainment at the Earagail Arts Festival at eaf.ieWe stayed on Arranmore island at Early’s Bed # Breakfast where you will get a great welcome from Jerry and his we Pat.We travelled to Arranmore Island on the Blue Ferry – https:arranmorefastferry tickets "},{"url":null,"title":"class sizes in northern ireland more like developing world","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Learn more about the Poussey Washington Fund here: https:t.co cyvuEuUB pic Xnesys— Orange Is the New...July , “It’s just a TV show, at the end of the day, but it’s changing people’s minds and hopefully with this fund it will be changing people’s lives – getting them the education that they need, getting them the health care and the mental health care that they might need,” she said.Orange Is The New Black is loosely based on a memoir by Piper Kerman, a Smith College graduate from a patrician family who served  months in a Connecticut federal correctional institution on drug-related charges.The show, created and written by Jenji Kohan, became a showcase for actresses of colour and brought issues around race, sexuality and criminal justice to the fore.“The legacy of the show, I hope, is empathy. That, and a normalising of ersity, which reflects real le,” said Kohan. “The world is not one colour or one socio-economic class or one gender. I think what we’ve come to appreciate most in our work are these crossroads where people who don’t necessarily encounter one another are forced to. Great drama ensues. And comedy. And humanity.”Tara Herrmann, an executive producer and writer on the show, said the idea for the fund came from people over the years asking how they could give back.“It’s really a call to action to our fans,” Herrmann said. “There are people out there who feel like, “Now what  What can we do  You’ve given us the story, we see it, we want to make a dference.’ So hopefully this is a place to go.”After reading Kerman’s book, Herrmann said she and Kohan were immediately attracted to the world behind bars that few people explore and the way humour and love could exist in such a cruel system.“These were women who were surviving in a world that is doing everything to keep them down. And the way they’re surviving is the tribes that they’re creating and the support system they’re setting up,” Herrmann said.As for the finale, Herrmann said she hopes fans will like the way the season ends and wishes the characters linger in viewers’ minds like one of her other favourite shows, Mad Men.“We hope that we’ve created the final season to live on,” she said. “Every once and a while I think, ‘I wonder what Peggy’s up to. We hope that people do that with Orange too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derrys new holiday inn express officially opens doors","story":"Derry’s newest hotel officially opened its doors for business yesterday and in the process brought with it over  jobs.The Holiday Inn Express on the city’s Strand Road represents a £ million investment in the city and the chain’s owners, Intercontinental Hotels Group , have said its presence will not just enhance employment but will create business opportunities for service providers across the region as well as in Derry city centre.With  bedroom’s the new hotel is now the second largest in the city and as well as having all the state-of-the-art facilities associated with modern hotels its central location is within walking distance of all the city’s main tourist attractions, bars and restaurants.General Manager Stephen Redden said that he is confident the new hotel will add to the vibrancy of the Strand Road and act as a compliment to existing and emerging businesses.“We are delighted to open the doors and add a fresh dimension to the city’s accommodation.

online at the end of last week showing a group of men and women involved in a brawl outside Balliniska Heights.It is the latest in a string of similar incidents at the housing development which has built itself a reputation as an anti-social hotspot since welcoming its first tenants in April of .Sarah Doherty has been there since the beginning and she said there has been lawless behaviour throughout that time.She lives in one of the houses in Balliniska Avenue but the criminal elements are confined to the apartment block named Balliniska Heights. Sarah is afraid to let her child out to play in the park as a result.“Since I’ve been there I’ve noticed non-stop partying, people taking drugs, someone was stabbed in the head, a person died over-dosing, a couple fighting outside, a paedophile overlooking the park had to be removed too.“People off their heads on drugs crashed into my car recently too when my wain was with me. He was arrested.“And the fight last Thursday was the latest.”She added: “You can see them drinking and taking drugs during the day so you know something bad is going to happen.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshA court case is also ongoing after a man allegedly raped and attempted to kill a woman in Balliniska Heights.

I don’t think they’re doing enough,\" Sarah said, \"realistically there should be strikes, but people with knives etc should be removed straight away.“How can you feel safe as a single mother with all this going on.”She added: “When I was looking for a house I had to be interviewed, so I don’t know how these people got in with criminal records.“Even today I seen the police here arresting people, it’s just constant now.“But they’re not going to force me out because I like living here.”Police responseResponding to the latest incident and addressing residents’, a PSNI spokesperson said that on Thursday, th July, police received a report of an altercation and anti-social behaviour in the Baliniska Heights area of Derry.On arrival of police there was no sign of this altercation.

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon. Karen Patterson will provide a fluent French translation for European visitors.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face. He is the most lovable, happy and determined boy.It was during Matthewrsquos recovery in hospital that Louise learnt about Swim Labrsquos water-based physio technique from another mum.She first took him to a programme in Lanzarote in March but has since took him to Swim Lab programme in Fivemiletown last month. He will be ing in September and December.Louise added: ldquoWe have exercises and activities to do with him every day which I video and send to the instructors to view and they then set other exercises so the work continues between the sessions.ldquoMatthew is doing things like riding a pony which he enjoys, but he doesnrsquot realise that this is helping strengthen his core muscles while he is doing it.The next local fundraising event is a charity golf day and barbeque at Bright Castle Golf Club on Saturday, August .To donate please visit www.gofundme f matthews-wish-to-walk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down Rally has surprise winner  ","story":"REIGNING World Rally Esports champion Jon Armstrong secured victory at a sensational Carryduff Forklt Down Rally, which was round four of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Stage Rally Championship.Armstrong and co-driver Noel OrsquoSullivan mirrored some of his success in the virtual gaming world by taking victory aboard a McGeehan Motorsport prepared Mini WRC at the event which was jointly organised by Ballynahinch and District Motor Club as well as Rathfriland Motor Club.It was his first time driving a World Rally car competitively and after using the opening miles to settle Armstrong quickly became a major contender.He was fourth overall after the tricky opening stage before climbing to third after setting the fastest time through stage two.He was gradually building his pace and looked set to challenge for the lead during the second loop of stages when he got a puncture during the fourth stage. The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals.

installed Brexiteers in key Cabinet posts as he moved swtly to carry out a brutal cull of Theresa May#s senior ministers.Within hours of Mr Johnson entering No , more than half of Mrs May’s top team had quit or been sacked as the new Prime Minister ruthlessly wielded the axe.In a final dramatic move on Wednesday, arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg – the leader of the European Research Group which proved such a thorn in the side of Mrs May – entered the government as Leader of the Commons.Earlier, Dominic Raab, who quit the Cabinet over Mrs May’s Brexit deal, ed as Foreign Secretary and First Secretary of State, making him Mr Johnson’s de facto deputy..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default

ardent Brexiteer and Thatcherite who has previously advocated theof capital punishment, was made Home Secretary.And Michael Gove – who spearheaded the Vote Leave campaign in the  referendum with Mr Johnson but then scuppered his subsequent leadership bid – became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the Cabinet Office.Entering No  for the first time after his audience with the Queen, Mr Johnson was watched by girlfriend Carrie Symonds as he promised to give the country “the leadership it deserves” while vowing to meet the October  deadline for leaving the EU.On a day of high drama at Westminster, Mr Johnson’s defeated leadership rival Jeremy Hunt was the most high profile casualty after he refused to accept a demotion from the Foreign Office.Sajid Javid, the home secretary who also ran against Mr Johnson, was given the key post of Chancellor, meaning the holders of the three great offices of state apart from PM are the children of immigrants.But the reshuffle was marked by theto the Cabinet of Brexiteers Andrea Leadsom at Business and Theresa Villiers at Environment, and promotion for Liz Truss at international trade.Stephen Barclay, another prominent Brexiteer, retains the key post of Brexit Secretary.The appointments were to some extent offset by promotions for former Remainers such as Rob Buckland, who becomes Justice Secretary, while Nicky Morgan s to the Cabinet as Culture Secretary.Ben Wallace, another former Remainer who nevertheless ran Mr Johnson’s previous leadership bid, was made Defence Secretary.Sam McBride: Behind the smiles, the DUP is uneasy about what Boris Johnson may do Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"However the danger for Mr Johnson is that he will now face a raft of disgruntled former minsters, who could make le extremely dficult for him in the Commons.The new Prime Minister entered No  with a slender majority for the Tories and their DUP allies of just two, which could come down to onethe Conservatives lose the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election next week.Among the first to be sacked were Penny Mordaunt and Liam Fox, both prominent backers of Mr Hunt, who lost their jobs despite their record as committed Brexiteers. try catch  TrendingThe th Open Championship - Day two at Royal PortrushMan killed at

Pic Lorcan Mullally, IIEAUnionist parties of all shades will take comfort from Mr Johnson’s tough talk on scrapping the Brexit backstop, which they feared would undermine the Union.DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has worked closely with Mr Smith through their parties’ mutual confidence and supply agreement, to ensure government business has been approved by the House of Commons..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “But there have also been many occasions when we have been on opposite sides of the argument as well,” said Sir Jeffrey. “I have found Julian a very professional politician, a very good communicator but also someone who is his own man and will come to his own conclusions issue by issue.”...he has the skills and abilities to help us restore the AssemblySir Jeffrey Donaldson MPHe confirmed that his party wants to see changes to the backstop within the proposed Brexit deal.“We are very clear that our strong preference is for the UK to leave at the end of October with a deal that works for the UK as a whole including Northern Ireland,” he said. “And that means addressing not only our concerns but concerns right across the Commons about the backstop.”He believes that Brussels and Dublin will renegotiate the backstop even though they are “still playing hard ball”. Butthey don’t, he poses them the question: “Do you really want a no-deal outcome here ” A time-limited backstop is one option the DUP would consider, he said.He noted the government itself formally abstained on votes to liberalise NI laws on abortion and same-sex marriage, even though MPs, including Mr Smith, voted the amendments through. Askedthat puts him at odds with core DUP policies, Mr Donaldson replied: “Julian Smith is his own man. He will treat all of the parties fairly and impartially. But at the end of the day he has the skills and abilities to help us restore the Assembly.”\"  \"  Institutional victims left ‘devastated’ again, says woman campaigner who was abused in orphanage Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"But UUP leader Robin Swann said Mr Smith must waste no time in ending the “indulgence” of Sinn Fein and the DUP to see power-sharing restored.He said: “I urge Julian Smith not to let the DUP-Conservative confidence and supply agreement to influence his decision making and neither should he allow Sinn Fein to hold democracy to ransom by allowing their self-imposed boycott of the institutions to cause further damage to local services. He needs to engage with all Northern Ireland’s main political parties as a matter of urgency.”Sinn Fein’s chief negotiator Conor Murphy said a change in secretary of state will end in failureit is not accompanied by a change in government policy.“Unfortunately, Julian Smith doesn’t exactly inspire confidence given that his only interest in the north to date seems to have been to attend the DUP conference,” he said.“Successive British administrations have refused to honour agreements or to resolve the issues of the past while imposing austerity and Brexit against the wishes and best interests of the people.”SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon said Mr Smith cannot be a “yes man” for a single party.“We note the enthusiasm with which Julian Smith was welcomed by the DUP at Westminster today and the relationship he has undoubtedly formed with them given his previous role as chief whip,” she said. “That poses an immediate challenge to the new secretary of state to demonstrate that he is not beholden to one party as efforts to restore inclusive power-sharing government continue.”Kirsty McManus, national director of the Institute of Directors NI, said: “Given our unique circumstances in Northern Ireland in terms of our vulnerability to the impact of a no-deal Brexit, we will seek an early meeting with Julian as we work to convey the concerns of local business leaders on this and other key issues.”Mr Smith was elected MP for Skipton  Ripon in . Since joining Parliament, he has focused on rural issues, education, business and international development.He joined the government whip’s office in  and was appointed chief whip in . Before politics, he set up his own international head-hunting firm in . He grew up in Scotland and attended a comprehensive before receiving a bursary to a Somerset sixth form school, later reading History and English at the University of Birmingham.try catch  TrendingThe th Open Championship -

So can the Secretary of State explain what he has done to offset the lost opportunity for Welsh steel producers of the lost Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon and the electrication to Swansea \"What projects has he actually secured to provide procurement opportunities for Welsh steel producers  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
