The most expensive collection of 5,800 pogs we saw went for £215 earlier this yearIn light of the new game, we took a look on eBay to see how much original pogs were selling for. There are hundreds of listing for pogs worldwide, both limited edition pogs and general collections of them.The most valuable UK sale we found was for a collection of more than 5,800 pogs in a variety of different themes, including a Star Wars collection, which sold for £215 in March this year.          Job-lot collections of pogs are selling on eBay for an average of £20 for around 200 discsNext was a set of the special edition ‘Chupa Caps – City People Series’ in green which went for £122, then a similar set of \u0027Chupa Caps\u0027 in glow in the dark for £90.88. Several people had also sold job lots of random pogs, with one of 4,009 discs for £80.The average price of those we found were between  £20 and £50 for collections of at least a few hundred pogs, or those which contained some special edition designs. Even some unfinished sets were being sold, with one part set of the \u0027Batman Power Caps\u0027 series selling for £21 in April this year.Inidual pogs and slammers, were also selling on eBay but these are a lot less and going for an average of £1 - £2.           The new Pog game will let users scan in images of their retro pogs for in-game creditsTherefore if you do have a collection left over from the 90s, you could try your hand at selling them online. The new game is being created by the London-based firm Compton Technology which has just launched an Indigogo campaign to raise funds to design the game. The target is $50,000 and it’s reached $5,947 already with 106 backers and a month to go.The free game, named POGS AR, is due to be released in September for android and iPhone users and it’s the first officially licensed mobile game from the World Pog Federation, the biggest seller of pogs in the UK.It will include all the original features of the 90s game – including flipping and slamming – but through a mobile app.          A limited edition physical pog is available for people who back the campaign earlyUsers will be able to scan existing pogs and unlock extra content, earn physical prizes, take part in slamming matches with other players and compete in regular tournaments. For those backing the funding campaign, there will be extra perks available including a limited-edition physical slammer, special in-game content, a custom designed pog character and early access to the game.Sam Park, director of Compton Technology, said: ‘Pogs blend two things people love to do - compete and collect. \u0027But in pogs you play for keeps and must risk losing some of your collection to expand it, so the excitement and intensity increases as you play.          This collection of almost 500 pogs sold on eBay for £31 earlier this year‘By going digital and applying modern technology like AR to the original concept, we’re creating a game community and collectible ecosystem that I believe can be even bigger than the original.’  As the new game is due to launch in September,  the number of people flogging their old pogs online could increase over the next couple of months and therefore the overall value you can sell them for will go down as more people hunt theirs out to sell on. But conversely, as interest grows there may be more buyers, which could also affect the price. On the other hand, if you want to get involved with playing the new game – it could be worth hanging onto the pogs as the designers say you will be able to scan them in and use them with it.One year fixed rate£20 in M\u0026S points after first purchaseDouble points for a year£150 to switch, £50 to stay"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/15/4CF3EC4F00000578-5818559-image-a-24_1528466664114.jpg","title":"Dennis Rodmans relationship Kim Jong revealed","story":"    Former NBA player Dennis Rodman has been close friends with Kim Jong-un since early 2013Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong-un’s relationshipRodman’s friendship with the North Korean leader is believed to date back to 2013 when the former NBA player traveled to North Korea with Vice Media reporter Ryan Duffy to host a series of exhibition basketball games in February 2013.Rodman met with Kim and declared him to be his ‘friend for life’ and an ‘awesome guy’ after they bonded while in the country.He later stated in an interview with Good Morning Britain: ‘I hang out with him all the time. We laugh, we sing karaoke, we do a lot of cool things together like skiing and riding horses.’He also said in an interview with Sports Illustrated that he wanted to ‘break the ice’ between the United States and North Korea.The former NBA player has thus far made five trips to North Korea, the most recent of which was in June 2017 in which he insisted he was ‘trying to accomplish something that we both need\u0027.Rodman’s bond with Kim is so close that he will reportedly be at the upcoming June 12 summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, though the White House recently rebuked the notion that the retired NBA player should play a role in the high-level diplomatic talks between the United States and North Korea.

The drum major is poised to parade in his final Trooping the Colour on a day which will also mark the end of his four-decade career in the British Army (pictured outside the Officers Mess in Munster, 1986)Drum Major Staite also leads one of the massed bands during the parade in slow and quick time - something the father-of-two agreed very few people get to do.\u0027A lot of people tell you it is great to march behind a band, but you can\u0027t beat marching in front of it,\u0027 he said.During his career Drum Major Staite said he has visited 40 of the 50 states in America, and has worked in Kenya, Northern Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq.It was during a posting to West Berlin on his first deployment that he also patrolled the Berlin Wall and guarded Adolf Hitler\u0027s deputy, Rudolf Hess, when he was held at Spandau prison.Quizzed on what that experience was like, Drum Major Staite who plans on retiring to Middlesbrough with his wife Fee, said: \u0027You just sat in a sanger at Spandau prison.\u0027You weren\u0027t really allowed to look into the yard, it was just a normal prison with one person in it. But driving around the Berlin wall in those days was something very, very different.\u0027Posted to Household Division headquarters in 2000, he was involved in the funeral of the Queen Mother and Lady Margaret Thatcher, the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games and the royal weddings of Prince Charles and Prince William.June 9 will mark 38 years 355 days in uniform for Drum Major Staite, who described his impending last Trooping the Colour as a \u0027very special moment\u0027.He has also chosen the march the Grenadier Guards will step on to Horse Guards to, which is Wadi Al Batin - a battle honour from the 1991 Gulf War - in which he fought.\u0027Marching on to parade with the band playing Wadi al Batin for me, which is the march I chose, that will be quite emotional,\u0027 he added.Once the parade is finished Drum Major Staite said his state clothing will have to be handed back, something he said he will probably do \u0027with a tear in my eye\u0027.   Turban-wearing Coldstream Guards soldier will make history at Trooping the Colour as the first soldier to parade in Sikh headdress A Coldstream Guards soldier who will wear a turban as he parades during Trooping the Colour has said he hopes it is looked upon as a \u0027new change in history\u0027.More than 1,000 soldiers will take part in the ceremony which marks the Queen\u0027s official birthday on Saturday as the nation honours the monarch.For Guardsman Charanpreet Singh Lall the event is not only his first Trooping the Colour, but also marks the first time a member of the Coldstream Guards has taken part wearing a turban.The 22-year-old from Leicester told the said: \u0027I hope that people watching, that they will just acknowledge it and that they will look at it as a new change in history.\u0027I hope that more people like me, not just Sikhs but from other religions and different backgrounds, that they will be encouraged to join the Army.\u0027A member of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards, the turban he will be wearing during Trooping the Colour will be black, featuring the ceremonial cap star to match the bearskin hats.Sikh Coldstream Guard becomes the FIRST soldier to wear a...Prince Harry\u0027s stepbrother and stepsister revealed after...Former head of British forces Field Marshal Guthrie, 79, is...It\u0027s hardly Royal Ascot!

Since leaving the Army in 2015, the Prince has focused his work on the creation of the Invictus Games and Heads Together, a campaign which seeks to challenge the stigma of mental health problems.A Kensington Palace source said: ‘Harry follows these issues closely and is always keen to get information from a variety of sources.’Welcoming the Prince’s intervention, CSgt Coult, a father of one from Suffolk, promised to launch a fact-finding mission on his behalf.‘I’m delighted that Prince Harry has shown an interest at such a critical time,’ he said. ‘The number of deaths among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans this year is utterly shocking and an indictment of the failure of the Government and military charities to meet their needs.          Died at the age of 35: Christopher Butcher, with wife Laura, was diagnosed with PTSD and died last yearThe MoD doesn’t want to know how many Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are killing themselves, that’s why it doesn’t collate the information itself.’The spate of suspected suicides began with Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt, 39, of the Royal Engineers, who was found hanged on January 2. His death inspired our campaign which led to the MoD setting up the Helpline For Heroes in February.It has since received hundreds of calls from troops suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other mental health issues. Before our campaign, officials argued such a helpline would attract 50 calls a year at most.Welcoming Harry’s involvement, Nathan’s father Derek Hunt said: ‘He knows what it is like emotionally to serve on the front line. He cares. It is a shocking reflection of the Government that there have been so many suicides among young veterans this year.’Harry served with WO Hunt in Afghanistan in early 2008 as part of a desert reconnaissance unit. Following his death, the Prince expressed his heartfelt condolences to his family. The son of former England football captain Terry Butcher, Army captain Christopher Butcher, served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was found dead aged 35 at his parents’ home last October following a battle with PTSD.          TRAGEDY OF IRAQ VET: Ex-Royal Marine Dave Evans, who served in Iraq, is suspected to have committed suicide this yearThe suspected suicides of frontline veterans this year also include an elite Special Boat Service (SBS) trooper found hanged in his room at the unit’s base in Poole, Dorset, last month, and Dave Evans, a former Marine who served in Iraq.British military operations in Iraq began in March 2003 and concluded in May 2011. During those 2,974 days, 138 soldiers were killed in hostile action. Following the 911 attacks in 2001, UK operations in Afghanistan started in October 2001. British troops marked the end of operations by handing over Camp Bastion on October 27, 2014. By then, there had been 405 deaths in hostile action over 4,775 days.The MoD said: ‘Any suicide is a tragedy. Help is available for serving personnel and veterans through the 24-hour mental health helplines and we are spending more than £20 million a year on mental health services.’  We must ALL do more to help themComment by Lord Dannatt I am not surprised Prince Harry has expressed concern about this very serious issue. Anyone who has taken part in frontline operations, as the Prince has done, would feel the same way about an increase in suicides in the veteran community.I would also commend Colour Sergeant Trevor Coult, a soldier decorated for his gallantry in Iraq, for bringing this matter to the Prince’s attention.As with the death of Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt earlier this year, any suicide, particularly that of a relatively young veteran, is one too many.There are helplines for veterans and serving personnel now, the latter following a successful campaign by The Mail on Sunday.I would appeal to the families and friends of veterans who are struggling to encourage them to seek help or to inform service charities or their GPs themselves.Don’t leave it until it is too late. Everyone close to someone in danger has a role to play.Everyone realises there is a problem but nobody is complacent. The ongoing challenge is to ensure that those who need help actually get it.We must all do more – the Government, the NHS and the military charities."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/08/4D19C0D400000578-5825717-image-a-24_1528615019459.jpg","title":"David Walliams puts 5 35M north London home market 2M paid it","story":"David Walliams has placed his north London house on the market for £2million more than her paid for it 13 years ago          The master bedroom has integrated wardrobes as well as am open-plan en-suite with a freestanding bath and plenty of open spaceThe real Lost Voice Guy: How son of a cancer nurse Lee...Share this articleThe expansive pad was where he lived with ex-wife and model Lara Stone and before that it was owned by Oasis superstar Noel Gallagher.It was dubbed Supernova heights in the nineties because of the extravagant parties its former owner threw.The house boasts a stylish living area, an extensive garden, a roof terrace and private parking.

Recent storms have shifted sands to reveal the 17th century cannons and anchors off the coast of CornwallTheir accounts of the final voyage of the ship is known in remarkable detail because a pamphlet was published a few months after the wrecking.The title of the pamphlet is \u0027A full ACCOUNT Of the late Ship-wreck of the Ship called The PRESIDENT: Which was cast away in Montz-Bay in Cornwal On the 4th of February last, As it was deliver\u0027d to HIS MAJESTY, (both in Writing and Discourse) By William Smith and John Harshfield, the only Persons that escaped in the said Wreck\u0027.The tale goes that as the President set off for home the crew were involved in a deadly battle with pirates off the Malabar Coast of India.Six pirate ships set upon the merchant ship, but the battle was won when a shot from one of the President\u0027s cannons penetrated a pirate powder magazine, sinking the ship.          The East India Company ship President met her end in February 1684, and only two crew members remained alive to tell the taleBut that victory was followed by misery and defeat, as weather prohibited the crew from landing to restock provisions.For 11 weeks they went without food and water, and in the end resorted to eating the ship\u0027s dog - which was described as \u0027a delicate banquet\u0027.With the crew in a weakened state they were unable to work the ship, and the President was swept into a storm just off the Cornish Coast, in Mount\u0027s Bay.The ship sank with \u0027very rich lading, modestly judged of no less than a hundred thousand pounds * with much treasure of pearl, and diamonds\u0027.

According to witness statements, after being woken by smoke alarms, a resident called the fire brigade just before 1am.Four fire engines arrived at the scene minutes later and as the crew dealt with the fire in the fridge freezer, flames began to grow in other areas of the kitchen and images revealed that it had spread to the cladding before the firefighters had even arrived.As the fire continued to spread, by 2am the London Fire Bridge had declared it a ‘major incident’ and at this point, around 40 fire engines were at the location or on their way. In addition to this, because of Grenfell Tower’s ‘stay put’ fire policy, many residents were told to remain in their flats by emergency services.The ‘stay put’ order was abandoned at just before 3am and 65 people were rescued from the building by firefighters, 144 managing to escape before the order was abandoned, but only 36 after. By 4:30am, the entire building was engulfed and the fire did not stop until 1am the next day.          Photo issued by the Grenfell Tower Inquiry of the kitchen in Flat 16 where the fire startedGrenfell Tower vigilWriting for the Evening Standard, Prime Minister Theresa May has revealed that she will ‘always regret’ not meeting the residents of Grenfell Tower after the disaster and made it clear the belief she ‘didn’t care’ was ‘never the case’.She continued: ‘What I did not do on that first visit was meet the residents and survivors who had escaped the blaze. But the residents of Grenfell Tower needed to know that those in power recognised and understood their despair.‘And I will always regret that by not meeting them that day, it seemed as though I didn’t care.’ The Grenfell Tower inquiry has been halted for a week so that memorials and vigils can take place to mark the anniversary.The North Kensington community will come together for a 24-hour vigil on the eve of the anniversary and at 1:30am BST on Thursday, June 14, the names of all the fire’s victims will be read out at St Clement’s church.At 12pm, survivors and the bereaved will also gather near Grenfell Tower for a minute’s silence, the tower being lit green alongside 12 other tower blocks in the area, from 12:54am, the time the fire is thought to have started and will be for the following four evenings.

The manufacturer said it would also be investing in its plant at Halewood, Merseyside, to build the next generation Range Rover Evoque.In the short-term, more work than anticipated will move to JLR’s new £1bn facility in Nitra, Slovakia, which is due to open at the end of the year. JLR, owned by the Indian company Tata, had already signalled it would move a large amount of the production on the Discovery, which sold about 45,000 units last year, the lowest volume of the five models built in Solihull. In a statement, JLR said: “This significant investment and technology upgrade in Solihull in order to accommodate our next-generation of flagship Land Rover models, and the refit of our Halewood plant for the next Evoque, is proof that we remain committed both to the UK and to transformation and growth.“The decision to move the Land Rover Discovery to Slovakia and the potential losses of some agency employed staff in the UK is a tough one but forms part of our long-term manufacturing strategy as we transform our business globally.”JLR said the move was unconnected to the Brexit headwinds that led to it announcing 1,000 UK jobs would go in April. Its profits have also been dented by the slump in diesel sales.The company has said it would make an electric option for each of its new models after 2020. David Bailey, the professor of industrial strategy at Aston University, said: “There has been speculation locally that they needed to free up space to make electric vehicles. There was concern that their first electric car, the I-Pace, was being made in Austria – people wanted that built here. “If this move on the Discovery means producing electric cars here, overall that is a good thing. We want to see that transition to a low-carbon economy in the Midlands and we want to see the jobs here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5df59eddc13ba0a154141df35759fe4c1d443c9/436_460_4083_2451/master/4083.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89d83ddf6f453b07497cf12fa182762f","title":"ryanairs uk cabin crew to be represented by union for first time unite","story":"Unite signs recognition agreement with airline that could cover about 650 staffCabin crew at Ryanair in the UK will be represented by a union for the first time after Unite signed a recognition agreement with the airline.Around 650 staff working from Ryanair’s UK bases could be covered by the agreement, with the union able to represent them in talks on pay, hours and holidays.The news follows similar deals with two Italian cabin crew unions, struck five days ago, when the airline said it hoped to sign more recognition agreements in the coming weeks. The rights for crew come after months of talks following Ryanair’s shock announcement in late 2017 that it would recognise unions – a move prompted by a shortage of pilots causing a wave of cancellations. It has struck deals with pilots unions around Europe, including Balpa in the UK, but securing similar agreements for crew has taken longer. For now, many crew remain indirectly employed via agencies such as Crewlink and will not come under the remit of the Unite deal.Working conditions at the airline have come under some scrutiny, with aspiring crew having to pay thousands of pounds to train to work for Ryanair, as well as facing sanctions for not hitting sales targets on board. Unite, which represents more than 25,000 cabin crew across airlines operating from the UK, said it had secured full consultation rights and collective bargaining for Ryanair’s employees, from whom three union representatives will be drawn, with paid time off for union duties. The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, said it was a “historic agreement and a significant step by Ryanair” and urged all crew to join the union. He said: “For the first time ever Ryanair’s UK cabin crew will have a recognised union in their corner to deal with workplace issues and collectively bargain on pay.“I’d urge all UK-based Ryanair cabin crew to join Unite and be part of one the biggest trade unions in the world representing airline workers.”McCluskey said the union would be pursuing similar agreements with the agencies that indirectly employ the rest of Ryanair’s UK cabin crew. He added: “Unite looks forward to building a positive relationship with Ryanair that benefits passengers and workers alike.”The International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) welcomed the union recognition but warned that it did not mean Ryanair’s working practices had yet been reformed. Stephen Cotton, the general secretary of the ITF, said: “We welcome this historic first step from Ryanair to talk to Unite the union on behalf of all UK workers. However, there is a still long way to go to resolve all the issues that their workforce have raised with our affiliates across the Ryanair network.” Ryanair was approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef29e68000139f7e9cafc9bc8e0a532e75f40cef/1445_0_7809_4689/master/7809.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc3f06b7bb67ae641a666a6a278e754c","title":"copenhagenize case urban cycling graphs","story":"Danish-Canadian urban designer Mikael Colville-Andersen busts some common myths and shows how the bicycle has the potential to transform cities around the world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eab4fc423fd0a0b6d03b2a98149edadc6305e86b/0_87_3671_2202/master/3671.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d67c31012c239e4bc08382e847e0816","title":"theresa may brussels brexit","story":"A lot of confusion arises from the way “Brexit” has come to describe two very different things. It can be heroic liberation from foreign control – a common British definition. Or it can be the task of dismantling the UK’s membership of the European Union, in which heroism plays no part. That is how it is generally understood abroad.They sound the same and are spelt the same way, but the meanings have erged so far that really they should be separate words. One is an event, the other is a process. One is booked for 29 March 2019 the other will drag on for a decade or more. One is a fantasy, the other is a negotiation. Fantasies tend to be non-negotiable.On Tuesday, the Commons starts voting on amendments to the EU withdrawal bill and the debate will be passionate, invoking democracy and patriotism. “Brexit” will mostly be used in its fantastical sense. But some rebellious Tories and many Labour MPs will deploy the B-word according to international usage, speaking the language of negotiable agreement. (That is also what Theresa May will have to do at a Brussels summit at the end of June.)To understand the difference, it helps to identify the moment when the two meanings parted company. It was 8 December 2017. May presented the “joint report” that closed the first phase of separation talks. To seal the deal, the prime minister promised the EU an invisible border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. She also promised Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, that there would be no new differences in the arrangements covering Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. The only way to satisfy both pledges at once is for the UK to retain near-total regulatory alignment with the EU for the foreseeable future. There may have been some ambiguity lurking in the tortured official syntax but, in essence, May signed off on a soft Brexit. That was six months ago. The ink is dry.If Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson believed half of what they have said about ditching the talks, threatening to go it alone on “WTO rules”, they would have rejected the joint report and demanded May’s head. They didn’t, and so their bluff was called. You do sometimes still hear chat about “no deal”, but only from people who would see setting fire to their own heads as a viable alternative to the hairdresser.Yet the Tories did not accept the consequences of their actions in December. They still think it should be possible to ditch EU regulations without disrupting trade. They want UK enterprises to be part of a single European commercial space, competing with EU businesses, but with a right to selectively apply EU law. No jurisdiction in the world would offer that privilege. Brussels said as much. But off went the cabinet, hunting for magical ways to restore a border without border controls (“customs partnership”), or to reintroduce border controls without a border (“maximum facilitation”).None of this made sense outside the UK. In\u0026nbspdomestic debate, the word “Brexit” was still being used nebulously and dishonestly, as it had been by the leave\u0026nbspcampaign. In Brussels its definition was refined by the joint report: it meant sticking to the deal. The\u0026nbspTories have wasted 2018 so far arguing about deals with\u0026nbspa Europe of their imaginations, as opposed to dealing with the one that exists in law. The parameters of available agreement are known. May could withdraw mainland Britain from the customs union and single market – economically potty, but technically possible – while submitting Northern Ireland to joint jurisdiction with the EU. She would challenge the DUP to suck it up because if they brought the government down they might wake up to find Jeremy Corbyn (whom they dread as an agent of Irish reunification) in Downing Street.Or, she could sign the whole of the UK up to a customs union and single market membership. That\u0026nbspwould entail submission to European court rulings, payment into EU budgets and free movement of people. It would be just like EU membership but worse, because there would be no top-table seat to defend national interests. If she plays her diplomatic cards very well, the prime minister might upgrade that package to include a consultative role when big decisions are being made, plus a modest dispensation on free movement. Skirting\u0026nbspthe boundary between realism and fantasy is a proposal to stay in the single market for goods only – allowing a more independent trade policy in services. Ambitious maybe not impossible.Those are the runways on which the Brexit plane can land. It is circling in the air because May doesn’t want to tell the passengers about the destination. Wisely, she rejected advice from her backbenchers to ditch the plane in the sea or slam it into a cliff. The point of departure now feels very remote. Even if she wanted to go back, it isn’t clear whether there is enough goodwill in the EU tank to get us there. Time is the fuel and she is running low.And May is alone in the cockpit. No one else wants to make the announcement: fasten your safety belts, we are starting our descent. The days when Brexit meant gazing out of the window at wispy cloud castles are over. Corbyn doesn’t want to say it. Johnson can’t say it. They don’t want to tell the public that the options are either: a deal worse than membership or no deal, which is worse than the worst deal.There is orderly arrival in a second-rate location, or there is a fiery crash-landing. That is what it means to honour the referendum. That is what it meant all along. There is no sunnier destination just over the horizon. But there is also no political leader with the courage to admit it. Instead we have our prime minister, afraid of the runway, without a clue how to turn the plane around, flying on empty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d345a5d0955e876e81cdfff9e7f1e1c87845915f/0_6_2854_1713/master/2854.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdfda08c47aa221f89dc9e80fb74b66c","title":"trans child be himself understand community","story":"Media discussions about transgender people have taken on a personal significance for me. My son was my daughter until last year, when, after years of hints here and there, and months of him being uncharacteristically tearful and reclusive, he told us he was a boy.My instinct was caution, determined to shield him from wounding words and quizzical looks and the need to navigate out of this if he was wrong. I said, “Let’s not tell anyone at school just yet. You’re only 12. I promise I believe that you believe you’re a boy right now, but what if you tell your friends and then realise you’ve made a mistake?”I worried about boyfriends, girlfriends, online bullying and long memories. My happy child, always off exploring with hordes of kids, might be left behind, too weird to be in the gang. He was quiet, but determined, questioned how long he had to wait. I said until half-term – a few weeks away –and if you still feel the same then, I’ll talk to school about you wearing the boys’ uniform.What I didn’t know then is that people don’t just change their minds about this. I’ve researched and researched and found nothing but evidence confirming that once a person, young or old, comes out, explains their gender isn’t all it seems, that’s that. It isn’t a mistake, a cry for help, or a mental illness – it’s a fact. And the time it most commonly comes to light is when puberty arrives. It’s all so obvious now – it wasn’t then – but the time physical difference becomes apparent is the time the distress of gender dysphoria becomes acute.A week later, a call from school – my son, so upset he couldn’t speak, had gone to a trusted teacher. He couldn’t bear to be thought of as a girl for one more minute. He was a boy, he wanted to dress as a boy, he didn’t want a red pen cross on his Spanish homework when he’d used the masculine to describe himself. We met with his open-minded, compassionate teachers. I was still urging caution – nothing public, not yet, please, just a little more thinking time. What about peers’ reactions? We mustn’t rush. He explained, through tears, that he would rather people bullied him about being a boy than have to carry on pretending he was a girl.And the penny dropped.My son, in his distress, helped me realise that there is something even worse than being abused in the street, and that’s being told by strangers you’re not who you know you are, that the truth of you is not acceptable so if you want to be safe – be normal, please. Being thought of as funny-looking, a weak man or a manly, ugly woman, the titanic social pressure to look your gender, physical discomfort, even pain, are a small price to pay. A baggy jumper in summer heat, chest binders, hormone blockers, side-effects, surgery being more likely to attempt suicide, be homeless, be the victim of violent crime, murder, sexual assault. Certain countries wholly out of bounds, a crime to be you, violence inevitable, media debates that aren’t kind, that make your mother flinch and rush to switch the radio off, change the subject, protect you. Having to be tolerant of intolerance, taking deep breaths and bracing yourself, standing tall – they don’t know how fast your heart is beating, how much your palms are sweating.If you could avoid all that and happily pretend you’re a girl when you know you’re a boy – why wouldn’t you? “Mum, if I could, I probably would, but I can’t because it isn’t who I am.” And there’s the rub – it’s not a choice, it’s a truth. And it can be wonderful.School arranged PE with the other boys, “he” not “she” – and the boys’ uniform, he left the house wearing that and the broadest of smiles. He changed his name – just one letter, but a clear mark of boyhood, a farewell to girlhood. He joined the LGBTQ+ group at school – as did every single one of his magnificent friends. I called his friends’ parents and explained we were proud of him, this wasn’t a dark secret to be discussed in hushed tones. Beautiful reactions from one and all. We are lucky, I know. One offered a friend whose son was transgender and did I want to be put in touch, others asked what they could read to learn more another, unprompted, gave our school WhatsApp group a gender-neutral title, and a mum of a trans child told me about Gendered Intelligence, a life-saving organisation with a trans youth club. I’ve never seen a child look so delighted as my son on his first visit.There will of course be struggles aplenty ahead – even the strong, proud trans role models my son has face a daily struggle. Just being themselves is an act of political controversy. And my son worries for his trans peers. He told me about a friend whose parents don’t accept his gender, that it would be such a relief for him to have a kind place to go, that didn’t cost money, where everyone was nice to him even if he’s wearing boys’ clothes.Then I heard about efforts to create such a place – the LGBTQ+ community centre volunteers are crowdfunding and working hard to set up an open, accessible space for LGBTQ+ people in London. What a door opened for us when we found them. They don’t even have a building, but the community they’ve created already has been transformative: advice about our legal rights, solidarity at moments of struggle, hugs, picnics, real understanding from people who’ve been riding this wave for years. My son spent bank holiday Monday in a park, chatting to an open and generous person who was able to answer all his questions from personal experience. We’re part of a community now – it’s uplifting and gives me hope for a more compassionate future, one where we aren’t the subject of a vitriolic debate.• Molly Mulready is a lawyer and mother of three"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff8a4c7d9d250ff0080e3447ea172ebbf1132d39/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f66618b8b3c56a315df623722e6edd70","title":"how we made spare rib magazine","story":"‘WH Smith wouldn’t stock some issues. One cover showed a woman in the throes of an orgasm’There were lots of things rumbling around in 1971. Germaine Greer’s The Female Eunuch had come out, and there were protests against Miss World – but they didn’t seem to reach the ordinary woman. I had dropped out of university and was working on an underground newspaper called Frendz. It was an “alternative” culture, but for women it was extremely sexist. If you didn’t agree to get laid, you were a “straight”.We – Marsha Rowe and I – wanted to make a feminist magazine that would be widely read. She was going out with the son of journalist Claud Cockburn, and we were all at a Chinese restaurant one evening when Claud picked up a spare rib and said: “Call it Spare Rib.” It was a moment of genius.There were terrific arguments at the launch party. The gay rights people were shouting that we weren’t supporting them, the radical feminists were shouting that we weren’t radical enough. You’re always going to displease someone. We wrote an editorial saying liberation was as important for men as it was for women – we were adamant that feminism was going to be brilliant for both sexes. Inevitably, that fell away. I wish we’d been able to explore it more.We seriously thought we were going to take on Woman and Woman’s Own. We’d do parties to raise money and wouldn’t let people out until they’d given us £20. At one point we were so desperate, we asked an Arab sheikh for money. He was extremely nonplussed. I don’t think anyone had ever asked him for a donation without offering some kind of sexual favour.Certain branches of WH Smith wouldn’t stock some issues. One cover had a woman supposedly in the throes of an orgasm with the line: “The liberated orgasm … Make a New Year resolution to have one.” It went over very badly. The magazine was also a difficult advertising proposition. The first issue had a makeup ad in which a woman was very demurely pulling aside a lace curtain to reveal half her face. After that, we realised, well, actually, we can’t run those kind of ads.I left in 1974, but Spare Rib kept publishing until 1993. It was there through the crucial years of feminism. It pushed what needed to be put in front of people – and it didn’t give up. In 2013, the journalist Charlotte Raven asked if she could relaunch the magazine, but in the end we said no. It played a part in changing the landscape for women in Britain, but things have their time. You resurrect them at your peril.I did what was expected of me in the early 1960s in Australia and became a secretary. I’d seen the alternative magazine Oz and thought: “This is fabulous.” So I got a job there and saw how it was put together. At the end of the decade, I moved to London. At a meeting of women who worked in the underground press, we realised that we did all the support work, and then we went home and looked after men there as well. That revelation – actually speaking it – was extraordinary. I suggested Spare Rib at the third of these meetings. I remember Rosie’s expression, those big blue eyes looking all smiley and positive. Six months later, in June 1972, our first edition was on the stands, on sale for 17 and a half pence. We had a feature on romantic novels and a brilliant piece by Patricia Hewitt on women’s pensions. I’d met someone who knew George Best, so we interviewed him for the man’s page, which was partly a satire on the usual women’s page, but also because we wanted to explore what men thought about feminism.We called ourselves an alternative women’s news magazine. I adored magazines and their visual aspect, but we could only afford two colours, to go with black and white. I wanted Spare Rib to have all the traditional elements of a women’s magazine, but with a different spin. Our first fashion spread was a double page on jeans. No one in fashion ever mentioned jeans back then.The women’s liberation movement changed my life, but I discovered my voice through Spare Rib. We did a feature on the first women’s centre in London and the first refuge. At that point, domestic abuse was rarely talked about. It was something women were blamed for. As soon as news spread of what we were trying to do, people wanted to contribute. Those early days in the office were a joy, working with women, sharing ideas, thinking things through. It was so non-competitive. It took about four years for Spare Rib to find its feet. By the time 10 years had gone by, it had become more of a magazine for the women’s movement. I think it lost a certain spark. We’d had a wonderful DIY page and a cooking section – and all these things had disappeared. The design element lost some of the early brilliance, too. It became much more solid.Financially, it was tough going. In later years, they had to rely increasingly on grants, and the readership shrank. But the fact that it lasted 21 years is a tribute to the series of brilliant women who worked there. • Spare Rib features in Print!

It is based on international tests sat by 15-year-olds in participating countries.The report says the current “decentralised” system of matching teachers to vacancies in the UK could be a factor behind the disparity between qualified teachers in advantaged and disadvantaged schools.School leaders who took part in a survey for the study said the lack of qualified teachers was a major barrier to overcoming disadvantage and improving learning.“Most countries and economies compensated disadvantaged schools with smaller classes andor lower studentteacher ratios,” the report said. “However, in more than a third of countries and economies, teachers in the most disadvantaged schools were less qualified or less experienced than those in the most advantaged schools.”Gaps in pupil performance between those from wealthier and poorer backgrounds were wider in countries where disadvantaged schools employed fewer qualified and experienced teachers than so-called advantaged schools."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/498d9f144135338896cc0fc01300d07ef08ec4dd/0_154_4209_2526/master/4209.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcac03477b51ecc0f750d72fa4f338fa","title":"benjamin massing claudio caniggia foul world cup italia 90","story":"In an extract from his book World In Motion, Simon Hart talks to the late Benjamin Massing, whose flying full-frontal felling of Argentina’s Claudio Caniggia was merely the first of many shocks at Italia 90The 1990 World Cup began with a bang and no one felt it more than Claudio Caniggia. If Argentina 0-1 Cameroon was the most seismic opening result of any World Cup, there is arguably no more famous a foul in finals history than the one Benjamin Massing, the west African nation’s huge central defender, effected on Caniggia, the long-haired Argentina forward, with two minutes remaining of the tournament’s curtain-raiser at San Siro on 8 June 1990. It is certainly hard to think of a more laughably blatant one.Not for Massing the sly rake of studs down calf or other such acts of cunningly disguised destructiveness. No, this was full-frontal stuff, cartoonish in its crudeness. Here, the flying Caniggia evades two green shirts but then, splat – the haulage truck, aka Massing, flies into the frame and simply wipes him out.“It’s a nice thing for me,” says Massing with a grin. “Wherever I go, it’s: ‘Ah, he’s the one who did the tackle on Caniggia.’ Everywhere. Everyone says it to me, even when I went to Equatorial Guinea a few years ago for the Africa Cup of Nations. It’s what people recognise me for. So I have to say, it’s affection I get more than anything else, and if it was a source of money, I’d be a rich man.”The cheetah-quick Caniggia had picked the ball up five yards outside his own box. He had passed Kundé as he crossed the halfway line, then hurdled – just – the raised boot of Ndip. Ndip’s nibble had left him striving to regain full balance and his head was down and arms flailing as Massing steamed in.“I was marking Diego Maradona but I left him,” he says. “I thought: ‘If he’s got time to get his balance and pass the ball, we’re stuffed.’ That’s why I came in on him like a truck. I got to Caniggia and flew in on him. I wasn’t thinking that clearly. I was a bit wound up that he’d got past my two colleagues. Knowing that he was breaking clear, and about to get his head up, that was going to be dangerous. And that’s why I really went for it.”He really did. “No leavy go” is what Massing’s defensive partner Ndip, from the Anglophone south-west of Cameroon, would shout at the French-speaking Massing in pidgin English during matches: don’t let him go. There was no leavy go for poor Caniggia.Massing claims he once ran 100m in 10.1sec. In he flew, landing on the Argentinian’s left foot and sending him skidding across the turf. Five Argentina players rushed over to protest to the referee Michel Vautrot, as Massing bent down to pull back on the boot which had left his foot with the force of his challenge.None of the World Cup’s 13 previous opening matches had witnessed a red card. This one had now seen two, with Massing following team-mate André Kana-Biyik into the dressing room. Kana-Biyik thought the match must be over at the sight of his team-mate. “He starts raising his arms and he’s expecting me to do the same,” Massing recalls. “He says: ‘What’s going on?’ So I tell him: ‘No. They’ve sent me off too’.”To underline the size of the shock witnessed by the crowd of 73,780, it is worth noting no team from south of the Sahara had ever won a World Cup finals match before. Three Maghreb nations had – Tunisia in 1978, Algeria in 1982, and Morocco in 1986 – but this was a first for black Africa. And they had not beaten just any team. Rather, in front of 150 countries watching around the world, Cameroon had upset Maradona’s Argentina: the holders felled by the 500-1 outsiders.The impact of Senegal’s scalping of reigning champions France in the opening game of South KoreaJapan 2002 does not compare. Then, Senegal had a starting XI made up entirely of players based in France (compared with only one Ligue 1 player for Les Bleus). Cameroon’s 1990 team, by contrast, included five home-based players, officially termed as amateurs. Only five of their 22-man squad played top-level football abroad. François Omam-Biyik, their match-winner, had – like Massing – spent the preceding season in France’s second tier.For Cameroon, it was the springboard for their history-making run to the quarter-finals. Moreover, it was a match that set the tone perfectly for what was to follow at Italia 90. There was controversy, drama, brutality. There were pantomime heroes and villains. And, at the end of it, huge headlines.To review the action through the softer prism of 21st-century sensibilities invites the occasional shudder, and sympathy for Maradona, who rises wearily off the turf more than once, with something approaching stoicism. The final foul count read Cameroon 28 Argentina 9. Each of substitute Caniggia’s first four runs earned a clattering, with Massing’s crushing contribution still to come.Not that the crowd, who had whistled loudly through Argentina’s anthem, cared. The two red-carded Cameroonians left the pitch to cheers.To the Milanese, Maradona, who had just taken the Serie A title down to Naples, was the bogeyman. When Napoli collapsed spectacularly – and, some suggested, suspiciously – in the 1988 title race, Maradona said: “Today, the racist Italy has won.” During Argentina’s preparatory camp in Austria, he had returned to the same theme, speaking of Napoli’s title triumph as “the revenge of the south against the racist north”.The Argentina captain mined the same seam with his sardonic response following this opening upset: “The only pleasure I got this afternoon was to discover that, thanks to me, the people of Milan have stopped being racist. Today, for the first time, they supported the Africans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a42379467867ac42efbadc420e18eb7b04399cd0/0_81_3734_2240/master/3734.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e04f38d921d19171709acf3a50694294","title":"england world cup 2018 team guide tactics key players and expert predictions","story":"Gareth Southgate’s switch from 4-2-3-1 has given his young side flexibility, with Raheem Sterling central to England’s successThis article is part of the ’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.Gareth Southgate committed to a three-man defence back in the autumn, tweaking the 4-2-3-1 system which had been successfully employed through a comfortable qualification campaign. The manager is now convinced a variation of 3-4-3 or 3-5-2 is the best way to eke performances and possession from a youthful group.At first glance it appeared a risky tactic given England are not blessed with top quality centre-halves. Yet the decision in March to employ Kyle Walker as the right sided central defender in the back-line, with Kieran Trippier coming in at wing-back, looks inspired. The Manchester City defender tucks in off the flank with his club, and injects pace and forward intent to the national team’s rearguard that will surely have the ball-playing John Stones at its heart, and the hugely promising Harry Maguire, Gary Cahill or Eric Dier on the left. It also allows England to exploit their principal assets: their wing-back options, whether Walker and Trippier on one side, or Danny Rose on the opposite flank.Dier could, of course, feature in defensive midfield and there may be times at the tournament when Southgate feels the need to employ two holding players to shield those at the back. Yet, when England need to be more progressive (against Panama and Tunisia in the group, for example), the 3-5-2 should see two forward thinking No 8s – plucked from Dele Alli, Jesse Lingard or Ruben Loftus-Cheek, for example – and either Dier or, more likely, Jordan Henderson as the central pivot.Given the lack of a natural playmaker, a No 10 who can create from the centre, packing midfield with energy and, in Loftus-Cheek’s case, a blend of skill and power seems a sensible alternative. “I think the system gives us good stability and it gives us easier solutions for our midfield players as well,” said Southgate. “Then there is a possibility to switch with what we play in front of it: maybe get two strikers in for certain games, or two midfielders off a forward, or three in midfield and two forwards.”He certainly has options. If Harry Kane leads the line, he can be supported either by the elusive Raheem Sterling, the promising Marcus Rashford, the party’s leading scorer Danny Welbeck, an out-and-out strike partner in Jamie Vardy, or a pair of attacking midfielders or wingers. Either way, Sterling already feels key to the system. The City player has just enjoyed his most productive club season yet, and brought that form to the England set-up in March. “That was good to see because, if we play 3-4-3, we know Raheem can play the No 10 role as he did against France last year,” said Southgate. “But could he play as one of two forwards when he usually plays on the wing for Manchester City?“We know he likes playing through the middle and his performance reminded me of that little spell at Liverpool where he was behind Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge, running and dribbling through the middle of the park,” Southgate continued. Sterling has yet to illuminate a major finals and so much depends upon whether he is confident and content when the campaign begins in Volgograd.Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup?Ruben Loftus-Cheek goes to the tournament in the best form of his fledgling career. The Chelsea loanee is powerfully built, skilful in possession and deceptively quick across the turf. He thrived on international debut against Brazil in November and has long been championed by Southgate. Which player is likely to disappoint?Harry Kane will be convinced he can claim the tournament’s Golden Boot and, having struggled to make an impact at Euro 2016, will be anxious to make his mark. Yet the ankle injury he sustained in mid-March did blunt his form in Spurs’ jittery run-in. He has appeared rusty in the period since. Will he hit the ground running in Russia? What is the realistic aim for England at the World Cup and why?Passage into the quarter-finals is conceivable and the squad boasts the talent to achieve that goal. It would be welcome after the trauma of Brazil 2014, when England stumbled in their group and effectively exited the tournament six days into their campaign. Anything beyond the last eight is improbable, particularly given the calibre of opponent they would meet at that stage.Dominic Fifield writes for the . Follow him on Twitter here.

As the goalkeeper showcased an extraordinarily varied passing range, crowned by the unerringly accurate, long range, side-foot volley which has become his hallmark, he invariably looked the best inidual on view.Impressed onlookers routinely agreed that Pickford possessed the sort of assured left foot leading coaches pay millions of pounds for. “It’s like watching a top midfielder,” said David Moyes, his manager at the time. “Jordan’s got a very big kick but he’s also got a very good passing range, he can go short, he can go long. Distribution is such a big part of goalkeeping these days and his is very good indeed.”Signed by Everton for £30m last summer, Pickford is also rather useful in central defence. Granted, with the ball at his feet, the 24-year-old often looks a natural-born midfield playmaker but he also seems adept as a classy sweeper.“I played Jordan at centre half in training so he understood what it was like for defenders when keepers came over the top of them for crosses,” recalled Kevin Ball, Sunderland’s former academy manager. “Jordan loved it. He could easily have been a centre half.“When he was in goal, the centre halves would split, hoping to take the ball from him but he’d just ping it upfield perfectly. I’d say ‘play it out Jordan, let them do it,’ but he’d reply ‘why? I’m better than them.’ He wasn’t being a pain, just honest. Jordan has confidence in his ability and his opinions. He’ll challenge you, he’ll say ‘I don’t agree’. I like that.”For his part, Pickford thrived under the exacting taskmaster. “Bally was a great coach who wouldn’t give us any leeway,” said Pickford. “We had to do all the old apprentice jobs, clean the dressing room, put Dubbin on the coaches’ boots.”Ball recognised that Pickford needed challenges and helped ensure that the boyhood Sunderland supporter from Washington, Tyne and Wear, received them.Loan stints at Darlington, Alfreton, Burton, Carlisle, Bradford and Preston duly followed with their fans being treated to not only a series of stunning saves but early glimpses of that trademark rocket like sidefoot volley with which Pickford would later make so many goals for Jermain Defoe in Sunderland’s first team.“There’s no place to hide at places like Darlo and Alfreton,” reflected Pickford who was driven to the latter club’s home games by his parents and would sit in the back seat consuming the chicken and pasta lunches his mother had prepared in a tupperware box as they traversed the motorway network. “Playing for Darlington at 17 I learnt so much. You’re up against men, it’s a physical and mental test against big centre halves needing to pay their mortgages.”The stellar hand-eye co-ordination which would serve him so well was possibly inherited from his father, now a builder but once a gamekeeper on Lord Lambton’s County Durham estate.By the time he reached Preston, Pickford was a star in waiting. “I’ve never seen anyone kick a ball like Jordan can,” says Chris Kirkland, the former Liverpool goalkeeper who deputised for him at Deepdale. “I could never have kicked a ball as far as Jordan.“But the biggest thing about him was his command of the penalty area. All goalkeepers make saves but Jordan’s command of the area impressed me. He came out for crosses and high balls with an authority rare for one so young. He was brilliant.”Such fearlessness was evident as a small boy in Washington. Playing football with his older brother on the family’s asphalt drive the budding goalkeeper threw himself repeatedly onto that unforgiving surface as if it were a soft play area.A similarly unflinching candour, sets Pickford slightly apart from the crowd in today’s sometimes publicly synthetic football world. After Everton recently beat Newcastle United, Sunderland’s great rivals, he married a triumphant Instagram picture with the unapologetically undiplomatic message: “No better feeling than keeping them quiet.”If those north-east roots are the ties that bind the life of an England international who remains close to his family and lives with the girlfriend he has dated since they were 14, Pickford’s imposing amalgam of psychological and physical strength threatens to unnerve opponents in Russia. “Jordan has exceptional wrist and forearm strength,” says Adrian Tucker, Pickford’s goalkeeping coach at Sunderland. “He’s got excellent hands.” Not to mention exceptional feet and an exemplary mindset.For years England have been looking for a No 1 that can take them far in an international tournament.

The spirit is widely available in poor townships and is often made with contaminated water and potentially lethal methanol. One variant, “jet-five”, is spiked with jet fuel, while another contains embalming fluid.The figures for consumption of illegal alcohol exceeded 2014 estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO), which said that illegal and informally produced alcohol accounted for nearly a quarter of all alcohol consumed globally. The Iard report used data from Euromonitor International to look at consumption of illicit alcohol in 26 countries, the majority in Latin America and Africa. It found that in low and middle-income countries, bootleg alcohol accounted for a “sizeable proportion” of total sales. The report, Alcohol in the Shadow Economy, said illicit alcohol contributes to widening health inequalities.The production of illegal alcohol, which is cheaper and often more readily available than regulated alcohol, is largely driven by poverty, the report found, although culture was an important factor. Across Africa, many producers of homebrew are women who are the sole earners for their families.In April police in Indonesia seized alcohol containing mosquito repellent and cough medicine, after 141 people died from organ failure after drinking moonshine liquor, or oplosan. It was the worst case of alcohol poisoning in the country, where 24 people died in 2016, and 12 people died in 2014. Other deaths have occurred over the past decade in Libya, Russia and the Czech Republic, the report said.The combined revenue loss from illicit alcohol in 18 countries mentioned in the report was found to be $1.8bn (£1.5bn). The loss to Colombia in 2015 was $406m  in Mozambique, the loss in 2014 was $285m.Henry Ashworth, Iard CEO and president, said: “What this report tries to do is to show the scale of the challenge and the cost to health, society and to government.“Tackling harmful use of alcohol requires a collaborative and united response from public, private and not-for-profit sectors. But these partnerships can only thrive when there is a broad and regulated private sector able to play its role in improving health and tackling harmful drinking.”He cited South Africa, where communities had flagged concern over disorder, noise and crime associated with unregulated drinking houses or shebeens. A code of practice introduced by inidual owners had helped increase the quality of alcohol produced and allowed the operators to maintain order and prevent harm, while remaining outside government control. He cited the UK’s thriving microbrewery industry as an example of how countries could produce viable alternatives.

In her latest crusade against identity politics, the writer decries the “drunk on virtue” publisher Penguin Random House’s pledge to ensure new authors and colleagues reflect the UK population by 2025, “taking into account ethnicity, gender, sexuality, social mobility and disability”.Why so bad? Because, naturally, it will result in crap books. More ersity, as this all-too-familiar, offensive argument goes, amounts to less quality.“If an agent submits a manuscript written by a gay transgender Caribbean who dropped out of school at seven and powers around town on a mobility scooter,” Shriver wrote, “it will be published, whether or not said manuscript is an incoherent, tedious, meandering and insensible pile of mixed-paper recycling.”But what if – and Wide Awoke appreciates this may be unimaginable to Shriver – said gay trans Caribbean person is also a good writer? If he, she or they have, in spite of their talent, been unable to break into an industry that is notoriously white, middle-class and risk-averse? An industry in which a writer has more chance of making it on to the bestseller lists if their name is David than if they are from an ethnic minority?Ironically, considering we talk about ersity more than we see it increase, the word and concept appear to be rubbing white privileged people up the wrong way more and more. Recently, another piece, by writer David Brooks – a white man! – outlined what he branded a “misplaced idolisation of ersity” and warned of the dangers of social fragmentation caused by “ersity for its own sake”. But the only real danger ersity poses, which perhaps is threatening to some, is greater inclusion.Conflating ersity with a box-ticking or virtue-signalling exercise misappropriates its true meaning, which, if done properly by genuinely erse decision-makers, is always about excellence. As a BAME, bisexual, female writer (I know, check out all my boxes). I have been on the receiving end of this, erm, pale imitation of ersity many times. The uncomfortable sense of being on a festival panel for tokenistic reasons. The time I won an award and was praised for ticking boxes rather than writing a book. This is not true ersity, but it so easily mimics it.Equality and quality are not mutually exclusive. It is deeply hurtful to say that they are, because it suggests that those of us who fall under ersity’s wide umbrella are not as good, smart or worthy as the establishment that it is merit, rather than prejudice and a certain narrowness of perspective that accompanies privilege, that has held us back. The truth? An “incoherent, tedious, meandering and insensible pile of mixed-paper recycling” can come from anywhere. And so, too, can greatness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c5434024b948c622f04fc544e0e98dac29faef3/0_211_4637_2782/master/4637.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3af5a88e63f1787a345e6ef3a2670be4","title":"tesco sells green lemons as spanish supply sours","story":"Supermarket says South African lemons are mature but need longer to turn yellowTesco has started selling green lemons after relaxing its quality specifications in an attempt to avoid shortages in its UK stores and reduce food waste.Although the skins are slightly green, the fruit is as zesty and robust as lemons that have turned completely yellow, while the flesh inside is ripe and edible.The UK’s largest retailer has lifted its colour requirements for lemons partly to help offset domestic food waste by adding up to an extra two days’ shelf life to the fruit as it ripens.There has also been a shortage of yellow lemons caused by poor growing conditions in Spain, which supplies the UK with the bulk of the fruit until the end of spring.South Africa’s lemon season traditionally begins in late June and it takes over as the UK’s main supplier. However, Tesco will take the greener South African lemons earlier than usual to avoid gaps in its supply.“These greener lemons that we now have on sale are already mature and perfect tasting inside but need longer for the skin to turn yellow,” said Tesco’s citrus fruit buyer Savia Weidinger-Reich. “With the South African crop, that happens towards the end of June as evenings cool, which helps the fruit to colour. The move not only means that shoppers will again be easily able to buy a fruit that is growing in popularity, but they will gain extra freshness.”The greener lemons – the same price as regular yellow ones – are unlikely to be confused with limes as they have the more distinctive, elongated shape of lemons. Last year, Tesco started selling green satsumas and clementines to reduce food waste.The retailer says it is committed to reducing food waste throughout its supply chain and works with farmers and suppliers to adjust crop specifications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ade4419ee3c19292d3990f74a4a645efca3337ed/0_11_999_599/master/999.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=190b9331b34036033fcd4091e1dd7eef","title":"beyond poppies six things you didnt know about the royal british legion","story":"From supporting veterans in emergency situations to providing breaks for service families, Legion initiatives offer a vital helping hand to serving and former members of the armed forcesBeing a member of the armed forces can be high risk and many personnel leave with life-changing injuries. The Royal British Legion provides high quality recovery and rehabilitation support to ex-service personnel who find themselves wounded, injured, sick, or who are experiencing multiple challenges such as being out of work, dealing with mental health problems, financial issues and alcohol abuse.The programme’s flagship is the £27m Battle Back Centre at Lilleshall in the West Midlands, which provides sports and adventure activities designed to promote self-confidence and improve motivation to aid recovery. Tailored programmes help the wounded cope with both physical and psychological challenges.For most, leaving the armed forces means starting a completely new career. The Legion offers a wide range of services designed to help ex-service men and women find employment including Civvy Street – a dedicated website, which lists job vacancies and provides online training resources and information on changing careers. The Legion can also provide funding for additional training or education through its employment support grant scheme.Anyone planning on starting a business will also be supported in their ambition. The Legion provides guidance on business plans, finances and tax requirements. Specialist assistance is also available to put together a business plan, source funding and even find mentors.Not everyone is a DIY whiz and not all former members of the services are equipped to tackle repair jobs. However, rather than booking a handyman, The Royal British Legion provides a handy van service across 21 counties to help with minor home adaptations and repairs for older or less able veterans and their families. The fully trained team assists with maintenance round the home – covering everything from putting up shelves and grab rails to building access ramps and storage sheds to provide shelter for personal mobility vehicles.They can also install the Legion’s system of care phones. A type of personal alarm, a care phone is a telephone-based unit worn on a user’s wrist or neck that can be used to summon help in an emergency.It can be tough and stressful for families and children of those serving in the armed forces. Often some light relief can make a real difference, but taking a much-needed holiday can prove difficult for those on a tight budget. The Legion provides a range of welfare services including week-long adventure breaks for children. These breaks offer a great opportunity for youngsters to have fun, make new friends, have new experiences and improve their self-esteem while giving parents a well-earned break.Parents are not left out either. Week-long breaks for service families are offered at four Legion centres in traditional British seaside resorts during the Easter, summer and October school holidays. Guests are free to take in the sea air while exploring the coast or visiting local tourist attractions. The breaks offer rest and recuperation for people recovering from life-changing events such as illness or bereavement.In the UK today, one in six people over 80 has dementia and by 2025 more than a million people could have the condition. Inevitably, former members of the services feature in these figures. The Royal British Legion provides care in the shape of its purpose built dementia wings at four of its six residential care homes in Somerset, Warwickshire, Norfolk and north Yorkshire, as well as specialist, admiral nurses – developed in partnership with Dementia UK – who work in the community. Currently operating in Lancashire, the west Midlands, Hampshire and Somerset, admiral nurses offer specialist support, information and advice to the family carers of people living with dementia within the armed forces community.Leaving the armed forces means having to deal with an array of financial issues that can be confusing if you’re not prepared for them. Bring in The Royal British Legion’s team of benefits and money advisers. This financial team provides support and guidance in the event ex-service people and their families suffer money problems or need guidance to help set up a new home or access benefits. It also provides help with debt and other unexpected crises, plus support through grants.The Legion has set up MoneyForce, a dedicated website designed to improve understanding of financial issues with information on essentials such as interest charges or buying a home. Managed in partnership with the Ministry of Defence and Standard Life Charitable Trust, the scheme has saved beneficiaries £70m through increases in benefits, tax credits, writing off debts and gaining grants since it began in 2007. It gives ex-service men and women the skills they need to manage their money, smoothing the transition to civilian life.To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ef6fe4450a7e99b3a72f4e7ea3552214cf10b3/0_153_2799_1679/master/2799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5c23e9345f63d34c0f2c02fb7b9c098","title":"from medical discharge to the london marathon one military couples story of resilience","story":"When Mike Kiff was discharged from the army, chronic pain and depression threatened to end his marriage, but with support from The Royal British Legion he and his wife have rebuilt their life togetherIn 2005, Cpl Mike Kiff fell from a roof and dislocated his shoulder badly while on active duty. The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd9b0086b181548bd323ca738abff8b831cd9a3b/0_210_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0aa9bb2d8930295ed85386d22b40d55","title":"how one marine lost his dream job but found meaning helping other veterans","story":"When a freak injury ended marine Nick Fleming’s chances of ever seeing active deployment, he left the services unsure of what to do next. But it wasn’t long before The Royal British Legion answered that question for himNick Fleming had always wanted to be a marine. After joining the service in February 2014, and enduring eight months of gruelling training, he was devastated when his career came to end because of a knee injury. The fact that it happened while on a rugby league pitch, rather than during deployment, added insult to injury. “It was my dream job,” he says. “To have it taken out from under my feet before it even got started was a pretty tough one to take.”The 28-year-old had been posted to Plymouth as part of the Royal Marines’ 42 Commando unit and would spend two years in rehabilitation, undergoing a number of operations to try and repair the damage. Eventually, under his surgeon’s advice, he had to admit defeat and accept that he wouldn’t be able to continue as a Royal Marine . He was medically discharged in October 2017 – only three and a half years after he’d joined the service. “One of the top knee surgeons in the south west said it was time to rethink my career. I potentially could have stayed on as a clerk or in the store, but it’s not really what I joined up to do. So it was decided I’d leave.” For service men and women who leave the forces, adjusting to civilian life can be a challenge. Fleming admits he didn’t really know what he wanted to do after he left the marines. “I had no clear direction,” he says, but decided to move to London to be with his girlfriend. He had come across The Royal British Legion while in rehabilitation, attending the charity’s Battle Back Centre in Lilleshall, which supports sick and injured armed forces personnel. While there, he took part in indoor climbing and golf sessions, and completed a wheelchair basketball coaching qualification. In London, he saw a job advert for an advice and information officer at the Legion’s Pop-In Centre and applied. He now helps others make the same transition as he did, and offers welfare support to the armed forces community as needed. Working in an office has been a real culture change, but he admits he’s found the work really rewarding. “We were able to talk to him, find him accommodation, get him a deposit and kit out the property. We gave him a fresh start and took that worry off him, so he could start getting his life back together.”Many of the charity’s beneficiaries are dealing with mental health issues, often related to their time in the services. Fleming has completed a mental health first aid course with the Legion to help those who come through the centre’s doors. The other common issue is accommodation – particularly in London. Some of the men and women leaving the service won’t have a plan in place for where they’re going to live afterwards and will panic about leaving it to the last minute. The Legion can help with finding somewhere suitable, offering grants for deposits or furnishings, or with filling out benefit forms. Fleming can also signpost beneficiaries to other services, such as counselling and physiotherapy. For him, the most challenging part of his work is learning to deal with the stress and responsibility of other people’s problems. Golf, which he was introduced to at the Battle Back Centre while in rehabilitation, has become an important coping mechanism.“Not only am I coming to terms with losing my career and moving to London, trying to find somewhere to live, all of that stuff, but you’re also picking up other people’s issues, which are constantly going through your mind,” he says. “Golf sounds really boring but if I need to unwind, that’s what I’ll go and do.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ff3067600800f04a2da10647e54e5e32ec7e10/0_2072_4912_2948/master/4912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d0aec84bb2060bf6c59fc36a7dfec07","title":"jeremy vine to take over wright stuff slot on channel 5","story":"Show to relaunch in autumn, with Matthew Wright doing his final programme this weekThe Wright Stuff is to be renamed after it was announced that the BBC Radio 2 host Jeremy Vine will be taking over as host of the long-running Channel 5 chatshow in the autumn.Matthew Wright quit as the host of his eponymous morning programme this year after 18 years. He is due to present his final programme this week.It will then relaunch in September with a new name and fronted by Vine. The show broadcasts for two hours every weekday between 9.15am and 11.15am.A BBC spokesperson confirmed Vinewould continue to host his flagship Radio 2 phone-in show, which airs from 12-2pm. The presenter will be required to dash across London from ITN’s studios on Gray’s Inn Road in north London, where the Wright Stuff is filmed, to Radio 2’s base in Wogan House, close to Regent Street in west London.“Matthew Wright has built a brilliant show that’s a big part of the British TV landscape,” Vine said. “I’m delighted to be carrying on all the conversations he has started, with all the guests he’s made me feel I know over the years.”Vine recently took a voluntary pay cut before the reduction he was earning between £700,000 and £749,999 at the BBC. As well as his radio programme he presents the quiz show Eggheads and provides statistical analysis for political events.Wright quit his Channel 5 show after almost two decades, saying he wished to spend more time with his wife and step away from the rigours of presenting a daily show.The decision came soon after the Channel 5 show changed production companies to ITN Productions. It also followed a dispute over comments made on the show in March by The Chase star Anne Hegerty about the transgender activist Paris Lees, which went unchallenged by Wright. At the time MailOnline claimed Wright had refused an instruction from the production company to apologise for the comments on the following day’s programme, prompting him to be replaced by a guest presenter. Ofcom recently cleared the broadcaster of wrongdoing over the incident.

We’d rather discounted it, but it’s a real possibility again.”Cable, who was among those who sent out warnings before the 2008 financial crash, said leaving the EU without a deal would be “potentially catastrophic”. Asked if he could think of a policy disaster of similar magnitude he said: “Not really. There have been disastrous errors on policy – Iraq, Suez – but nothing like this.” He urged Theresa May to stand up to hardline Brexiters, such as the European Research Group of Tory MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.“I can’t understand why she won’t take on the hard right of the party. The chances of them actually dislodging her are not high,” he said. “You’d have thought she’d say, we’ve reached the limit of what we can do, and I’m going to go ahead in the customs unionsingle market framework, and you guys will have to put up with it. And she would have the support of the rest of parliament and would carry the country.”Cable has had mixed success as the Lib Dem leader since regaining his Twickenham seat at the 2017 election, but the party was buoyed by better-than-anticipated results in May’s local elections. It is hoping for another boost from the Lewisham East vote, which was prompted by Heidi Alexander’s decision to resign from the safe Labour seat for a role with London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan.“We’re looking for a substantial improvement in our vote share – we’d certainly expect to overtake the Tories,” he said, sitting alongside the party’s candidate, the charity consultant Lucy Salek, in a cafe in the south-east London constituency.“There is a very, very outside possibility of winning, but given the size of the margin it will be difficult to do that.”Salek argued that with Labour complacent and the Conservatives largely absent there was scope for the Lib Dems to profit from concerns about Brexit in the heavily pro-remain constituency, where the issue has been mentioned “over and over again” on doorsteps.Cable said the party’s policy of calling for a public vote on a final Brexit deal was proving popular.“Brexit wasn’t very clearly defined at the time, in what it entailed,” he said. “That’s all the more reason for having a vote on the outcome, and that’s beginning to have a certain amount of resonance with voters.”One notable element of the byelection is the decision of the Labour candidate, Janet Daby, to support continued UK membership of the single market and customs union, contrary to party policy.While the Lib Dems question whether Daby has reined in her stance on Brexit under pressure from her party hierarchy, Cable said Labour isions before key votes on the EU withdrawal bill this week pointed to tensions reminiscent of the era when the Social Democratic party split away from Labour.Asked whether another centrist party could emerge, he said: “It could happen. Obviously, the SDP history, at least as it’s retold, is given as a warning about not repeating history. But I think some Labour MPs are being put in an impossible situation. We’ll see that when the votes come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c2a6b9f1f1c0ce71cd5d2dc372a0f88c5d010ac/0_78_5144_3088/master/5144.jpg?w=500\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ed580f9a98de5e944114ee4d6b7c6adb 1000w","title":"rees mogg no need for customs checks at dover in no deal brexit","story":"Legal experts dismiss Tory MP’s vision, saying it would breach WTO rulesJacob Rees-Mogg has said that there would be no need for customs checks at Dover on EU imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit, suggesting that any delays for exports to Europe would be France’s responsibility.The leading Conservative party Brexiter said checks would not be needed because EU goods could be trusted.However, his vision was immediately dismissed by legal experts as a breach of World Trade Organization rules because it would amount to discriminatory practice.In a phone-in on London radio station LBC he told a concerned caller from the Kent town that he had no need to worry.“The delays will not be at Dover, they will be at Calais,” Rees-Mogg told him, claiming that the French would have to conducts checks under EU law, but the UK would not as it would have taken back control of its borders. Nathaniel, who did not give his surname, called to ask Rees-Mogg when the government was going to “take seriously” the problems local people would face with congestion if there is no deal. He said locals had already dubbed the government’s plans “Operation Stack on steroids”, a reference to the existing scheme which is put in place in the event of disruption.Rees-Mogg, who is head of the European Research Group of MPs, told him: “There will be no need to have any delays on goods coming in from the continent in the event we leave with no deal, because goods that are safe on 29 March will be safe on 30 March and that means inbound traffic ought not to suffer any delays because it will be our choice.”He also claimed that if the French insisted on checks, lorries could ert to other ports in Europe.“If we leave without a deal and the French say your goods can’t come in via Calais, which is possible, but then there are other ports and Rotterdam and Antwerp have been increasing their infrastructure and taking on more customs officers,” he said.His vision was dismissed as confused by the British Ports Association. “It is difficult to see a situation where food and other products could be legally imported from another customs territory without being subject to some kind of border check. We understand that government may choose to waive these in event of no deal but we are not sure of the basis of that decision. Presumably that would be an emergency option and it is certainly not a comfortable fallback position in the medium or long term,” said Richard Ballantyne, the BPA’s chief executive.Legal experts also questioned Rees-Mogg’s claims and said they could break WTO rules.“The basic idea that we will check non-EU goods but not check EU if there is no trade deal done with the EU or a customs union agreement will violate the basic rules of the WTO, because that would be deemed discriminatory,” said Steve Peers, professor or law at the University of Essex and EU law expert. Quite apart from the “narrow” issue of customs checks, there would also be an issue for suppliers such as car manufacturers because some “parts go back and forth across the channel several times”, Peers added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/457bb4ece73b7d2eeaf3ba805a5a5ebfd4f24582/0_45_4039_2424/master/4039.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81dba258322924f58882b2721fe49559","title":"brexit jacob rees mogg hosts lbc phone in politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenIf I have heard one view I’ve heard 100 different views about what that law should look like.

The questions covered leadership qualities and voting intention.We asked about eight leadership qualities and, on each measure, we asked whether Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn did best.ICMs Alex Turk says the detailed figures show remain supporters and leave supporters answer the trust question differently. He writes:Here are the figures:(This post went up earlier, but one of the graphics was garbled, and so we had to take it down. Apologies if you saw it and have been wondering where it went.)ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of 2,021 adults aged 18+, between 8 and 10 June 2018. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules.I will post the tables here later when they go up on the ICM website.My colleague Peter Walker has translated some of the lines in May’s statement into what-it-really-means English.Here are the main points from May’s statement.As was clear over the weekend, there was strong debate, and disagreement on some issues. But after detailed discussions between both leaders and our teams, we were able to find common ground and draw up a communique which reflected these discussions and the agreements we reached.I want to pay a particular tribute to Prime Minister Trudeau for his leadership and skilful chairing, which enabled us - after two days of negotiation between leaders - to agree actions and a shared approach on some of the most pressing challenges facing the international community and our citizens.May’s comments seemed as an implicit rebuke to the White House after a Trump adviser said, at the end of the G7 summit, that there was “a special place in hell” for the Canadian prime minister because he had shown “bad faith” and stabbed Trump in the back. But when May was asked by Jeremy Corbyn to explicitly criticise those comments, she sidestepped the question.We need to make the international rules-based trading system work better, so the benefits of free trade can be felt by all. And that includes encouraging the World Trade Organisation to operate more effectively in supporting a global economy that works for everyone. Multilateral action is the right way to achieve this. It cannot be done by taking unilateral action against your partners.So at this summit, we expressed deep disappointment at the unjustified decision of the United States to apply tariffs to steel and aluminium imports. The loss of trade through tariffs undermines competition, reduces productivity, removes the incentive to innovate – and ultimately makes everyone poorer. And in response, the EU will impose countermeasures. We need to avoid a continued tit-for-tat escalation. That is why it was right that we had such an open and direct discussion at this summit. And why, as a champion of free trade, the UK will continue to support a constructive dialogue. As long-standing allies we do not make progress by ignoring each other’s concerns but rather by addressing them together. Trudeau or Trump?May jokes that she does not know what activities Blunt might be referring to.Labour’s Diana Johnson asks if the special relationship with the US is stronger or weaker with President Trump in the White House.May says is continues to be strong. And because it is strong, the UK can tell the US when it disagrees with what it is doing, she says.Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, says he wants to spoil the consensus. Trump has got a point, hasn’t he? China is building up a massive trade surplus, he says.May says the emerging countries which are not playing by the rules-based order need to be brought within it.Labour’s Chris Bryant says there is a growing trend towards protectionism in the world.May says she agrees that any moves to extent protectionism are worrying. But the debate on this focuses on tariffs, she says. She says trade is about more than tariffs. She does not want to see tariffs replaced by other barriers to trade.Here is the text of May’s statement.UPDATE: Sorry, this link is to the statement May delivered at the end of the summit on Saturday. I will post a link to today’s statement when it goes up on the Number 10 website.Labour’s Ben Bradshaw asks how May reponded when Trump said Russia should be let back in. And shouldn’t the police now investigate links between Russia and the leave campaign?May says that the police investigate is up to them. She says Russia was kicked out of the G8 after the annexation of Crimea. She says she has opposed letting it back in until it changes its attitude.Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, asks what is the point of the G7. The most powerful member does not believe in a rules-based system. And India and China are not involved. Shouldn’t it be closed down?May says Cable should look at the conference communique.Sir Michael Fallon, the Conservative former defence secretary, asks how the rapid response mechanism set up at the G7 to respond to Russian aggression will work.May says there will be faster attribution when Russia does something. And then the G7 countries will work together to retaliate.Labour’s Hilary Benn says, under May’s Brexit backstop plan, the UK will remain in a customs union with the EU until the end of 2021 or longer.May says the point of the backstop is that it is there in case new trade rules are not in place. She says she wants new arrangements to be in place by the end of 2020. She hopes the backstop won’t be used."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0b1b67a865464cd7cd4bf00ef876da719b25b6/0_87_2094_1256/master/2094.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4cdaa288a0a5b57a83c351804308841","title":"when size does matter big beasts last of the giants in pictures","story":"Patrick Aryee’s gets up close and personal with some of the world’s biggest creatures in his new three-part series.

Dr Charlene Wong, co-author of the research from Duke University in North Carolina, said the research could help to direct public health interventions, noting that the study suggests the focus should be on females, young adults and those from minority and low-income backgrounds.“Our black female young adults were the least likely to say they did any physical activity and those who did were active for the shortest amount of time,” she said. Writing in the journal Jama Pediatrics, Wong and colleagues describe how they pooled and analysed data from an annual nationwide health survey in the US, encompassing the years 2007 to 2016, focusing on responses from 9,472 iniduals aged between 12 and 29.The survey, carried out through interviews, asked participants questions about their levels of physical activity relating to sports or recreational pursuits.For those who did get their blood pumping, the amount of time spent exercising also fell with age, from just over 71 minutes a day for adolescent boys to just over 50 minutes for those aged 25 to 29. For girls, it fell from 56 minutes to just over 39 minutes a day respectively.White adolescent boys were the most likely to say they exercised in a week, with black males aged 18-24 reporting the longest duration of physical activity a day.Once factors including weight, education and income were taken into account, the team found race was linked to whether females reported any physical activity: in general, a larger proportion of white females said they exercised than black or Hiic participants. The trend was less clear for males.Higher income was linked to reporting physical activity for females regardless of age, but the same only held true for adolescent boys and not young men, while young adults with a college education were more likely to report any exercise across both sexes. Weight had little impact on whether participants reported exercising.While it is not clear what is behind the trends, the authors say multiple factors might be at play including issues around body image, social norms for exercise being different between the sexes, less scheduled activity after leaving school and growing pressures of working life.But the study had limitations, including that activity such as walking to work was not included, it was not considered whether participants had children, or were pregnant, and the authors admit that self-reported data can lead to an over-estimation of activity. Dr Gavin Sandercock, an expert in child activity and fitness from the University of Essex who was not involved in the study, said the findings mirror certain trends seen in the UK, including that females exercise less than males and that physical activity drops across both sexes with age.While he noted there are already some campaigns aimed at encouraging girls and women to exercise, including This Girl Can, he said it was also important to help iniduals of both sexes from lower income groups to become physically active. “We know that if you get children more active, as well as getting more physically healthy, they get happier and their educational attainment improves,” he said.Joan Duda, professor of sport and exercise psychology at the University of Birmingham, said offering a choice of activities and cultivating a sense of empowerment is key: “We need to do more to promote participation in physical activity in the case of adolescent females, and males, not just taking it up or giving a particular activity ‘a go’ but also how to sustain quality engagement,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e732c96e4afc6601fed91c7d2d0839d1ac155446/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daeee7fd8990fa2e576ef9ce7785c620","title":"the hemp revival why marijuanas cousin could soon be big business","story":"The useful crop has seen renewed interest alongside legalized weed – and there are signs that US officials are warming to itLong associated with the hoariest hippie stereotypes, hemp is now chic.The crop – which is a cannabis plant very similar to marijuana, but lacking its best-known property: getting you high – is a versatile raw material, and like its more notorious relative, it could once again become very lucrative.The spread of marijuana legalization has sparked renewed interest not because of hemp wallet fanatics – but due largely to demand for CBD, a chemical both it and marijuana produce in which some see potential as a pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement. But the climate is changing. In recent weeks, the US Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a conservative Republican who opposes marijuana legalization, has called for hemp to be legalized, a move which would benefit farmers, though McConnell still opposes marijuana legalization. And it’s not just the farmers in McConnell’s home state of Kentucky who would be pleased to see a resurgence of the crop. Early this month for hemp history week, the US Senate unanimously passed a non-binding resolution acknowledging hemp’s economic value and “historical relevance”.China, though wary of marijuana, has emerged as a hemp “superpower”, according to a fascinating 2017 story in the South China Morning Post. While hemp is indigenous to China, Chinese research advanced only recently in 1970 when the military used it for uniforms that would be more comfortable in the Vietnamese jungle. Today, the Morning Post notes, China holds more than half of the world’s more than 600 hemp-related patents. Hemp’s revival is only the latest chapter in a long history.In China, hemp has been used to make fabric and rope for more than 3,000 years. A Chinese eunuch named Cai Lun, who is credited with inventing paper during the early Christian era, used hemp as one of his source materials. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, hemp rope, sails and rigging were so vital to the British Royal Navy that the supply was considered a national security issue. Both Henry VIII and Elizabeth I encouraged growing the crop. In the US, some of the founding fathers grew hemp. Stoner lore has it that the constitution and declaration of independence were written on hemp. It’s not true – they were written on parchment – but drafts of the documents probably were. But interest in hemp waned as cotton, a finer fabric dependent on American slave labor, ascended. It was last a relevant crop in the US during the second world war, when the Department of Agriculture made a Hemp for Victory film and encouraged production. Today’s hemp advocates, a passionate cohort indeed, claim paper, cloth and biofuel made from hemp are all environmentally and economically attractive, relative to the prevailing current methods. If hemp became a major source for any one of these staples, it would be an immense opportunity, akin to legal marijuana.And there are more uses for hemp still. The seeds are a good source of protein, popular with vegans. Hemp can also be made into a building material known as hempcrete, which is currently easier to access in parts of Europe than in the US. A bridge in sixth-century Gaul was built from hempcrete. Bryan DeHaven’s Colorado-based clothing company, Chiefton Supply Co, makes T-shirts from a hempcotton blend. The component organic hemp is grown, processed into fabric and then stitched into apparel all at one facility in China’s Shangdong province.DeHaven said hemp’s benefits included that it needed substantially less water than cotton to grow. The resultant cloth, he said, also had anti-bacterial properties Chiefton is working with sportswear companies on breathable hemp clothing for athletes. “Those guys are really putting our garments to the test,” he said. Eventually, DeHaven said, he would like to see Chiefton hemp goods produced in the US “from seed to seam”. It will be difficult. Hemp is not completely illegal in the US but the current rules are wildly convoluted, probably even more so than those for marijuana. But the laws weren’t the main problem, DeHaven said. You can’t make hemp clothing in the US because the country no longer has sufficient expertise in textile production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b68ccd5e900c4ce756f3e01a67c0fdd221340b69/0_120_2473_1483/master/2473.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6f123f5c91a742113781fbb8854219a","title":"scotland target test status couple years","story":"Scottish cricket’s feelgood factor rolls on, with their chairman talking of a possible step up to Test status and Calum MacLeod, the star of the historic win over England, joining Derbyshire for this summer’s Twenty20 Blast.MacLeod, whose unbeaten 140 from only 94 balls put the world’s top ODI side to the claymore at the Grange on Sunday, is centrally contracted by Scotland and so will be on a free loan to the Falcons, who also get his head coach, Grant Bradburn, joining their set-up.This dual deal is the product of a partnership with Cricket Scotland and sees them link up with Safyaan Sharif too, the seamer whose final wicket of Mark Wood lbw sparked heady scenes and is already at Derbyshire in a similar capacity.Certainly their first win over England, following victories over Afghanistan, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka in the past 12 months (the latter in an unofficial 50-over match), has Scotland dreaming big. Ireland needed a decade of giant killings to get Test status but the Cricket Scotland chairman, Tony Brian, hopes to be quicker.“I can see us getting there in the next couple of years,” Brian told BBC Scotland. “The ICC set strict criteria for us to meet for full member status and we’re only two away. We probably need one more win against a top nation and our women’s team, who are also rapidly improving, need to do well at a World Cup qualifier.”While Kyle Coetzer’s team now turn their attention to the first of two Twenty20s at home to Pakistan on Tuesday – can they make it a famous double against this format’s No\u0026nbsp1 side? – England are dusting themselves down before their one-day series opener against Australia at the Oval on Wednesday.Into the squad comes the rested Jos Buttler – the unused Dawid Malan returns to Middlesex – while Jake Ball joins a bowling group chastened by shipping 371 runs in 50 overs. Tom Curran, Surrey’s box of tricks right-armer, got away with carrying the drinks against Scotland and will surely push for selection on his home ground.Without the injured Ben Stokes providing a sixth bowling option, and new-balldeath specialist Chris Woakes similarly on the sidelines, Eoin Morgan’s attack still appears to lack cutting edge something exposed when, for the first time ever, four of the five conceded 70 runs or more, with Moeen Ali’s 10 overs the thriftiest at 65 runs.Liam Plunkett is England’s highest placed bowler in terms of strike rate since the last World Cup, sitting 20th, while David Willey sent down 10 overs for the first time in two years but worryingly did not swing the ball. Perhaps Morgan was too hasty in dismissing the idea of Jofra Archer being part of the plans next summer, subject to the Barbados-born quick profiting from a change in qualification rules.Jonny Bairstow, whose blistering 105 appeared to have broken the back of the run chase, only for the middle order to fold, is confident of a renewed showing against an Australia side lacking five first-team players via injury or suspension.He said: “It’s a completely different challenge. There will be Australia players who will want to be competing for their places all the way through that side. We know how dangerous that can be when people are pushing for a permanent place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7127dfdf89a82902f07c92ebffbd2795818e757/0_148_4426_2655/master/4426.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d5696eeda526e59e36d4e4242db4d12","title":"andy murray same big beasts return jungle","story":"The tennis jungle Andy Murray is preparing to re-enter – possibly next week at Queen’s Club – will not be noticeably different to the one from which he hobbled away a year ago.Roger Federer will be easing back into shape at Halle, having again chosen to skip the clay to save his 36-year-old legs for the grass of the All England Club he finds so suited to his game. Novak Djokovic – despite an uncharacteristically short-tempered exit from Roland Garros, mumbling about uncertainty over his future – will be desperate to get his career back on track where he has won three of his 12 majors. And Rafael Nadal will arrive on the grass – perhaps at Queen’s Club – celebrated as the finest clay-courter of all but with reduced prospects at Wimbledon, where he has not got out of the fourth round since he lost against Djokovic in the 2011 final.As for Murray, the word is he is hitting the ball with purpose and moving freely in practice, easing fears the grass season may pass him by. His team expect him to decide towards the end of the week if he is ready. Although he has put his name down for Washington in August and Shenzhen in September, it is inconceivable he will choose either of those hard courts on which to make his comeback.A more sensible scenario – if he is fit and ready – would be to play Queen’s Club, where he feels comfortable and has won five times, to see how his mind and body hold up under the stress of match conditions. It is a small, high-quality field and, even if he lost, he would have a far better idea of how he may fare at Wimbledon, the scene of his last competitive match. If he got back to winning, he would be in a much better frame of mind.It would be folly to walk straight on to the main stage at Wimbledon without rehearsing his lines at Queen’s. He will not be seeded, for a start – and ranked outside the top\u0026nbsp150 – so could draw any of the major contenders in the first round. To lose in a five-set match against Federer, say, in front of his home audience on Centre Court or Court No\u0026nbsp1 would not be a pleasant experience for anyone – except, maybe, Federer.For now, the man of the moment is Nadal. His 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 win against Dominic Thiem on Court Philippe Chatrier on a stifling Sunday afternoon was a dogged rather than outstanding performance but he did what he needed to do. He dropped one set in the whole fortnight – in the quarter-finals against Diego Schwartzman – and had a couple of other tough moments but, generally, he ruled Roland Garros with the same imperious strut he showed in his first final, 13 years ago. Now he has La Undecima. If nothing else, he is improving everyone’s French.It is easy to take Nadal for granted. He has been at or near the top of the game for so long he is expected to deliver excellence and victories every time he steps on to a court, especially with the red clay underfoot. And, while he always reminds us there are no certainties in sport, over five sets on his favourite surface, the Spaniard is invincible if he wins the first set – he has prevailed 95 times in those\u0026nbspcircumstances.Johanna Konta is due to start her campaign against Kurumi Nara on Tuesday.

Four players on or outside the top\u0026nbsp100 have beaten him at Wimbledon in the past seven years: Lukas Rosol, Steve Darcis, Nick Kyrgios and Dustin Brown. Last year the 34‑year‑old left-hander Gilles Müller ground him down in five sets in the fourth round.Nadal has struggled with pain and injury to his knees and related joints and muscles for most of his career, which has made the task of getting down lower to handle the skidding ball on grass that much more difficult. Yet his uncle, Toni, who is still a considerable presence in the Nadal camp now run by Carlos\u0026nbspMoya, thinks he can win a third Wimbledon title – which is touching. But unrealistic.Federer, though, is a different beast. His body mechanics could not be more different to the muscular intensity of Nadal, and the Swiss husbands his resources like a miser. He has picked up injuries, also, but made the most remarkable comeback from knee surgery in 2016 to win the Australian Open last year – and do it again a year later. He also squeezed in an eighth Wimbledon title, of course, with Nadal, Murray and Djokovic all cut down way before the final weekend.This may be the last time the Big\u0026nbspFour contest the championship together. It cannot be guaranteed any will still be playing a year from now, although Nadal gave no indication in Paris that he has any retirement plans.We should enjoy them while we can, while they are still willing and able to put the hours in on and off the court, striving as they have done for more than a decade to outdo each other.

Plays are programmed several months in advance sometimes theatre reveals itself to be aware of growing tensions in communities before they make the news. While the clashes between generations in immigrant families have been explored in Nine Night at the National Theatre and a revival of Leave Taking at the Bush, Shebeen focuses on simmering tensions in the days before a 1950s race riot. All three plays are set within the home, but in Shebeen the central conflict is with the racism of the outside world.We spend 24 hours with Pearl (Martina Laird) and George (Karl Collins), a loved-up Jamaican couple in St Ann’s, Nottingham, who run an unlicensed “shebeen” or pub-style gathering in their damp-ridden house. The supporting cast shine: Rolan Bell’s smooth-talking Earnest and Danielle Walters’ pained Gayle, who is sacked for working faster than her white colleagues, show the complexities and hardships of the immigrant experience. An interracial couple, Linford and Mary (Theo Solomon and Chloe Harris), struggle against hostility and come across as so tenderly in love that they are easy to root for.But it is Laird’s Pearl who anchors the play, her excellent, steely performance saying so much about the strength that Windrush-era black matriarchs had to show – even if they didn’t always feel it. Alongside Collins’ strong turn as George, the conflicted ex-boxer who just wants the best for his family, the cast brings the best out of Mufaro Makubika’s script, which won the 2017 Alfred Fagon award.Makubika’s writing can be funny but he doesn’t often go for easy laughs, instead letting tension slowly build around his characters. The dialogue is also stripped back pauses and silence are given space to sit in the air. Matthew Xia’s unhurried direction pulls everything together to a tense climax. Grace Smart’s detailed design, focused on Pearl and George’s central living-room space but with a half-seen hallway and kitchen, makes the action on stage feel claustrophobic, as does the spot lighting and subtle static soundscape. The play ends a little abruptly, but perhaps it needs to. A thick, vaudeville-style draped curtain hangs at the back of the set, intermittently lit up to suggest that the immigrants’ home life itself feels like either a performance or a dream. The empire that courted Pearl, George and their Jamaican neighbours is proven to be little more than a dream of their own making, and as the play ends and the promise of violence grows, that dream comes crashing down around them. In many ways, for immigrants like them, it still is."},{"url":null,"title":"john oliver mueller investigation if this is a witch hunt witches exist","story":"Oliver discussed Fox News’s attempts to discredit the inquiry, from ‘whataboutism’ to pro-Trump counter-narrativesOn Last Week Tonight, John Oliver discussed the numerous ways Republicans and conservative media have attempted to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation over the past year.He began: “We thought we’d update you on the ongoing Trump administration scandals that we’ve been calling Stupid Watergate, a scandal potentially on the scale of Watergate but where everyone involved is dumb and terrible and bad at everything.“Last month marked the one-year anniversary of the Mueller investigation,” Oliver said, showing news segments of Trump-faithful pundits like Lou Dobbs, Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson referring to the inquiry as a “witch-hunt”.“Yes, they’ve been derisively referring to the Mueller investigation as a witch-hunt, which is a little ironic because you just know if Giuliani, Hannity and Trump had been alive back when people burned witches, they would have front-row seats, toasting marshmallows while trying to conceal their boners,” the host said, adding that the so-called “witch-hunt” has thus far yielded 20 indictments and five guilty pleas. “If this is a witch-hunt, witches exist.”“If you’re thinking, well, ‘I don’t watch Fox News, I tune all of that stuff out,’ it’s actually important that you know what’s been happening on it for reasons that, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, Rudy Giuliani explains best,” Oliver said.“Because when he was recently asked why he was going around spouting unsubstantiated nonsense, he offered this explanation.”In an interview, Giuliani explained that, because Trump’s fate will probably come down to the matter of impeachment, “our jury is the American people”.“He’s related by blood to his first wife,” Oliver said, “but he is right.”“It is the longstanding view of the justice department that you cannot indict a sitting president, so to the extent that Trump can be held accountable, it’s going to be through impeachment, where public opinion is key,” the host explained. Oliver then summarized tactics used by Trump’s supporters to delegitimize the investigation, like redefining the terms of the inquiry itself. “It is important to remember Mueller wasn’t tasked with finding proof of collusion. In actuality he was tasked with looking into links and coordination between the Russian government and anyone associated with the Trump campaign, as well as any matter that arose or may arise directly from the investigation,” said Oliver. “That’s a pretty broad mandate. So saying the investigation has to shut down if there’s no collusion is like saying a game of Scrabble has to end because you fit all the letters in your mouth. “There’s also whataboutism,” Oliver added, “the practice of shifting the debate to someone else’s wrongdoing.”Oliver proceeded to share a clip from Sean Hannity’s show, in which the Fox News host wondered why people like Christopher Steele, the Clintons, Jim Comey and Susan Rice weren’t being prosecuted instead of Trump.“That is a lot of name to throw up on the screen and just say, what about them?” Oliver quipped. “Hannity’s point is that other people did bad things so therefore Trump’s bad things don’t count. Let me be clear on this: whether or not someone else did something shitty has no bearing over whether you did something shitty. If that were true, every movie that got a bad review could simply say, what about From Justin to Kelly?”Finally, Oliver explained how successfully the right has established its own counter-narrative to the special counsel’s inquiry “by framing it as part of a grand conspiracy to bring down Trump”.“Night after night, Hannity paints a picture where the investigation itself is one gigantic scandal, with the Democrats, the FBI, the Deep State and the establishment Republicans teaming up to bring down Trump,” the host added, noting that Hannity is fond of saying that “Spygate” makes “Watergate look like stealing a Snickers bar”.“None of this even addresses the most obvious question,” Oliver said. “If absolutely everyone from Hillary to the FBI to Trey Gowdy was in on a Deep State plan to sabotage Trump, how the fuck is he president right now?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bfb3500adf59d247345c3e11d39ff9193dbbe51/0_154_3296_1979/master/3296.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaa4b318325fd8665a789559c260ce6a","title":"paraguay declared free of malaria by who","story":"Paraguay is officially free of malaria, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday, making it the first country in the Americas in 45 years to have wiped out the deadly disease which is back on the rise globally.With no recorded cases of malaria in five years, Paraguay became the first country in the region to have eliminated malaria since Cuba in 1973, the WHO said. It was the first country to be declared malaria-free since Sri Lanka in 2016. “It gives me great pleasure today to certify that Paraguay is officially free of malaria,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, said in a statement. “Success stories like Paraguay’s show what is possible. If malaria can be eliminated in one country, it can be eliminated in all countries.”While significant progress has been made over the past 20 years in reducing malaria cases and deaths, in 2016, for the first time in a decade, the number of malaria cases rose and in some areas there was a resurgence, the WHO said.Health experts say a growing resistance to the sprays and drugs used to attack the mosquito that transmits the disease and the parasite that causes it was partly to blame. They also say it was partly due to stagnant global funding for malaria since 2010. Climate change and conflict can also exacerbate malaria outbreaks. “This is a powerful reminder for the region of what can be achieved when countries are focused on an important goal,” said Carissa Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization, the WHO’s regional office. “We are hopeful that other countries will soon join Paraguay in eliminating malaria,” she said in a statement. In 2016 the WHO identified Paraguay as one of 21 countries with the potential to eliminate malaria by 2020. The WHO said Algeria, Argentina and Uzbekistan are on track to be declared free from malaria later this year.

File photograph: iStock The second of this year’s higher-level maths papers was very demanding, with some especially tough parts and a nasty surprise, according to teachers.“It was easily the trickier of the two exams,” said Eamonn Toland, founder of TheMathsTutor.ie.“The concepts and skills section had some deceptively tricky questions. For example, the question on the empirical rule had a twist that might have stumped some students, although it could be solved without using the empirical rule.”Mr Toland added: “The two geometry questions were fairly doable but the statistics question was quite difficult. “The students had to be very good at interpreting abstract mathematical results and some of the parts were quite different from previous statistics questions. This is a part of the course that many students find difficult so parts of this question might have stumped quite a few of them.”Luke Saunders, Studyclix.ie founder and a maths teacher at Jesus and Mary Secondary School in Enniscrone, Co Sligo, said that students sitting higher-level maths paper two would have found section A relatively straightforward but that there was a sting in the tail in section B. “Question 8 combined questions on statistics with probability and may have thrown some weaker students,” he said.Mr Saunders was surprised to see a question on sequences and series appear on the paper given that they had been a particularly dominant topic on paper one. Aidan Roantree, senior maths teacher at the Institute of Education in Dublin, said it was a very demanding paper and that to move beyond a H4 or H5, students would have required a very good understanding of the material. “The headline surprise is the inclusion of a question on financial maths on paper two, which normally appears exclusively on paper one,” he said.“The most difficult of the geometry proofs was asked and the B part of question 8 was a completely new in-depth analysis of the margin of error approximation, which was very tough.” However, he said the questions on geometry and trigonometry were generally “very fair”.With regards to the ordinary-level paper, Mr Toland said that section A was easy but section B contained some tricky statistics. The number of atoms in a solid gold sphere was among the topics featured. “The concepts and skills question was fairly straightforward and many of the parts were extremely easy,” he said. “For example, to complete a table that shows the possible values for the sum of two dice the student only needs to be able to add two numbers together. The concepts and applications section had quite a lot of statistics, which is normally a topic reserved for higher level. “Even though the question is fairly straightforward, many students at ordinary-level may not be familiar with the phrase ‘confidence interval’.”Mr Saunders said that students who were comfortable with applying trigonometry and geometry skills would have been happy with today’s paper and that it was typical of what is expected from Project Maths.Q8(c) Acme Confectionary has an employee pension plan.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe Government will open embassies in Ukraine, Morocco, the Philippines and Liberia in the coming years and consulates in Cardiff, Frankfurt and Los Angeles from next year, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said.Speaking at the launch of Global Ireland 2025 plan to double the Government’s representative presence overseas in seven years, Mr Coveney said the new embassies were “high potential location for increased trade for Irish companies but also key parts of the world where Ireland’s voice is not as strong as it needs be”.The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade said the new consulates were in “strategic places” ensuring Ireland stays “close to Britain,” has “deeper connectivity with Germany and the German economy,” and reinforces “the hugely important connections that we maintain with the United States”.The plan was unveiled by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Mr Coveney with Cabinet colleagues Minister for Business Heather Humphreys and Minister for Culture Josepha Madigan along with Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee at a launch at the Irish Aviation Authority in Dublin city centre.The overseas expansion fulfils a proposal made by Mr Varadkar made during last year’s Fine Gael leadership election and follows last October’s announcement of new embassies in New Zealand, Colombia, Chile and Jordan and new consulates in Vancouver and Mumbai.The move comes against the shift to protectionism and unilateralism by the US under President Donald Trump and rise of economic nationalism that led to Mr Trump’s election and the UK’s vote for Brexit.“We are at a moment in world history where we can turn inwards and become irrelevant or we open ourselves to opportunities and possibilities on a global scale that we never had before,” said Mr Varadkar.Referring to the recent shifts in global politics, Mr Coveney remarked: “This is a critical juncture for Ireland. We are seeing close to home the profound impacts of a neighbour choosing a more isolated and isolating path and we are seeing larger allies further afield retreat into protectionism.”The Tánaiste, in response to a question from the media, said the dispute between Mr Trump and other G7 leaders in the aftermath of the weekend summit in Quebec was “very concerning for a lot of people”.“The very public display of disagreement, I think, sends a very unfortunate signal to many parts of the world that desperately need stability from those countries and unity of purpose,” he said.The US president tweeted a string of angry statements criticising the country’s closest allies after other G7 countries criticised his decision to reject a joint communique from the leaders.Mr Varadkar said Ireland opposed the imposition of tariffs on imported steel and aluminium by the US standing in solidarity with France, Germany, Canada and Japan in opposition against them.“Ireland is always on the side of free trade and free enterprise,” he said.The Taoiseach wished Mr Trump “the best” at his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, the first meeting between the two.“Everyone is on the side of denuclearisation and peace and normalisation on the Korean peninsula,” he said.Mr Coveney described the summit as “deadly serious” and an opportunity to “make a big step forward” towards denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula.The Tánaiste joked that a North Korean embassy was “not on the agenda at the moment but who knows what is going to happen in terms of local politics”.Mr Varadkar playfully asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he had any candidates in mind for a potential Irish ambassador in Pyongyang.“No is the answer to that,” he replied. “Not at the moment.”Under the 2025 plan, the Government intends to open 26 new embassies and consulates, adding to the existing network of 80 diplomatic missions staffed by 678 diplomats across the globe.Mr Coveney noted that this was “modest” by international standards.According to the 73-page Global Ireland 2025, Ireland ranked 29th out of 35th for developed countries under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for diplomatic representations.Ireland’s 8.4 staff per mission in diplomatic outposts was lower than those of Sweden, Finland and Denmark, each of which had average staff levels of 17 per mission, and compared with 13 for New Zealand.“We have some road to travel to be on a par if not to overtake some of those countries in terms of presence and influence abroad,” said the Tánaiste.The Government has pledged to meet the long-promised UN target of allocating 0.7 per cent of the gross national income to overseas development aid by 2030, which would amount to an increase from €707 million a year to €2.5 billion a year in 12 years’ time.“This is a big commitment. You can’t do it overnight,” said Mr Coveney.On the Government’s bid to secure one of the rotating seats on the UN Security Council for 2021-22, Mr Coveney said, at that point, post-Brexit, there was the prospect of the EU having France as the only member state on the security, “which will be extraordinary given the role Europe wants to play”.A new Ireland House in Japan, accommodating State diplomatic, promotional and commercial under one roof, would be the most significant investment ever made by the Government in an overseas mission, he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3526994.1528737906!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach criticised for smart alecky cervicalcheck remark","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: “There shouldn’t be any delay in providing patients with their medical records.” Photograph: Laura HuttonPA WireWomen affected by the CervicalCheck controversy should suffer no delay in receiving their medical records but it was “not as simple as taking a book out of a library”, said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Mr Varadkar made his remarks after solicitor Cian O’Carroll accused the HSE of “obstructing” one dying woman who is seeking records from CervicalCheck in relation to details of an unreported smear test causing a delay in the diagnosis and the treatment of her cancer.Mr O’Carroll received the woman’s file from CervicalCheck yesterday evening, a day before he planned to seek a High Court order forcing the screening programme to hand over her records.The woman is among a dozen being represented by the solicitor who are still awaiting medical records, some of whom cannot take legal proceedings without them.Mr O’Carroll criticised the Taoiseach’s remark as “smart alecky”, saying that he did not address the central problem that records simply are not being released by CervicalCheck to some women.“The Taoiseach doesn’t seem to be adequately concerned that six weeks on people are being refused access to their records. It is a simple process,” said Mr O’Carroll.The controversy came to light after terminally ill Limerick woman Vicky Phelan settled a High Court action last month after her cancer was missed in a smear test three years before she was diagnosed.The missed smear test was discovered in 2014, after her diagnosis, but she was not told until 2017.A follow-up HSE investigation found that 209 women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer were not told about subsequent audits showing past smear tests could have provided a different outcome.Asked about the delay in releasing records yesterday, Mr Varadkar said he could not comment on inidual cases but said: “There shouldn’t be any delay in providing patients with their medical records.”He added: “I do appreciate that it is not as simple as taking a book out of a library. Medical records are not often held in one place. They are in different places.”Records can include lab specimens, and samples and records also need to be reviewed first, because there can be private information in medical records belonging to others, he said.“Notwithstanding those constraints and those realities, there should be no delay in making medical records and specimens available to people, and that should be done as quickly as possible,” he said.Mr Varadkar said the State Claims Agency, which handles legal actions against the HSE, will invite people to attend mediation so the women avoid stressful trials. He said many invitations had been issued.“In some cases there hasn’t been a reply,” he said.A spokesman for the agency declined to provide an update on the CervicalCheck-related claims facing the State ahead of its officials appearing before the Public Accounts Committee on Thursday.The HSE has acknowledged delays in responding to solicitors’ correspondence due to the volume of requests but that it was trying to meet its obligations."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3526584.1528718548!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the exceptional weather is coming to an end met %C3%A9ireann","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            People play a game of cards at the beach on Bull Island on a sunny day near Dublin this weekend.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsIt has been as glorious a start to the summer as most of us can remember and the good weather is set to continue for the next few days at least.However, Met Éireann is warning the “exceptional weather” will come to an end later this week.Dublin recorded one of its sunniest weeks on record last week with some 80 hours of sunshine, the equivalent of more than 11 hours a day.Monday will be mild and dry in most places with a respectable 21 degrees in the midlands and east. This is cooler than of late and the sunshine will be more hazy, but still above normal for the time of year.Tuesday will be a similar kind of day and both days will be dry across the country.A notable change is due on Wednesday. The bad news is that rain is forecast across the country for the first time in weeks: the good news is that this will be most welcome by farmers and Irish Water.The rain will appear off the west coast on Wednesday afternoon and gradually extend across the country reaching eastern areas by nighttime.Near drought-like conditions have been experienced across the country for the past three weeks. Dublin has had just 1mm of rain since June 1st and May was exceptionally dry with just a third of the average rainfall recorded for the month.Most places had just trace amounts of rainfall in recent weeks. Even those places that had more normal levels of rainfall in the north and midlands only did so because of heavy thunderstorms last week.There has been several gorse fires over the last few weeks in the Dublin and Wicklow mountains and the dry conditions have caused water shortages in the Skerries area of Dublin.The Department of Agriculture has issued an orange “high risk” forest fire warning that remains in place until Wednesday, June 13th.They have asked public if they see a fire to not delay in reporting a fire to the fire and emergency services.But rain is on the way.“The exceptional weather is coming to an end but we’re not going down the tubes either,” Met Éireann forecaster John Eagleton said.He explained the change in wind direction from south to west will mean a transition to cooler, more showery weather. Nevertheless, the temperatures will still be in the high teens and rainfall amounts will not be above normal.“We’re not going to get lashings of it,” he explained. “It won’t be as sunny as it was, but it will still be very pleasant.”Thursday and Friday will be mostly dry days with temperatures of 16 to 18 degrees - cooler because of the change in wind direction.Mr Eagleton said rainfall amounts over the next 10 days will range from 15mm in the east and midlands to 60mm in the north-west.Some rain is forecast next weekend as there will be more unsettled conditions and southwesterly winds. Monday next week looks like bringing a lot of rain across the country."},{"url":null,"title":"magnum freedom project pictures","story":"1968 was a seismic year of deep societal and political shifts.

sheeran launches hunt great crested newts objections plan","story":"Ed Sheeran has been hit with the curse of the great-crested newt as his plans to build a private chapel on his estate have been put on hold.  The pop star has now been forced to commission experts to hunt for the protected amphibians around his land in East Anglia.The 27-year-old singer-songwriter, who announced his engagement to long-time girlfriend Cherry Seaborn in January, has submitted a planning application for the Saxon-style structure to Suffolk Coastal District Council.But a string of concerns have been raised, including from Suffolk Wildlife Trust which said there were records of great crested newts in the area in 2015 and it is possible that ponds within the site boundaries could be breeding sites for this species.Great crested newts, Britain\u0027s largest newt species, have declined over recent years and are now legally protected.An artist\u0026#39s impression of the chapel Ed Sheeran wants to buildIt is illegal to disturb the animals or obstruct access to areas where they live and breed, with the protected area extending up to 500m from their breeding ponds, the wildlife trust said.Paul Smith, of Apex Planning Consultants, said: The applicant has responded promptly to this matter and has also commissioned an appropriate survey that will identify the presence of great crested newts or otherwise, propose mitigation measures as appropriate and recommend measures to enhance bioersity.These could include bat boxes, swift nesting boxes and native planting, he said.We were not aware of the historical presence of great crested newts nearby and certainly believe that none exist in the pond nearby to the application site, he added.Mr Smith also addressed concerns from people who claim the planned chapel would be unsightly and could draw celebrity-spotters to the area.Ed Sheeran, who was launched a hunt for great-crested newts after objections to his plan for private chapelResponding to one objector who contends that the chapel will attract attention from the public and media, Mr Smith said it would be sited on private land approximately 230m from the road.Therefore we do not agree that at such distance from public land and views it will generate the attention he (the objector) purports, he wrote.Indeed, his argument somewhat demonstrates why the applicant requires a private chapel for private non-denominational contemplation.He said claims that the chapel would be a blot on the landscape, destroying views were not based on facts and discredit the high-quality architecture.Ed Sheeran: stories behind his tattoosHe added that it is common for Suffolk churches to be located on the edge of or outside settlements.Often, but not entirely because of the 14th century post-plague relocations of villages, this relationship is strongly characteristic of the area, he said.It is also the case that private chapels are generally sited away from their host houses for the purpose of providing a visible feature in the landscape encouraging the contemplation of the viewer.The proposed flint chapel would hold a congregation of around 24.The application states there is a need for the chapel as it is every person\u0027s right to be able to have a place of retreat for contemplation and prayer, for religious observance, celebration of key life and family milestones, marriages, christenings and so forth.A wedding licence would be needed if Sheeran planned to marry there.An expected decision date on the planning application is not available, the council\u0027s website said.Brexit bulletin: Victory for Penka the cow as she is spared from slaughter for crossing EU border Kim Jong-un poses for first \u0026#39selfie\u0026#39 as he goes on late

Through his art and high profile, he could make such a difference in encouraging his audiences to support the ban of single-use plastics.What on earth was he doing using plastic confetti canons at his gig? Especially in a county and beautiful place such as the Eden Project, who are working so hard at getting rid of single-use plastics, which as we know have devastating impacts on wildlife and environment.Get a grip Gary and use your talent in a more responsible manner.Issuing an apology, Gary Barlow said: \u0026#39Beyond the effect it just turns into litter\u0026#39Many fans enjoyed the confetti cannon during the concert,  at the Eden Project on Wednesday, June 6.One Twitter user, Lucy Burnett, wrote: Much love to the confetti guy last night.Another fan posted a picture of herself on stage putting some confetti in Barlow\u0027s hair.Others responded to Barlow\u0027s apology on Twitter with their own pictures of the confetti - saying they had attempted to take as much home as possible as a souvenir.But other social media users were less impressed.One wrote: Wonder how long it will be before it’s made it’s way to the sea. Another described it as a lack of responsibility.The Eden Project is an educational charity that promotes sustainable living and environmental protections.What do you think?

It\u0027s hard if you\u0027re being painted in the press as a liar and now she\u0027s able to say: ‘I know it\u0027s a bizarre story but it\u0027s a true one.’One of the difficulties with a psychopath and a narcissist, as Mr Herba is, is that he behaves in such a way that it\u0027s almost impossible to believe that someone could be so stupid and so, in some ways, it\u0027s not surprising that the media found Chloe\u0027s story difficult to believe.Let\u0027s not forget she was bundled into a suitcase, injected with ketamine in the boot of a car and thought she was going to die.She is over the moon, she is delighted. The Italian legal system has performed brilliantly. Chloe was worried about what he might do if he got out, so she is relieved on all fronts and now she can get on with her life. We knew that she was bona fide, we knew that her story was true and so did the Italian police and now the courts.She knew that in the end she would be found to be telling the truth. At the time she played the only card that she had which was to keep him on side until he released her.Despite fake social media profiles purporting to be Ms Ayling and claiming she had moved to Los Angeles, she is still living at home with her mother in Surrey and is trying to decide what she wants to do next, Mr Sington said.She has a book about her ordeal, named Kidnapped, due out next month.Herba claimed throughout the trial that the kidnapping was fake, a ruse dreamt up by him and Ms Ayling to make money by advancing her modeling career and landing her a role on reality TV.That was rejected outright by judges in Milan, who found him guilty of kidnapping and extortion and sentenced him to 16 years and nine months in prison.It is alleged that his brother, Michal Herba, 37, was also part of the plot. Italy is seeking his extradition from the UK, where he is in custody.During his summing up, the prosecutor in the case said that Ms Ayling could have died after being drugged with ketamine.Paolo Storari said that after the kidnap, in which Ms Ayling was zipped inside a canvas hold-all, she was handcuffed to furniture for at least the first night of her captivity.He told the court that Herba had bought two ski masks to use in the kidnapping and that he sent a note to his brother instructing him to scrub the boot of the car to make sure there were no traces of her DNA or strands of hair.In a statement to the court, Herba said he had fallen in love with the British model, from Coulsdon in Surrey, and the two had concocted the plot to make money.He said the website on which she was to have been auctioned as a sex slave, Black Death, was entirely fictitious.I never hurt the girl. I was not violent with her, Herba said. If she felt forced verbally in any way, I am very sorry. But it certainly was not as Chloe has described.I was in love and I was hoping that once her fame took off that she would repay me with feelings and we would share the money.”Katia Kolakowska, his lawyer, told the court that the kidnap plot closely resembled the plot of an American film called “By Any Means”.It was released a couple of months before the kidnapping.Chloe Ayling being interviewed upon her return to BritainIn a message to The  after the plot emerged, the film’s producers said: “We have been following the story closely and it is matching exactly the film. In the film, the girl gets kidnapped but the police question whether she is telling the truth because her story doesn’t add up.”The veracity of Ms Ayling’s account of the ordeal was questioned when it emerged that she had gone shopping for shoes with Herba during the kidnapping in the town of Viu’ in Piedmont, and had breakfast with him in a café on the day that he gave her up to the British consulate in Milan.When the Italian police asked her why she had not revealed the shopping trip to them, she began to cry.The young model said she went along on the shopping trip because by that time Herba had promised to set her free.In security camera footage shown to the court, Ms Ayling was seen holding hands with Herba while strolling through Turin.She claimed she did so because she was petrified and believed Herba when he said that they were being watched by other members of his gang.The police also asked her whether she had had sex with her captor, after they found traces of sperm on a bed in the farmhouse where she was held.She categorically denied that they had had sexual intercourse but admitted to sharing a double bed with him.“He tried to make sexual advances but I always rejected them, promising him a more intimate relationship in the future. I made him believe we could be more intimate when the whole thing ended.”Lukasz Herba\u0026#39s mugshot by the Italian policeIt also emerged that Ms Ayling had met Herba in Paris months before the alleged abduction. She went there for a fashion shoot and he presented himself as a photographer.But the shoot was cancelled after he claimed all his cameras had been stolen.After being questioned by police and allowed to return to Britain, Ms Ayling spoke to the media outside her home, saying that she had feared for her life second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour during the abduction. Herba had allegedly told her that young women who were sold as sex slaves to buyers in the Middle East were eventually discarded and “fed to the tigers” once their “owners” tired of them.Mr Pesce, the model’s Italian lawyer, said he would seek half a million euros in compensation in separate proceedings, while conceding it was unlikely that Herba would be able to pay.Brexit bulletin: Victory for Penka the cow as she is spared from slaughter for crossing EU border Kim Jong-un poses for first \u0026#39selfie\u0026#39 as he goes on late night Singapore walkabout‘Sex dungeon master’ was tricked by crooked lawyer into believing he had won £710k compensation from Channel 4, court hears US air force deserter found alive in California after 35 year manhuntWhat China, Russia and Japan are pushing for in the messy geopolitical game over North KoreaLife-saving operations halted in the Central African Republic as rebels raid hospitals and aid agenciesUK set for hotter than average summer, Met Office predicts  Britain urges UAE not to press ahead with attack on Yemen\u0026#39s \u0026#39lifeline\u0026#39 portComment: Singapore\u0026#39s success story has an obvious appeal to Kim, but it is no model for post-Brexit BritainPoldark: the true history of the Cornish bread riots NHS should offer stress counselling for those struggling with gender reassignmentUS sends junior official to open its de facto embassy in Taiwan, as it seeks to avoid Beijing\u0026#39s anger \u0026#39Feared hard man\u0026#39 ordered shooting of bouncer who ejected his son, court toldDonald Trump to tell Kim Jong-un he can stay in power - as long as he gives up nuclear weaponsGary Barlow gives up confetti cannons at outdoor shows as he is condemned for \u0026#39littering\u0026#39 the Eden ProjectSphinx row reignites between Egypt and China after replica reappearsSeizing epileptic boy\u0026#39s cannabis oil at Heathrow signed his death warrant, mother tells ministerSingapore summit between the US and North Korea: Everything you need to know about Donald Trump\u0026#39s meeting with Kim Jong-UnWho’s at the negotiating table?

The Land Rover Discovery is currently made at the company’s Solihull plant, but Jaguar said\u0026nbspthat it will switch production to eastern Europe by early next year and added that agency workers are most at risk from the move. According to union sources, workers had not been informed of the news when it leaked to the press on Monday. The company would not confirm how many roles are at risk. In April, the car maker announced plans to cut 1,000 UK jobs as a result of Brexit uncertainty and difficult trading conditions. However, at the time, the group also said it remained committed to all of its UK plants. “The decision to move the Land Rover Discovery to Slovakia and the potential losses of some agency employed staff in the UK is a tough one but forms part of our long-term manufacturing strategy as we transform our business globally,” a spokesperson for Jaguar said on Monday. As part of the move, the car maker plans to invest millions into its Solihull plant, where the new Range Rover and Range Rover Sport models will be built. “This significant investment and technology upgrade in Solihull in order to accommodate our next-generation of flagship Land Rover models, and the refit of our Halewood plant for the next Evoque, is proof that we remain committed both to the UK and to transformation and growth,” the spokesperson added.The announcement comes weeks after profits at Jaguar Land Rover were almost cut in half in the fourth quarter as the car-maker was stung by a combination of falling diesel sales, Brexit uncertainty and vehicle taxation.The group saw pre-tax profit slump to £364m in the three months to 31 March, down from £676m in the same period last year.In the UK, the company said it was impacted by consumer uncertainty surrounding diesel models, Brexit and vehicle taxation.Additional reporting by newswiresor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

City analysts had expected a 0.3 per cent expansion.It was the worst monthly performance since October 2012.The ONS added that there was “widespread weakness” in the sector, with nine of the 13 sub-sectors\u0026nbspshowing a decline.The wider industrial sector, which includes energy firms, saw an 0.8 per cent fall, following a 0.1 per cent expansion in March.Dave Ramsden, the deputy governor of the Bank of England,\u0026nbspsaid last week that recent survey data was supporting the Bank’s view that GDP growth would bounce back strongly in the second quarter.But the latest report on manufacturing, which accounts for 10 per cent of UK GDP, suggests otherwise.The pound fell sharply in the wake of the figures, dropping to $1.3373, down 0.3 per cent on the day, as traders scaled back their bets on an August interest rate hike from the Bank.Construction output was also weaker than expected according to the ONS, growing by just 0.5 per cent, following the 2.3 per cent slump in March.Rounding off a hat-trick of disappointing news, the ONS separately reported that the goods trade deficit was wider than expected in April at £14.03bn, rather than the £11.35bn City analysts had pencilled in.On a three-monthly basis, the value of goods exports, excluding erratics, was down 3.7 per cent, while imports fell 2 per cent.Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, pointed to a rise in exports on a year-on-year basis.“Far from the gloom some people report, today’s trade figures show in the year to April 2018 the trade deficit narrowed by £6.7bn as overall exports rose by 7 per cent,” he said on Monday.However, most analysts said the trade figures were not encouraging.“It is possible that the UK is now moving past the recent sweet spot for exporters, with growth in key markets moderating and the impact of the post-EU referendum slump in sterling, which has helped some exporters, subsiding. The possibility of an escalating trade war has added to the downside risks for exporters,” said Suren\u0026nbspThiru\u0026nbspof the British Chambers of Commerce.The ONS’s analysis\u0026nbspof the economy in 2018 has been at odds with the Bank of England’s, with the statistics agency identifying underlying weakness, but the Bank attributing the slowdown almost entirely to the “Beast from the East” snowstorms of February and March.The Bank held off from raising interest rates in May, saying it would wait to see if its more optimistic view would be bourne out.In the first quarter, GDP growth is estimated to have slumped to just 0.1 per cent, with manufacturing growing by 0.2 per cent, services by 0.3 per cent and constriction slumping by 2.7 per cent.“The data also make an August interest rate hike by the Bank of England look a lot more questionable.”The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated on Monday\u0026nbspthat the UK’s GDP growth rate was still only 0.2 per cent in the three months to May.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Land Rover Discovery is currently made at the company’s Solihull plant, but Jaguar said\u0026nbspthat it will switch production to eastern Europe by early next year and added that agency workers are most at risk from the move. According to union sources, workers had not been informed of the news when it leaked to the press on Monday. The company would not confirm how many roles are at risk. In April, the car maker announced plans to cut 1,000 UK jobs as a result of Brexit uncertainty and difficult trading conditions. However, at the time, the group also said it remained committed to all of its UK plants. “The decision to move the Land Rover Discovery to Slovakia and the potential losses of some agency employed staff in the UK is a tough one but forms part of our long-term manufacturing strategy as we transform our business globally,” a spokesperson for Jaguar said on Monday. As part of the move, the car maker plans to invest millions into its Solihull plant, where the new Range Rover and Range Rover Sport models will be built. “This significant investment and technology upgrade in Solihull in order to accommodate our next-generation of flagship Land Rover models, and the refit of our Halewood plant for the next Evoque, is proof that we remain committed both to the UK and to transformation and growth,” the spokesperson added.The announcement comes weeks after profits at Jaguar Land Rover were almost cut in half in the fourth quarter as the car-maker was stung by a combination of falling diesel sales, Brexit uncertainty and vehicle taxation.The group saw pre-tax profit slump to £364m in the three months to 31 March, down from £676m in the same period last year.In the UK, the company said it was impacted by consumer uncertainty surrounding diesel models, Brexit and vehicle taxation.Additional reporting by newswiresor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Andy Martin on the man who’ll be guiding ITV viewers through a month of World Cup hyperboleEverybody is a commentator these days. @Chasepacheco1, for example, who tweeted after last month’s Uefa Champions League final:\u0026nbsp“My Liverpool team fought hard and I’m proud of them. Except for Karius, he can die in a hole.” Loris Karius, Liverpool’s German goalkeeeper, let in three goals (one of them, to be fair, a moment of sheer brilliance by Gareth Bale). Which means that online he finds himself denounced as a “Nazi”. And, according to one theory, paid handsomely for his “howlers” by Real Madrid. We can assume that the World Cup in Russia this month will be the occasion of a deluge of similar wildly overheated rhetoric, hyperbole and death threats.But you won’t be hearing any of it from ITV’s chief football commentator Clive Tyldesley. Winner many times over of the Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year award, he is the voice of moderation, the calm centre at the eye of the storm. Occasionally the target of Twitter rage himself, he expects to encounter not just a lot of verbals but also racism, hooliganism, and misogyny on top. Football, he says, is “warts and all. It reflects life. It corrupts. That is part of its fascination.” But, from the heights of the commentary box, he tries to provide something like a counterpoint to all the frenzy, the agony and the ecstasy.He is a fit-looking 63 and described himself as “a respecter of vocabulary” when I went to see him shortly before the Champions League final. “I would never say it’s a ‘disaster’ or a ‘tragedy’ if the ball goes through the goalkeeper’s legs,” he said. “You only use words like that if somebody dies.” He thought he might stretch to “calamity”.\u0026nbspHis words were strangely prophetic. As it turned out that is exactly the word he selected to describe Liverpool’s “goalkeeping calamity” when Karius bowled the ball right onto the toe of Benzema. But it struck me that there was also a kind of poetry, of a restrained, austere kind, in his summary of Real Madrid’s first goal, perhaps something like an instant haiku:And Real Madrid are in front.His “an evening that had started so promisingly for Liverpool” sounded a poignantly elegiac note. I also had to admire the comment, after Karius lets a tame one by Bale slip through his hands and into the net: “His reputation would do well to survive that moment.” Note the use of the conditional tense. Tyldesley appreciates that the keeper’s reputation is already in tatters, but that – perhaps in an ideal world – it could still recover.David Hume said that you cannot get an “ought” from an “is”. Somehow Clive Tyldesley manages to pull that off. He is only describing a game of football but there is an implicit ethics in his commentary. Tyldesley agrees with Bill Shankly that football is not a matter of life and death, but omits the punchline, “it’s more important than that.” Still, it is “a huge emotional investment by all the people who turn on. They choose to watch.” Therefore, as a commentator, “You have to be careful with your use of words.”The Playstation Schools Cup U15 final, between Thomas Telford School and Carshalton Boys Sports College, held at Reading’s Madejski stadium, was as fraught and intense as any Champions League final. Some of the players even had agents already. “Maybe overdid it a bit, Hodnett,” commented Tyldesley, in his simultaneous schools broadcast, as he skyed the ball over the bar. He prepared for this game as scrupulously as he is now preparing for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and had a foolscap file in front of him containing assorted facts about the players.There was a goalmouth melee, which saw both the Carshalton goalkeeper and the Telford player red-carded. And a penalty shootout after the much fancied Telford came back from 2-0 down only to blow it on the last kick of the game. “Now that is absolutely out of order,” said Tyldesley, as the hulking No 10 wrapped a menacing paw around the referee. “He’d have done well to keep his opinions to himself.” It’s advice he has tried to follow.But in a sense all of his commentary implies an opinion. Presumably he would have disapproved of Zinedine Zidane’s farewell headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and David Beckham’s retaliation on Diego Simeone that got him sent off in 1998. Tyldesley himself doesn’t get flustered. He is unflappable. He has – and admires – grace under pressure. “His control wasn’t the best,” as he said in one of his critical remarks about the U15 final. The ability to take and keep control is all important, whether you’re on the pitch or off it.This might have something to do with having been subjected to the furious “hairdryer” treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson when still manager of Manchester United, not just once but twice. “You really can feel your hair blowing backwards.” He thought that the boot that hit David Beckham in the face in the dressing room was “probably an accident”.Whether it’s broadcasting to schools or to 10 million people on ITV, Tyldesley always feels a sense of “responsibility”. “Balance” is a key word. He points out that the dying words of Pheidippedes, the messenger who ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to report on the outcome of the battle back in 490BC, “We won!”, only caused confusion, because people were bound to ask, “Who is ‘we’?” “He wasn’t a good journalist,” says Tyldesley. “What he should have said is ‘Athens won’.” Greece 1, Persia 0.He was once commentating on an England-Scotland game with Ron Atkinson when Atkinson insisted on saying “we”. Tyldesley said to him, “You should say ‘England’ not ‘we’.” Although he accepts that there perhaps he was being “correct beyond reason”. He allows that the occasional we “might slip out” at the World Cup. “I’m English but I’m still objective. You don’t choose to support England. It would be odd to switch to supporting Chile.”Tyldesley disapproves of those who get too fancy. “A straightforward pass would have done,” is a classic line of his, which happened to be addressed to schools. So too when it comes to commentary. He argues that cricket and golf have passages of inaction which permit – or even demand – “colour”, the kind of lyrical and expansive discourse, infinitely digressive, forever associated with John Arlott and Brian Johnston in cricket or Peter Alliss in golf. Steve Bunce likewise in boxing, and I can get similarly carried away when it comes to describing surfing, perhaps because there are often long lulls between the epic and the awesome.Tyldesley is more a fan of plain speaking. He says the best ad slogan of all time is Ronseal’s “Does exactly what it says on the tin”. That’s how he thinks commentary should be. You observe, you analyse, you try not to hype it up. You keep it “succinct”. “There’s no point trying to be Wordsworth or Browning. As Barry Davis once said, “One man’s commentator is another man’s pain in the arse.”Everything is mediated and mediatised. There are no exceptions. The old Zen koan, “If a tree fell over in the forest and no one was there to witness it would you still hear it?” now has a clear answer. Yes, because it would be captured by a passing drone or on satellite TV, blazed all over Instagram, tweeted about furiously, the tree’s friends on Facebook would start a crowdfunding campaign, and it would shortly thereafter be the subject of a controversial Channel 4 documentary. Nothing happens any more without commentary. But this is and always has been especially true of football. “They think it’s all over… it is now”, Kenneth Wolstenholme’s line, is as memorable as the 1966 World Cup final itself. Whether or not the ball crossed the line is less significant now than the fact that there was so much debate about whether or not it had. And new technology is not making the debate go away, rather the opposite.I can’t play football without also hearing something like this in my head:\u0026nbsp “Martin comes on, scores with his first touch, and the crowd goes wild.” As Simon Critchley, philosopher and (currently distraught) Liverpool fan comments in his book, What We Think About When We Think About Football, “We usually know football through commentary, through largely, and hugely, inane commentary.”Tyldesley doesn’t think of it as inane. “Sometimes,” he says, “‘a game of two halves’ is exactly what it is. You can’t improve on it.” If he were to write a book about it, it would be something like the opposite of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. Hornby is all about irrational fandom, ritual, intensity of feeling. Tyldesley is more of a phlegmatic “keep calm and carry on” sort of guy. “We don’t need to see that!” he exclaimed at the sight of an overflow of emotions on the sidelines with even teachers getting hot under the collar.Albert Camus said, “I learned everything I know about morality from football.” Which is to say, when it comes to the “beautiful game”, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all on display. There are undoubtedly heroes and villains in Tyldesley’s narrative. But he does it subtly. “You try not to sound too much like a Methodist preacher,” as he puts it. When it comes to making criticism of the play – you could call it a judo throw – by Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain, that resulted in Mo Salah going off in agony with a dislocated shoulder, Tyldesley is judicious but still uncompromising in his remarks. There is “a coming together with Ramos that only he can fully explain”. As he goes up to collect the cup, Ramos is described as “not everyone’s idea of a model professional – maybe nobody’s”.There is even an implicit politics in his commentary. Tyldesley has no objection to big money in football. “It’s labour intensive, they’re entitled to be paid. You can’t do without inidual players.” But still “the collective should be stronger than the inidual”. And this is where we went so badly wrong in the Brexit campaign, and the adjacent media coverage, he argues. “We turned it into a personality competition. Instead of providing the relevant information, we focused on the impact it would have on the lives of politicians.”He says that “the most popular team in this country is not Manchester United or Liverpool, it’s England. It’s a great democracy.” And he has to be “inclusive”. He would never use the word “esoteric” for example, he says, because he doesn’t “want anyone to have to get up and look for a dictionary”.When I saw him, Tyldesley was prepping Arabic and Russian names. He says, “I will try to get it correct, but I will not make sounds we don’t make in the English language.” When identifying James Rodriguez of Chile in the past, he wanted to say “James”.\u0026nbspEventually he bowed to pressure from Twitter to say “Ham-es”, in the Spanish manner. “But later I learned that his father,\u0026nbspa 007 fan,\u0026nbsphad named him after James Bond.”\u0026nbspHe felt vindicated, because in Spanish-speaking countries it’s always James, never Ham-es, Bond.\u0026nbspHe is not, he reckons, “responsible for the teaching of Spanish” or Arabic or Russian.In an extremist, Dionysian world, Tyldesley is an Apollonian voice of reason. He holds the mirror up to football with minimum distortion, minimum fuss. Sound without the fury. A degree zero of poetry. Let’s hope he doesn’t have to repeat a line he first used of England versus Iceland in 2016, “This is the most abject failure that I can recall.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.This is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Standing in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Below, a square hole in the rock floor denotes a sacrificial spot from the time of the Dedanites. Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Deploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.And a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The trip is only Mr Davis’s second visit to the de facto EU capital this year, with progress in talks having been slow. The minister declined to speak to the press during the trip.The “backstop solution” is supposed to prevent a hard border from emerging on the island of Ireland no matter what happens. Both sides say they do not want a hard border because the open frontier is part of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to the Troubles.Mr Barnier last week said he was still studying the UK’s proposal and had not rejected it out of hand. When asked why he was doing so if it has such problems, he said: “Because I look at all British proposals in an objective manner.”The UK paper is the product of months of cabinet wrangling over how to temporarily solve the Irish border issue if it cannot be solved by a wider trade deal.\u0026nbspSeparately, the cabinet has still not decided on a single solution for the wider customs agreement between the UK and EU – with two options on the table. Both ideas, “max fac” and “customs partnership” have been rejected out of hand by Brussels.A spokesperson for the European Commission said: “We can confirm that the European Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier and the secretary of state for exiting the European Union David Davis met this morning here in Brussels where they discussed the latest state of play of the Article 50 negotiations. They touched on issues related to the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop for Ireland-Northern Ireland and the framework for the future relationship.”British officials confirmed a similar line neither side would give more details.Officials on both sides are getting ready for a European Council summit in March where member states will take stock over the state of negotiations so far.A UK Government spokesperson said: “The Prime Minster has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\u0026nbspWe are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. That position will not change. The Commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs.“All parties must recall their commitment in the Joint Report to protect the Belfast Agreement in all its parts. Michel Barnier confirmed on Friday that discussions will now continue on our proposal.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

City analysts had expected a 0.3 per cent expansion.It was the worst monthly performance since October 2012.The ONS added that there was “widespread weakness” in the sector, with nine of the 13 sub-sectors\u0026nbspshowing a decline.The wider industrial sector, which includes energy firms, saw an 0.8 per cent fall, following a 0.1 per cent expansion in March.Dave Ramsden, the deputy governor of the Bank of England,\u0026nbspsaid last week that recent survey data was supporting the Bank’s view that GDP growth would bounce back strongly in the second quarter.But the latest report on manufacturing, which accounts for 10 per cent of UK GDP, suggests otherwise.The pound fell sharply in the wake of the figures, dropping to $1.3373, down 0.3 per cent on the day, as traders scaled back their bets on an August interest rate hike from the Bank.Construction output was also weaker than expected according to the ONS, growing by just 0.5 per cent, following the 2.3 per cent slump in March.Rounding off a hat-trick of disappointing news, the ONS separately reported that the goods trade deficit was wider than expected in April at £14.03bn, rather than the £11.35bn City analysts had pencilled in.On a three-monthly basis, the value of goods exports, excluding erratics, was down 3.7 per cent, while imports fell 2 per cent.Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, pointed to a rise in exports on a year-on-year basis.“Far from the gloom some people report, today’s trade figures show in the year to April 2018 the trade deficit narrowed by £6.7bn as overall exports rose by 7 per cent,” he said on Monday.However, most analysts said the trade figures were not encouraging.“It is possible that the UK is now moving past the recent sweet spot for exporters, with growth in key markets moderating and the impact of the post-EU referendum slump in sterling, which has helped some exporters, subsiding. The possibility of an escalating trade war has added to the downside risks for exporters,” said Suren\u0026nbspThiru\u0026nbspof the British Chambers of Commerce.The ONS’s analysis\u0026nbspof the economy in 2018 has been at odds with the Bank of England’s, with the statistics agency identifying underlying weakness, but the Bank attributing the slowdown almost entirely to the “Beast from the East” snowstorms of February and March.The Bank held off from raising interest rates in May, saying it would wait to see if its more optimistic view would be bourne out.In the first quarter, GDP growth is estimated to have slumped to just 0.1 per cent, with manufacturing growing by 0.2 per cent, services by 0.3 per cent and constriction slumping by 2.7 per cent.“The data also make an August interest rate hike by the Bank of England look a lot more questionable.”The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated on Monday\u0026nbspthat the UK’s GDP growth rate was still only 0.2 per cent in the three months to May.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is not your fault. Ask Daddy!”Can you imagine how that little girl must be feeling?She’s lost her mother and some have surmised the note appears to point the finger at her dad.It’s obviously not at all clear if that was really Kate’s intention, or whether she just wanted her daughter to seek answers and comfort from her father.That’s the trouble with suicide. Those left behind have to deal with so many unanswered questions.Look at little Ariane, who has just lost her beloved dad and will also be left with feelings of confusion and anger, as well as searing grief.Anthony, 61, was an award-winning chef and TV presenter.He was in France filming an episode of his successful CNN series, Parts Unknown, when he was found unresponsive in his hotel room.He was a larger-than-life, passionate character who championed the underdog and supported his girlfriend Asia Argento, one of the first actresses to accuse Harvey Weinstein of rape.Both Kate and Anthony were successful and, as far as the rest of the world was concerned, were living the dream.But no one really knows what goes on behind closed doors.Kate, who was 55, met husband Andy 35 years ago.They were married for 24 years but had been living apart for the past ten months, while sharing parental duties.They hadn’t discussed divorce and Andy said they still loved each other very much.He went on to say there was no indication that Kate was going to kill herself and his priority now is to protect and comfort his daughter.He will not only be grieving but inevitably feel he should have been able to somehow prevent this tragedy.People have asked “Who in their right mind would leave their own child to grow up motherless?”, but that’s the point.Kate wasn’t “in her right mind” and it seems neither was Anthony.People who kill themselves are suffering mental distress that no one can understand unless they have walked a mile in their shoes.On the surface, Kate had it all. Many thought she was still happily married. The couple had a healthy daughter, her designer label was a massive success.Kate was also good looking, funny and always seemed happy in interviews and photos. But now we know the poor woman was in agony.According to members of her family she had suffered from mental health problems for many years, and there has been speculation she was reluctant to seek help.If this was the case, then the reasons put forward for Kate trying to cope on her own are heartbreaking.She was apparently worried that her business, based on her cheerful handbags, would be affected if it was known she suffered from anxiety and depression. That really is desperately sad.Not only was Kate trying to cope with her demons but her marriage was going through a rocky patch and all the while she felt as though she had to paint on a smile and pretend everything was fine.Her life became so unbearable that she believed her only escape was to end it all.Her husband has said she was undergoing treatment and taking medication, yet Kate’s death shows that despite a change in attitudes towards those unfortunate enough to suffer from mental health problems, there is still a very long way to go.There are still people who will tell sufferers who are clearly very unwell to man up, or pull themselves together, which is just about the worst thing you could do.Suicide is a growing problem and each death is a tragedy. It is the biggest killer of men aged 20 to 49 in the UK. At least 84 men will have taken their own lives this week.If so many people were being lost to a virus there would be a national outcry and funds would be made available to find the cause and cure.Mental illness is still a Cinderella disease, and that cannot continue.But there are glimmers of hope.On TV we’ve seen the effect of Aidan Connor’s suicide on his friends and family in Coronation Street. It was tough to watch but raised awareness on a massive scale.We have seen raw grief but also deep anger and Aidan was branded selfish by his distraught sister.Those closest to him have experienced guilt because they didn’t realise how much pain he was in and have suffered sleepless nights and have been torturing themselves for not knowing how bad it was and for not offering help.Corrie shone a light in a dark place and I believe this storyline and the tragedy of Kate Spade and the apparent suicide of Anthony Bourdain will make people think.None of us knows what private battles are being fought against the dark demons of mental illness, even among our family and close friends.We all need to be watchful and unafraid to ask if everything really is OK. We need to be prepared to be rebuffed but to gently persist if we feel there is a real problem.The black despair that it seems Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade succumbed to could happen to any one of us.If you feel depressed, please, I beg you, be brave and ask for help. And let’s all be prepared to reach out to that person in despair.I FIND it utterly ludicrous that in the eyes of the law a criminal who steals your pet is treated in exactly the same way as if they stole your TV or sofa.There’s no consideration for the fact that your dog or cat is a living, breathing animal and a much beloved member of the family.If the thieves are caught, although unlikely in these days of police cuts, the monetary value of the pet is the only consideration when it comes to sentencing.This is bonkers. You simply cannot put a price on your pet.So I am delighted that a campaign to change the law is gaining momentum.What all concerned dog and cat lovers want is higher sentencing for the theft of our animals and to reclassify stealing a pet as a crime in its own right.Hopefully this would act as a deterrent to pet theft, something alarmingly on the increase.One of those who passionately wants the law to change is Sir Bruce Forsyth’s daughter Debbie Matthews.Back in 2006, both her dogs were stolen from her car.She appeared on GMTV with her dad to make a heartfelt plea begging for the return of Yorkshire terriers Gizmo and Widget.Thankfully, within hours of appearing on the show, people who had bought the dogs in good faith at a market realised they were stolen from Debbie and she was emotionally reunited with them.It was a traumatic time for the whole family and Debbie knows she was incredibly lucky her story had a happy ending.So many owners never see their pets again and are left with endless worries about their fate.If you want to help change the law, do sign the pet theft petition at petition.parliament.uk/petitions/212174 and make your voice heard.IT was impossible to take the p*** out of Peter Stringfellow, because he would be first to make fun of himself.He knew his habit of wearing tiny thongs made him look daft, and was well aware that his mullet haircut was old-fashioned and silly and that people considered him to be a bit naff.When he was pilloried, he just gave one of his big guffaws and carried on enjoying himself.Peter was funny, kind-hearted and generous to a fault.He bore his illness with great stoicism and bravery and will be sadly missed.POLDARK returns to our screens tomorrow night amid a row over what many in Scotland refer to as “taps aff”.This occurs on those wonderful, albeit rare, occasions when the sunshine beams warmly north of the border and allows chaps to remove their cagoules, sweatshirts, woolly jumpers and tops.Aidan Turner, who plays Captain Poldark, is probably one of the most famous exponents of “taps aff” in recent times, ever since those sweaty scything scenes in his first series.It turns out that it was Aidan’s idea to take off his cambric shirt and scythe away in those tight breeches.But it’s caused the mother of all rows, with admiring women being accused of “objectifying” the bold captain.I have thoughtfully reproduced an image of a topless Aidan so you can make up your own minds.You will either think this photograph adds to the joy of a Saturday or be horrified by the sexualisation of the poor, unfortunate man.Frankly, I’m happy to wallow in this fantastic view and look forward to tomorrow, BBC1, 9pm, when I can enjoy some cracking writing, proper acting and top production values.Those “taps aff” scenes only enhance the pleasure of Poldark and, don’t forget, no one forced Aidan to show his pert nipples.He knows full well he’s a handsome fella and it was all his choice, for which we are truly grateful.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I believe the horrifying murder of soldier Lee Rigby in May 2013 was a turning point.As the founder of Tell MAMA, I found myself in the unenviable position of having to mobilise my tiny team at the time to help the growing number of people being targeted at a street and online level by anti-Muslim hatred.The backlash was significant, given the targeting of a young soldier minding his own business and the brutal manner of the terrorist attack.In the aftermath, Ukrainian neo-Nazi Pavlo Lapshyn placed three bombs in mosques in Wolverhampton, Walsall and Tipton — two months after murdering Mohammed Saleem, a grandfather walking back home from his mosque in Birmingham.The past five years have seen no let-up in the UK.People acting alone and small insular cells of men, and increasingly women, have carried out attacks at London Bridge, in Manchester, Finsbury Park and Westminster Bridge.And let us not ­forget the multiple terrorist attacks on 7/7 and the attempted attacks on civilians on 21/7.Our country has had its fair share of local and national triggers for potential tensions, but the unique nature of British society has meant we have not seen riots on our streets, such as those in Oldham in 2001 — and this is something to be ­celebrated.Terrorist trigger points have clearly led to rises in anti-Muslim hate incidents and there have been points where our country has been under ­significant pressure.After 7/7 and the significant loss of life that took place then, Britain was on a heightened state of alert as another plot failed to deliver its deadly cargo and the police and security services were in a race to find members of that terror cell.Dubbed 21/7, the country was shaken, ­communities were fearful and there was a crackle in the air as some people aired their frustrations openly.Even after all of this, we as communities held together.There is therefore something unique in our country which means community violence has not broken out, whereas in other European ­countries there have been street clashes and the widespread intimidation of minority communities.That “uniqueness” in our country is based on the old tradition that is ingrained in our society — that of “live and let live”, and “fair play”.It also underscores that the space for the accommodation of ideas and new populations has been a fundamental and historic part of our country though today, with resource pressures, there are limits.However, this is not only one-way traffic, and a sense of pride and identity within groups such as Britain’s Muslims has shown itself time and time again.It is therefore important to note that while ­younger citizens are less proud to be English, poll after poll has shown that Muslims living here are more ­patriotic than the average Brit.This means many Muslims do feel pride in a country where they can worship freely, be who they want to be and have the ability to practice their faith how they want to.We also have to say what is patently obvious, that Muslims have more freedoms in the United Kingdom compared to their counterparts in ­mainland Europe, where veil bans, harassment and chronic unemployment blight Muslim and other minority communities.It is this freedom to worship without fear, allied to the British sense of fair play, that makes us a place many countries look up to.The fact is our futures are inter-related and will continue to be as people travel more and ­connect through social media.It also means many of our preconceptions of different communities will change over time.This can be a force for good, though hand-in-hand with this must be that there are a unique set of values in our country.They have held us together in the darkest moments and have strengthened our resolve to stand together. Of this, we can always be proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hewill demand Britain continues to accept freedom of movement in exchange for unfettered access to Europe’s single market. But the Migration Watch think tank warned Mrs May that failure to curb EU migration after Brexit would destroy the Tory party’s credibility with voters.Its boss Lord Green said: “Controlling our borders must mean reducing immigration or it is pointless. 62% want to see a reduction in low skilled migration while 80% of EU migrants over the last ten years have been lower skilled. So any new arrangements must involve a sharp cut in immigration from the EU or the credibility of the Conservative government will be in shreds.”And Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the powerful backbench European Research Group of Tory MPs, said the ambush would only backfire on the EU. He told The Sun: “If Brussels wants to do that it fails to realise why we voted to leave in the first place - it’s all about taking back control.“Clever ambushes are are yesterday’s story for the European Commission and they need to stop thinking along those lines. Their failure to do so is why Italy is unhappy, Hungary and so on. It’s a mindset that is actually turning nations against the European Union.”Meanwhile on Wednesday Home Secretary Sajid Javid is expected to announce the Government’s plans for the status of EU migrants already living in the UK. He has torn up plans by his predecessor Amber Rudd to offer preferential treatment to EU citizens after Brexit.Yesterday Labour frontbencher Andy McDonald said immigration could actually go up after Brexit. The shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said if businesses wanted more people to be allowed into Britain then the Government should allow that. His comments were described by one Tory MP as a “kick in the teeth for Brexit voters”.And his shadow cabinet colleague Sir Keir Starmer also hinted Labour is getting ready to U-turn on their pledge to end free movement.

The whole thing is keeping Theresa May so busy that she hasnt even had time to check in to this years Love Island villa at all.As the EU Withdrawal Bill returns to the House of Commons for a series of knife-edge votes this week, weve got some help for the Love Island ladies to understand whats really going on in our fight to quit the EU...In short, Hayley, Britain is leaving the European Union.In a historic vote in 2016 Brits voted to throw off the shackles of Brussels and go it alone, taking back control of our money, borders and laws.We officially kicked off the process in March 2017, and Theresa May now has less than a year to negotiate with the EU just how were going to leave, and whats happening next.But, to be honest, its not going all that well for her lately.Last week her Brexit secretary David Davis almost quit over controversial plans for Northern Ireland, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson started mouthing off about the Government at a private dinner and he even said that Donald Trump could get a better deal with the EU.Not ideal. Mrs May needs the next few days to go a bit smoother or she will face more calls to kick her out and replace her with someone new.The EU Withdrawal Bill is absolutely vital to make sure Britain is ready for Brexit.It will transfer all existing EU laws into British law, so there are no gaps after we finally quit the bloc.In essence, its proof to the European Union that we really are leaving and were getting on with it.So come on, lets start talking trade!And if Brussels think the PM is being dictated to by her own MPs it will make Britain look weak at the negotiating table, where were fighting for a decent trade deal.Theresa May needs to win to show shes under control.We must be in a strong position to get what we want - and these votes could bind the PMs hands completely.So far its gone through the House of Commons and passed through to the Lords with just one change to it.Now meddling peers have slapped on a whopping 15 changes to it, which if passed would tell Mrs May what to do in Brussels.These have nothing to do with the EU Bill itself - all this is about is putting EU laws into Britains books.Lords - many of whom voted to Remain - want to water the Bill down and change it to how they want.And if they could, many of them would opt to keep us in the EU after all.Peers in the upper chamber have changed Mrs Mays Bill several times which is causing her huge problems.The main one is on the customs union - which would force the Government to negotiate with the EU to keep Britain in the customs union after Brexit.That would help trade flow freely between the EU and the UK - but would also stop Britain striking new trade deals with the rest of the world, removing one of Brexit’s main advantages.Although it would not necessarily keep the UK in the customs union, it would make that outcome much more likely.Theres a chance this one could pass, leaving Mrs May weak and defeated.Perhaps the most damaging amendment for the Government’s Brexit plan is a motion to propel Britain into the European Economic Area.The EEA - which includes Norway and Iceland - incorporates the single market, so joining it would force us to continue free movement of people and keep most European laws. That wont fly with most Leavers.Some of the other changes include scrapping Brexit Day altogether (when we will finally exit the bloc), hanging on to EU rights, keeping our borders open to refugees and giving MPs the power to decide what happens if they vote down her final Brexit deal.The Government has also accepted several amendments to the Bill - including that the courts should refer to European Court of Justice judgements when relevant and clarifying the status of retained EU laws after exit dayThe Bill comes back for two days to the House of Commons tomorrow and Wednesday.They are set to have six hours to debate the changes and then vote on whether to accept or reject them.By tomorrow night well know whether these changes have been made.Most of them Mrs May is set to win - as they do have a majority in the House of Commons with the help of her coalition pals - the DUP.Their 10 MPs - who have promised to support her - will secure the votes needed for most of them to pass.But some Tory rebels are threatening to go to the other side and vote against her on some of the changes - like the ones on a vote on our Brexit deal, and the customs union plans.These ones are likely to be much, much closer, and will cause real problems if they are lost.The Government has already put down a number of concessions to plead with the MPs to come back onside, but will it work? Who knows.At the end of last year 11 Tories voted against the PM and issued a damning defeat on her.Its likely the same group could cause trouble again.They include leading Remainers Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, who all want the PM to compromise more.But leading rebel Ken Clarke yesterday admitted that the threat of rebellions was melting away because Tory MPs feared that inflicting government defeats this week would topple Mrs May after the turbulence of last week.Gosh, if only it were that easy.Some of these MPs are incredibly stubborn and think the changes to the Brexit Bill are more important than voting with their own leader and respecting the result of the referendum.Tonight the PM will issue a rallying cry to all Tory MPs to show the public they will deliver on Brexit ahead of the crunch votes tomorrow.She will make a crucial address to a meeting of all 316 Tory MPs in a last ditch bid to stave off a damaging rebellion over the Government’s Brexit plans.Yes, Brexit is still happening, no matter what happens at the end of these votes.

And probably lucky I didnt have my kids with me too.” She thought that the locks may have been introduced as a way to stop drunk youths from vandalising the bathrooms late at night but still described it as a “bit of an overkill”.“Why cant the doors be unlocked until a later time like 8pm or something to allow easy access to the bathrooms for kids, pregnant ladies and disabled or elderly people?” Ms McDonald wrote.A couple of weeks earlier another woman, Jo Anne, took to Facebook to complain about the toilet policy claiming her child had an “accident” because of the coded locks.  “Today my child has an accident because you lock the toilets and only put the code on the receipt,” she said.“They WERE customers who were using your facility and had decided (like plenty of other parents) to have a play in the playground before ordering their afternoon ice cream treat.”She added that the store “failed” to meet the standard expected of McDonald’s restaurants.A McDonald’s spokesperson responded to Jo Anne’s criticism saying they would raise the concerns with the Maroochydore location.A spokeswoman for the chain told theABC it is not policy to lock bathroom doors but it was the decision of the store.“The local licensee has made this decision, however, they are able to be opened for anyone who requires them,” she said.A version of this article was originally published on news.au."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004100417457.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"1960","title":"kim jong un intelligence files school boy switzerland","story":"The analysis carried out for America and South Korea paints a picture of a young Kim which bears striking similarities with his 36-year-old self.A source who spoke to new-site Axios said: “The picture that emerged from literally dozens of interviews bears a striking similarity with the man he has emerged into today,“Gluttonous, prone to fits of anger and swaggering around his classmates. “Kim Jong-un was an [inattentive] student but demanded slavish loyalty from other children in his wake.”The findings came about after compiling and analysing numerous interviews with teachers, students and others who knew him at his prestigious Liebefeld-Steinhölzli public school in Koeniz, south of Bern.Kim attended from the age of 11 in 1994 and stayed there until 1997.The source even alleged young Kim was something of a hooligan who “frequently” hit other students, didn’t do well in school and was often distracted.But chillingly after games the North Korean would reportedly declare: “Someday you will all remember me.”The alleged revelations comes as the two leaders, both who have very strong personalities, meet in Singapore in a bid to avert war breaking in the Korean peninsula over Kim’s nuclear missile programme.

Wonsan is one of several special economic zones in North Korea. It\u0027s a model similar to the one pioneered by China when it opened up in the late 1970s. In theory, there are several benefits.\"North Korea could conduct special policies and give all kinds of privileges to foreign companies to do business in that area,\" Prof Cheng said.\"Also, the special economic zones could help isolate this area from the other part of North Korea so North Korea could go ahead with some special arrangement with foreign economies.\"But reality - and North Korea\u0027s pursuit of the nuclear part of the Byungjin line - got in the way of the plan. \"You see in the past years North Korea has set up more than 20 special economic areas but they\u0027ve basically failed because of international sanctions - foreign companies aren\u0027t allowed to invest in the country.\"That\u0027s what Mr Kim wants from the summit: not economic aid from the US (North Korean statements have been scathing about that idea) but the opportunity to attract foreign investment. That requires sanctions being lifted.Dandong is a Chinese city on the China-North Korea border on the other side of the Yalu River is Sinuiju, another North Korean special economic zone.

We visited the main fish market, which used to stock plenty of North Korean seafood. Sanctions imposed in 2017 put an end to that, although China is said to have relaxed the ban recently. We were offered North Korean clams, which are prized for their sweetness.Residents are optimistic about the US-North Korean summit - and what it means for their wealth.

And the economy and trade between the two countries will develop better too.\"And Dandong\u0027s economy will develop better too.\"None of that comes without risk, though - not least for Mr Kim himself, both internationally and domestically.Prof Cheng said: \"This time, when North Korea tried to change its gears, to single mindedly focus on economic development - such changes met resistance from other North Korean elites.\"Recently Kim Jong Un sacked three military guys - and that\u0027s the indication it\u0027s not easy for North Korea to change its policy in very dramatic ways.\" Mr Kim\u0027s nuclear arsenal might appear to give him a position of strength but the reality is more precarious.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt unveiled a shake-up today after a backlash over the treatment of paediatrician Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba.  She was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter over the death at of six-year-old Jack Adcock after he developed sepsis in 2011.  A tribunal ruled Dr Bawa-Garba, who was working at Leicester Royal Infirmary at the time, should remain on the medical register despite her conviction. But in January the General Medical Council (GMC) had her struck off after taking the case to the High Court.  The GMC\u0027s actions angered campaigning doctors, who said issues like dangerous understaffing, IT failures and inappropriate work conditions were ignored. Now Mr Hunt has announced he has accepted the main findings of a review into the use of gross negligence manslaughter in the NHS. The review, by eminent surgeon Professor Sir Norman Williams, was launched amid fears the fear of criminal proceedings was having a chilling effect. Tory minister Mr Hunt said: When something goes tragically wrong in healthcare, the best apology to grieving families is to guarantee that no-one will experience that same heartache again. I was deeply concerned about the unintended chilling effect on clinicians\u0027 ability to learn from mistakes following recent court rulings. And the actions from this authoritative review will help us promise them that the NHS will support them to learn, rather than seek to blame.  Sir Norman\u0027s report calls for a clearer understanding of when proceedings for gross negligence manslaughter should be brought in healthcare. Medics should be reassured they would apply only in cases of very poor performance and not honest mistakes, the report says. While accepting the findings, Mr Hunt has sought to reassure patients and their families that there will be improved scrutiny of deaths in the NHS, with the roll-out of a system of medical examiners - senior doctors who will look at all patient deaths which are not referred to a coroner. Official said the changes would mean bereaved families would get more information about the circumstances of their loved ones\u0027 deaths while more data would be shared across the NHS to help prevent avoidable deaths.

I did not mean that, my mistake, so I apologise for that.  North Korean media today hailed a new era and Trump tweeted there was excitement in the air! in a heady build-up to the summit in Singapore. The US President is expected to be alone in a room with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un for up to two hours when they meet from 2am UK time on Tuesday. Only translators will be present for the meeting at a luxury Singapore resort, a US official said - suggesting there will be no aides or note-takers, a highly unusual move. Officials could then drop in for a further hour but they admitted: We will not be surprised by any scenario.  Trump himself has said he could make a decision in the first minute or spur of the moment - raising the possibility he could make a commitment with no aides or note-takers present.

The backstop is designed to give both sides a \u0027backup plan\u0027 for customs if there is no deal to avoid a hard border by December 2020. The EU has a customs union. This means all 28 member states can trade with each other without any checks or duties on goods. Theresa May has said Britain will leave this after December 2020, so she can sign trade deals with non-EU countries. But officials have warned a new UK customs system won\u0027t be ready in time. So they\u0027ve devised a \u0027backstop\u0027 - a backup plan that will carry on some EU customs rules in the UK if there\u0027s no deal. It is designed to stop ports grinding to a halt and Northern Ireland setting up border posts, which could lead to violence. Yet Brexiteers were furious because it had no set end date. In a huge Tory row, they warned it would trap Britain half-in, half-out the EU. After frantic last-minute talks, and threats to quit by Brexit Secretary David Davis, a time limit was put in - December 2021. Yet the government only expects to follow that time limit. It is not legally binding. And the EU poured cold water on it. Britain and the EU also disagree about what the backstop will do. EU plans back in March would have kept Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels customs rules, but Theresa May rejected this because it draws a border between the province and the mainland. So she drew up Britain\u0027s own backstop, which is now being put to the EU for discussion. The UK plan is a temporary customs arrangement allowing totally tariff-free trade between the EU and the whole of the UK. So the UK would carry on being in the EU Customs Union in all but name until December 2021. But the UK also wants to sign new trade deals with nations outside the EU. Britain even wants to implement parts of these deals that don\u0027t relate to the backstop. Brussels has repeatedly said this won\u0027t be possible - so the new plan is setting up for a big battle with the EU. And as time ticks on, the backstop will become less of a Plan B and more of a Plan A. It\u0027ll turn from backstop... to frontstop. EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had already issued a withering verdict on Mrs May\u0027s proposal last week. Now today\u0027s statement, issued hours after Barnier met UK Brexit Secretary David Davis, goes further by explicitly saying it would create a hard border. The EU\u0027s negotiating team released a presentation which said Theresa May\u0027s so-called backstop leaves key questions unanswered.  Their verdict clearly seems to back Michel Barnier\u0027s original proposal, which Theresa May dismissed in February, and reject Westminster\u0027s latest effort. The chief EU negotiator\u0027s solution would see Northern Ireland remain part of the customs union, effectively creating a hard border down the Irish Sea which both the Tories and the DUP refuse to accept. However the EU would support this option describing it as a timely and workable solution. Officials claim it covers all necessary customs and regulatory controls to avoid a hard border and addresses the specific circumstances on the island of Ireland without pre-determining the future EU-UK relationship. The EU Commission insists the update leaves room for further discussion with our UK counterparts.  The UK government questions the need for any border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. But EU negotiators fear Britain could exploit a back door into its single market for goods - just at the time it\u0027s getting rid of EU rules and customs regulations.  The blow today came as Mrs May makes a plea to Tory rebels ahead of a string of crunch Brexit votes in the House of Commons . One area where Britain and the EU are still split is Brussels\u0027 Galileo space programme - after Eurocrats threatened to cut the UK out. Tory Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson today lashed out at the EU\u0027s unusual and strange attempt to exclude Britain on security grounds.  He told MPs: What we are seeing with the Galileo project is frankly the European Union acting in a most unusual and strange way. Why on earth would they wish to exclude Great Britain from such an integral project for the security of the whole of the European Union and so many others? As Britain is the largest spender on defence in the European Union currently, you\u0027d be thinking they\u0027d be welcoming us into that and hoping that we\u0027d be continuing to support it. If they don\u0027t want us, we can do it independently. The UK has already made clear it will seek a refund of the \u0026pound1billion it has already invested in the project - a rival to GPS - if it withdraws from it. Meanwhile Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the chance of a damaging no-deal Brexit was rising.

The family went to watch Prince William play in the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy at Beaufort Polo Club in Gloucestershire - and it looks like they had a brilliant day. There are lots of pictures of adorable Prince George and Princess Charlotte running around, rolling in the grass and playing just like normal kids. Royal fans particularly loved one photo of Kate, dressed in a blue \u0026pound39 Zara dress, running across the pitch. But a closer look shows she\u0027s not actually running to meet Wills, but she\u0027s actually rushing to see one of his pals.  Malcolm Borwick played alongside the prince for the charity match, and he\u0027s been good friends with William and Harry for a long time. Kate was then spotted giving Malcolm a kiss on the cheek and a hug.  Malcolm was standing outside a marquee with some of the other players and supporters when Kate ran over. He looked very happy to see her and Princess Charlotte and had a huge smile on his face.  Prince George showed of his impressive artistic skills during the event, and was proudly walking around with a lovely picture of a volcano. However he\u0027s also sparked a huge debate after being spotted playing with a toy gun. Princess Charlotte could be seen running around wearing an adorable patterned dress and sunglasses. It appears the littlest Cambridge Prince Louis stayed at home for the day.

Charlotte Caldwell\u0027s 12-year-old son Billy suffers up to 100 epileptic fits a day. The pair had travelled to Toronto on Thursday to get a six-month supply of cannabis oil to help treat his symptoms but the oil was confiscated by border officials when they tried to re-enter Britain. Ms Caldwell, from Northern Ireland, is scheduled to meet with Home Office Minister Nick Hurd about her son\u0027s medication needs on Monday.  It\u0027s Billy\u0027s anti-epileptic medication that Nick Hurd has taken away, it\u0027s not some sort of joint full of recreational cannabis, she told a press conference. I will just go back to Canada and get more and I will bring it back again because my son has a right to have his anti-epileptic medication in his country, in his own home. Let me tell you something now: we will not stop, we are not going to stop, we are not going to give up, we have love, hope, faith for our kids and we are going to continue. She said Billy was due his next dose at 3.30pm, and warned of the dangers of missing his first treatment in 19 months. The reason they don\u0027t do it is that it can cause really bad side-effects - they wean them down slowly. So what Nick Hurd has just done is most likely signed my son\u0027s death warrant.  She said she would be meeting Mr Hurd at the Home Office on Monday afternoon to plead to him parent to parent to get the oil back. Ms Caldwell, 50, said she was absolutely devastated to have the supply taken away after declaring it to border officials, and claimed one welled up with tears while doing it. They are parents themselves and they were very conflicted about removing the medication from me in fact. one of them had tears in their eyes when he was doing it. They did not want to do it, she said.

The future king was with his sister Princess Charlotte and mum Kate as they watched his dad, the Duke of Cambridge, take part in a polo match.  The four-year-old royal was seen looking down the barrel of the toy as he and other youngsters played with fake weapons and handcuffs during the family day out. At one point George, who has shown an interest in the police, even seemed to jokingly tease his mum by pointing the gun at her chin.  It is understood that George\u0027s toy was a water pistol that wasn\u0027t purchased for the young prince. It was won as a prize at a children\u0027s fair at Sunday\u0027s Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy match. The images sparked a debate on Twitter with anger and disappointment expressed by some, and others saying it was simply a case of \u0027kids being kids\u0027 that wasn\u0027t a big deal. But critics have said fake weapons shouldn\u0027t be seen as fun toys, and George and the other children shouldn\u0027t have been allowed to play with them.    The young prince did play with other toys, including a colourful \u0027slinky\u0027. Some critics argued that the toy guns - dark in colour with an orange plastic ring around the end of the barrel - looked too much like the real thing. One Twitter user wrote: Sad to see George playing with a gun when the whole country has a gun/knife crime situation. Maybe in training for killing wild life in later years. Thought he was a sensitive child. Better if he was seen playing with a toy car or football. Sadly the royals will never change.  This year has seen a surge in violent crime in London, with the Met Police launching at least 74 murder investigations so far. Another tweeted: This isn’t okay anymore... My American side here, biased maybe b/c of everyday #gunviolence in USA, but my British side agrees. No child in this day and age should look at any gun as a fun toy. This looks far too real. (And I LOVE Prince George, don’t get me wrong!). And one wrote: Here’s why the sight of Prince George playing with a toy gun is triggering for some of us. Black mothers in the US have to teach their sons not to play with anything (a toy gun, a cell phone, etc.) a policeman could claim looked like a real gun. Their lives depend on it.  Other Twitter users\u0027 came to George\u0027s defence following the polo event at Beaufort Polo Club, Gloucestershire. One wrote: Can’t believe people are booting off about Prince George playing with a toy gun and handcuffs! He’s a child most likely playing cops and robbers! People are so dramatic. Another added: Prince George was playing with a toy gun? So what! It’s a toy! People get over yourselves and let others parent how they see fit as long as they’re not causing harm or anguish to their kids. Some pointed to the fact that George comes from a family with a military and hunting background.

He seemed to have a sad look on his face as his doting mum took him into a loving embrace, tenderly stroking his cheek with a concerned look on her face.    It comes just one day after the Trooping the Colour celebrations, where sassy Savannah, seven, hilariously put her hand over George\u0027s mouth to shush him during the National Anthem.

It was held as part of a series of charitable polo matches that Prince Harry and Prince William will play in this summer, to raise money for the Royal Marsden and Centrepoint. The little prince, who is shy and reserved, held a mini mallet as he played in the grass, mimicking his dad, William, who was taking part. He kicked off his shoes and even guided his big cousin, seemingly showing her how it\u0027s done.

The paramedic has told how he spotted the youngsters sweating away inside a sealed parked car as temperatures hit 27C. Fearing for their safety, he noted the registration and went inside the store in Lydney, Gloucestershire, to alert the driver. But he claimed he was told by a security guard that the information could not be used because of data protection. Tesco has told him it will investigate the incident. The paramedic returned to the car and was about to call police to tell them he was going to break in to save life when the children\u0027s mother returned.

He wrote: “My wife, daughter and I popped in for a few bits following a day out. “We parked in one of the parent and child spaces and immediately noticed the black car next to us with two unattended young children in it, sweating away. “The thermometer in our silver car read 27C so I can’t imagine how hot they must have been sealed in that black car.  He added: I immediately went to a member of staff who was in the car park, he took the registration and went to do an announcement for the parent. “We also mentioned it to the security guard. Very worryingly his response was, ‘Oh we can’t do anything about that for data protection reasons\u0027. “He then stopped the other member of staff from taking any action. He then said he would look into it. “I was waiting for an announcement to come out whilst we did our shopping, but nothing ever came.  He wrote: “It turns out the security guard chose to ignore the situation and decided to make no attempt to help the children. “This is incredibly dangerous, the mother should be ashamed of herself but so should the Tesco security guard.

Esther Taylor, who watched her mum battle the disease, has a gene mutation meaning she is at high risk. She underwent the gruelling nine-hour double mastectomy on March 2 in a preventative operation to beat the scourge of cancer which has haunted her family. Now, Esther believes she can look with optimism to a healthy future despite many thinking she was “too young” to make such a major decision.  The paediatric nurse from Preston, Lancs., has been offered support from Liberty X pop star Michelle Heaton, who also underwent the procedure. Speaking about the thought process behind the operation, the now 25-year-old said: “It was a difficult decision, it is scary, it is painful, it is risky and it is emotional, but ultimately it is brave, it is beautiful and it is life changing. “A lot of people I have told think I’m ‘too young’ to make this sort of decision, but if you knew you were living with a high risk of developing breast cancer and you had a choice to significantly reduce the risk, then why wouldn’t you?”  Blood tests had previously revealed Esther had a rogue unidentified gene, putting her at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer. It follows several members of her family being diagnosed with cancer including aunties, uncles and her mum Patsy Fenning, who was struck down in her 40s. Esther said: “My mum comes from a big family, I have sadly lost many members of my family to cancer and the majority of aunts and uncles that are still alive have suffered cancer, too.  “It suddenly hit me, there came a time when a cancer diagnosis in the family no longer shocked me. “I think at that point I realised it was a complete injustice to all these family members dying if I didn’t do something about it. “Ultimately, I didn’t want the deaths of those so close to me to be for nothing. I wanted to celebrate them with life.  Having had to watch, care and endure her own mum Patsy’s suffering when she was just eight years old, Esther, says the ‘C’ word was never far from her mind. Esther’s surgery, a nine-hour operation, took place on March 2 at Wythenshawe Hospital. Prior to the op, she had a ‘Bye Bye Boob’ party with colleagues from Royal Blackburn Hospital at a friend\u0027s house.  She admits, while the scars of the surgery are healing, emotionally and mentally she still has a way to go with further big decisions to face at a later date and taking confidence in a look that she still finds a little ‘alien\u0027. She added: “I went for a very like-for-like look, same size boobs and shape. “This for me was never a ‘boob job’ or a cosmetic decision. These aren’t my boobs.

Between April and November last year, she used its website to order goods - mainly clothing - and claimed refunds for a large amount of items, despite not sending them back.

Cody Runyon was swimming in a community pool in Rochester, Minnesota when he saw another boy passed out at the bottom of the pool. In the clip, Cody dives into the water before he emerges with another child and tries to carry him to the side of the pool. Another boy then helps him and they get him up onto the side of the pool where a woman called Desiree Pasko starts performing CPR on the boy.  There was no lifeguard on duty. Speaking about the incident, Cody said: “I went underwater, and all of a sudden, I see him just laying on the ground just sitting down in five feet, just passed out. “I grabbed him like that around the waist, and then his head was over my shoulder and I started carrying him.” Desiree Pasko said she initially thought the drowned boy was playing a prank before quickly performing CPR. She said: Adrenaline was so surreal at the time.  I pulled him out and initiated CPR … I could hear a small gurgle and his cheeks got pink. When his cheeks turned pink, I gave one more breath, I did two more big pumps, and then I tipped him over just praying that he would vomit and he did. I started screaming, \u0027He\u0027s alive!\u0027 He\u0027s alive! Paramedics arrived at the scene shortly afterwards and continued to treat the child.

Ed Booker, 37, took part in the sinister ritual to rid a home of evil spirits - but he never realised the horrifying consequences it would have on his life. He claims his health rapidly went downhill and unexplainable things started happening after he participated in the paranormal cleansing. He says \u0027DIE\u0027 was scrawled on the inside of his windows and he even snapped an image showing the menacing circus worker lurking down a darkened corridor.  The final straw for his girlfriend Donna Hall, 31, came when she was attacked and pinned down by a macabre force at their home in Worthing, West Sussex, Ed claims. He said: “This ghost is ruining my life. My ex was attacked and pinned down. I’ve had mediums come in and they’ve been attacked too. “I’ve woken up with painful scratches down my arm. I feel like I’m in real danger.  “It has destroyed my relationship, my health is still suffering quite a lot. “I’m always depressed once I get out of the house I perk up but my mood drops as soon as I go back in. “I don’t know why it seems to want me. People have said it’s not the flat that’s evil, it’s you - it’s attached itself to you.” Ed has always been interested in the supernatural, and he has also taken part in several exorcisms as part of a ghost-hunting group.  The dark tale started when he and a team of paranormal investigators were called to rid a family home of dark forces, which had been tormenting the teenage son and his friends in Horsham, West Sussex. The events of that night were recently chronicled in Channel 4 docudrama True Horror. Ed said: “We didn’t like it as soon as we walked through the front door. Even the sceptics in the group didn’t want to go in. “When it came to do the clearing it just felt wrong. There were a lot of spirits there, all very negative.  “Then this figure came up in the middle of us - I can only describe it as a circus ringmaster, dressed all in black with a big top hat and a shovel on its shoulder. “It was just staring at us with a grin full of dirty, broken teeth. “It was an awful experience really. You never dream of something like this happening but it is real and it can happen.” In the following days, Ed - who takes tour groups around haunted buildings - said friends began seeing a tall, shadowy figure in the background. Ed even snapped some images claiming they show the ghost he claims is ruining his life.

Polish national Lukasz Herba was today sentenced to 16 years and nine months\u0027 imprisonment after an Italian court convicted him of kidnapping Chloe Ayling.  Adrian Sington, who represents Ms Ayling, said: This has been an incredible burden on her shoulders for the last year in the face of media criticism of her motivation and this is vindication - her story is true. It\u0027s hard if you\u0027re being painted in the press as a liar and now she\u0027s able to be able to say, \u0027I know it\u0027s a bizarre story but it\u0027s a true one\u0027.  One of the difficulties with a psychopath and a narcissist, as Mr Herba is, is that he behaves in such a way that it\u0027s almost impossible to believe that someone could be so stupid and so, in some ways, it\u0027s not surprising that the media found Chloe\u0027s story difficult to believe. Let\u0027s not forget she was bundled into a suitcase, injected with ketamine in the boot of a car and thought she was going to die. Ms Ayling, 20, from Coulsdon, south London, had said she was taken against her will in Milan last summer after believing she was attending a photo shoot. During the trial, police said Ayling had been drugged, handcuffed and transported in a suitcase.  Ayling’s lawyer, Francesco Pesce, said the model had suffered mental and physical abuse during the six-day ordeal. Herba, 30, claimed Ayling had agreed to the scheme to boost her career. The mum-of-one stirred further controversy when she posted a topless picture online hours after an Italian court heard she was pictured holding hands with her kidnapper. Ayling put the photo on her Instagram, showing her clutching a duvet in a risque snap.  The court heard how images appeared to show her and Herba strolling through the streets of Turin together.  He was also said to have demanded 50,000 Bitcoins for her release.  Ayling said she was drugged and bundled into a car by Herba, and only released days later after going clothes shopping. There has been speculation the kidnap was a publicity stunt.  Pictures were shown to the Italian court as jurors were also told that the pair had been in touch on Facebook since 2015.

The North Korean dictator is due to meet US president Donald Trump tomorrow at 2am UK time in what is set to be a historic meeting between the world leaders.  Jong-un arrived in an Air China plane at Cangi Airport on Sunday night in an attempt to trick a would-be assasin.  The other two planes, one of which was Kim\u0027s outdated Soviet-era Ilyushin-62 - known as Air Force Un - also flew to Singapore.  These planes contained items to keep him safe including his own food supply and a portable toilet that will deny determined sewer divers insights into to the supreme leader\u0027s stools, reports the Korean news site Chosun Ilbo .   After he walked down the red carpeted steps from the aircraft, he got into a black Mercedes stretch limo and his bodyguards ran alongside the car to his hotel. Footage showed the bodyguards, dressed in black suits, running alongside his car as part of convoy of vehicles which included an ambulance in case of any assassination attempts. Trump arrived five hours after Kim in Air Force One, after jetting in from Canada where he attended the G7 summit.  Before boarding his plane, Trump said he viewed the trip as a peace mission and will know within the first minute of meeting Kim whether they can strike a deal. The summit will take place at the Capella hotel on Sentosa, a resort island off Singapore\u0027s port with luxury hotels, a Universal Studios theme park and man-made beaches. What do the two sides want? Trump wants North Korea to ditch its nuclear weapons, which Kim threatened to use in strikes on the US mainland. North Korea wants its own security guaranteed and sanctions lifted. Why does North Korea worry about its security? The 1950s conflict between North Korea and the US-backed South ended without a peace treaty, so America and North Korea are technically still at war. Kim, sees the US, with its 30,000 troops in South Korea, as a threat, and the US campaigns in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya reinforced his view that nuclear weapons are necessary to deter a US intervention. What might be the result of talks? In exchange for economic assistance and security guarantees, North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons. Is accepting North Korea as a nuclear-armed state an option? Some analysts have suggested it is the best way to ease tensions, but doing so could lead South Korea, Japan and even Taiwan to seek their own nuclear arms. Is “denuclearisation” actually feasible? North Korea has talked about denuclearisation for years, but it has not stopped them beefing up their nuclear arsenal and conducting missile tests. What will happen if the summit fails? South Korea is expected to renew diplomatic efforts to restore stability and avoid military conflict. Trump and Kim are staying in separate hotels in the famous Orchard Road area of Singapore, dotted with high-rise luxury apartment blocks, offices and glittering shopping malls. The US President is expected to be alone in a room with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un for up to two hours when they meet from 2am UK time on Tuesday. Only translators will be present for the meeting at a luxury Singapore resort, a US official said - suggesting there will be no aides or note-takers, a highly unusual move. Officials could then drop in for a further hour but they admitted: We will not be surprised by any scenario.  Trump himself has said he could make a decision in the first minute or spur of the moment - raising the possibility he could make a commitment with no aides or note-takers present. The US is seeking the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. But North Korea has previously rejected the idea of unilateral disarmament.  It has also been reported that Trump will have access to the nuclear button at all times during his two-hour long meeting with Kim.

Gaffer Neil suggested Murray was just trying too hard to shine in front of his fellow-Dundee supporters and was happy with his contribution.The Dee boss is desperate to add more threat to his side and

studio nine years ago when he launched Dundee Music Studios, said his father was president of the Tayside Opera for many years.\u0026#8220There was constantly people coming around the house, other people from the opera would all come around, drink some wine and sing some songs,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220It was mainly classical music that I was interested in when I was very very young.\u0026#8220If there was ever any children\u0026#8217s parts, me and my sister would get dressed up and thrown on stage, I sure to enjoy that.\u0026#8220There was never much singing involved, it was mostly just being children running around on stage.\u0026#8221Tristan said he started playing the cornet when he was four or five, and then moved on to the baritone horn while he was a student at Grange Primary School in Monifieth.\u0026#8220But I always wanted to play the trombone and they didn\u0026#8217t have one in the music department, but eventually the must have got a bit of extra cash and got a trombone so I started playing the trombone,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And I did that right thought to near the end of high school.\u0026#8221While he trained and began working as an engineer, he started DJing electronic and hip-hop music, later moving into scratch DJing.\u0026#8220Some of my friends had a band and my best friend had just been asked to be the drummer so he asked if I wanted to come along and do some scratching on top of the music,\u0026#8221 he said.After a few weeks, Tristan asked if they were ok with him bringing along his synthesizers and the band kicked off from there.\u0026#8220It was great, we had a great time doing that and the band was together for about 12 years.\u0026#8221Spending most of his spare time being involved in music and going into so many studios, Tristan said he always had it in the back of his mind that he one day wanted to run his one of his own.He took a few business classes and looked into what it would involve, but the timing didn\u0026#8217t feel quite right.Then in 2007, both his parents passed away within two months of each other.\u0026#8220It kind of just turned my life on it\u0026#8217s head,\u0026#8221 he said.He quit his job and spent six months travelling around Australia with his future wife, before coming back to DundeeThen in 2009 he was told that a charity studio run by his friend\u0026#8217s dad near the Marketgait was up for sale, and Tristan decided to take the chance.\u0026#8220It was quite a big thing for me, a bit of a massive thing for me actually but at that point in my life it was a risk I was willing to take,\u0026#8221 he said.He launched the studio, a band booked one of his rooms full time and the business began to slowly grow, but it wasn\u0026#8217t until about a year and a half after opening that it began to turn profitable.\u0026#8220I remember six months into it being really really worried about things, that I might not be able to keep running,\u0026#8221 he

They were all raring to go.”Alongside primary school groups, there was also the chance for the dance programme’s elite dancers from the Urban Moves Junior Company, Urban Moves Training Company and Urban Moves Dance Company to showcase their skills.Alex added: “It was great having the development companies perform each night too.“I think it definitely gave the younger children some inspiration on what they can do and they just loved sharing the stage with them.”The Dance Company was also recently involved in a promotional video for Maggie’s Penguin Parade, which kicks off this summer, and will be heavily involved with shows throughout the next few months.Alex Hare, dance manager for Leisure and Culture Dundee, said the three day event was “absolutely fantastic”.She said: “The weekend was full of incredible dancing and each and every dancer and member of the audience had an amazing time.“The weekend showcase is an annual event and really gives the kids a chance to show the skills they have learned throughout the year in their dance classes.“In partnership with Dundee City Council, Urban Moves goes into primary schools each week after school and teaches the kids new routines and help them develop new skills.The Claypotts Castle PS (P1-3) Urban Moves Junior Group.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/Mervyn-Miller-496x372.jpg ","title":"dundee people trying to find after 73 years mervyns looking for family ties to dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn adopted man whose mother went into labour while in prison has appealed for information in Tayside as he now believes he has family ties to Dundee.Mervyn Miller, 73, was put up for adoption after he was born three months premature while his unmarried mother was in HM Prison Edinburgh, having been locked up in 1944 for shoplifting.Mervyn said he has lived a “lucky” life but, upon retirement, decided to trace his family history. He has uncovered ties to Dundee and is appealing to anyone who may have known his mother, whose birth certificate he has not found.He believes his mum, Irene Miller or Millar, was born in Canada but grew up and worked in Dundee. Mervyn thinks his maternal grandmother travelled to Canada while pregnant, but returned to Scotland shortly afterwards.He has found a cousin, Freda, and an uncle, Raymond, who live in Dundee, but neither has been able to shed much light on the mystery. Freda’s mum also lived in Dundee and Mervyn suspects she and his mum would have hung about together.He said: “It would be a great satisfaction to know what happened to her. We just can’t find a birth certificate. In a jute mill or other factory, everyone knows everyone so there might be someone in Dundee who knew my mother.”Irene ended up in Liverpool working as a prostitute but that is where the trail goes cold.His father is even more of a mystery, but as Mervyn is mixed-race he believes a man from Pakistan, India or Sri Lanka came to Dundee for the jute industry.Born with spina bifida, Mervyn spent much of his childhood at a children’s centre in Edinburgh.

Callum Morris have been added to their list of targets.Both are free agents, though, the Tangerines face a battle to land either signature.Etxabeguren was released by the Dark Blues last month after an injury-hit year and has returned to Spain.Whether he can be enticed back to Scotland remains to be seen, although, he did enjoy his time in Dundee.Morris, meanwhile, told Dunfermline he was leaving them to return to England but a move back to former club United might be enough for him to shelve those plans.The 28-year-old played 45 times for Jackie McNamara at Tannadice over two seasons but, like Etxabeguren, has a history of injuries.He did play 40 games last season for the Pars, however.Also on the list is former Partick man Frederic Frans.The Belgian centre-back is wanted by his former club also, as well as fellow-Championship side Ross County.Meanwhile, United have announced their first pre-season friendly.Csaba Laszlo’s men will head to Brechin City on Tuesday, July 3, kick-off

pub.Husky Levi slipped his harness outside a shop on Perth Road while his owner Carly Stevenson was inside – sparking a huge search operation lasting several hours.But the pet pooch was found three hours later enjoying the company of regulars at the Taybridge Bar.Carly had left Levi tied up outside a newsagent with Ollie, a Staffie, when the drama unfolded.The 29-year-old said: “It must have been around 8pm on Wednesday.“We were on our way to the park and I nipped into the shop.“It’s a regular trip and the dogs have been tied up countless times outside the store. When I came out of the shop Ollie was still there but Levi was gone.“Ollie started going towards the park so we started looking there. As Levi had broken out his harness, his name tag had come away as well.”The search for Levi, who will be two next month, stretched across the city with police officers even keeping an eye out for the dog.Carly said: “Given he is a husky and they have bounds of energy, we knew he could be anywhere.“I put a post up on social media and had family in Broughty Ferry looking for him too. I was obviously extremely worried about what had happened to him.“Two police officers had kindly joined in the search as well.”When Carly received a call from the Scottish SPCA she thought the worst had happened – only to discover Levi had simply befriended some folk having a cigarette outside the pub.She insisted Levi wasn’t in the doghouse for his antics, saying she was simply happy to have him back.She added: “When the call came in they told me, ‘he’s been traced safe and well in the pub’.“I couldn’t believe it as he had been missing from around 8pm until around 11pm.“We’d been searching all over the place and he was just across the road – in the pub of all places.”Kelsie Boland, 21, assistant manager at the bar, said its newest customer had stayed off the booze during his visit.She said: “We knew he was just a pup.“We gave him some food and he was really well behaved and got on well with the staff and the punters.“When Carly came in she was obviously upset but delighted to get him back.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1a516c449eb.jpg ","title":"jack hamilton signing a great bit of business says derek soutar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSigning 24-year-old Jack Hamilton is “a great piece of business” according to a man who knows a thing or two about keeping goal for Dundee.Derek ‘Soapy’ Soutar had two spells at Dens Park, totalling eight years, and has seen first-hand how good Hamilton can be.After Soutar suffered an injury in his time at Forfar back in 2012, a young keeper by the name of Hamilton came in on emergency loan to cover at the age of 18.Watching his progress since, Soutar was delighted to see him arrive at Dundee.Soutar said: “I was very surprised Hearts let him go.“He came in on loan at Forfar when he was just 18. He was a great size, very athletic and a really good shot-stopper, great at one-on-ones and his distribution was excellent, too.“With Jon McLaughlin leaving I thought it would be the ideal chance for Craig Levein to put Jack in for pre-season.“He’s moved on, though, and Dundee have a great signing.“I worked with Jack, he’s a great lad and really down to earth personality.“I think it’s a great bit of business by Neil McCann.“He’s a good age with plenty of experience as well at Hearts and all the different levels with Scotland.“It’s a massive signing for Dundee – he could be there for years to come.“He will have to bide his time, though, because Elliott Parish did really well at the end of last season after Scott Bain left.“Every goalie is going to have times when it’s not going for you but Elliott got through that and didn’t do a lot wrong. He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17b6e6b90a2.jpg ","title":"manchester united boss jose mourinho watches dundees former arsenal midfielder glen kamara amid transfer speculation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJose Mourinho was watching as Dundee’s Glen Kamara picked up his fourth international cap in Finland’s friendly defeat in Romania.The 22-year-old has drawn plenty of interest in his time at the Dark Blues – Mourinho, however, was only there as a guest of Romanian agent Ioan Becali and stressed in an ad-hoc TV interview he wasn’t looking at players, just enjoying his time off.Kamara, meanwhile, despite only joining up with the Finnish national squad on Monday, played the majority of the second half in Ploiesti.The Finns, ranked 62nd in the world and not at this year’s World Cup, started the friendly match well but fell behind in the first half to Cristean Manea’s 37th-minute strike.In the second period, Kamara made his entrance after 57 minutes for Nottingham Forest’s Thomas Lam but almost immediately the team fell further behind.On 61 minutes, winger Ciprian Deac finished from close range to give the Romanians a home victory.Finland boss Markku Kanerva said: “The start was challenging but we looked good. We fought well and did not give up.“Of course, we should not be satisfied with this result but we did not have a full squad.“At the end, we got a little bit to attack more.“I had to think a little about the team when Pyry Soiri and Glen Kamara were only involved on Monday for the first time so they only played the second period.“There was little to be done in the last third.

redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to

It will also incorporate the North tower, which has been open to the public as a viewing platform for more than a year and Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.Locals and tourists can also look forward to new galleries which will host national and international exhibitions, displays celebrating the creativity and beauty of the Highlands as well as \"retail and catering\" which showcase the best of what the region has to offer.\u0026nbspA new hotel could also be created as part of the makeover.The project is to be part-funded by \u0026pound1.5 million from the \u0026pound15 million Scottish Government contribution to the Inverness-Highland City-Region Deal.The remainder will involve hefty borrowing by the council although it said it would benefit from the rents of the various businesses in the existing buildings.Speaking at the castle Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing, co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment, said the investment would support economic growth and create a \"sustainable, viable and must-see attraction to celebrate the spirit of the Highlands\".He added: \"It will create a once in a generation opportunity for future redevelopment for the city and the Highlands to create something of high architectural value \u0026ndash precisely the opposite of the existing buildings.\"Equally thrilled council leader Margaret Davidson said: \"This has been a long-held ambition.\"It will help us achieve our vision for this iconic site and Inverness Castle\u0027 place as part of a range of tourism assets this region has to offer.\"Highland planning director Stuart Black confirmed the purchase price was \"over \u0026pound5 million\", adding: \"We\u0026rsquore still in final discussions with the owner but it will be agreed by the end of June and then we\u0026rsquoll release the purchase price.\"He said the options for the site were to renovate, to redevelop partially \u0026ndash perhaps by removing the upper deck \u0026ndash or what he termed \"comprehensive redevelopment\".Project manager Graham Watson, of High Life Highland, said: \"It\u0027 a one-off opportunity for Inverness to really look at how it see its future for Castlehill.\"The attraction envisaged for the castle will promote the Highlands\u0027 \"creativity, wellbeing, culture, heritage and natural environment\".Monday 11 Jun 2018 6:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04043000/04043681.jpg","title":"Yellow peril told to look the other way","story":"\u0026nbspTRAFFIC wardens have been ordered not to slap fines on motorists in an Inverness\u0026nbspstreet \u0026ndash because the parking signs are invalid and council workers are too busy fixing potholes to find time to take them down.The \"yellow peril\" has been instructed to turn a blind eye on Greig Street until a maintenance team can get round to putting up correct signage.The move has left B\u0026ampB owners scratching their heads wondering how they can convince their guests to ignore the signs and assure them they will not get a ticket.\"Surely the council can do better than that,\" said Acer Glen Guest House owner Stephen Bowsher.\"I can quite believe they\u0026rsquore busy fixing potholes but are they really expecting me to turn around to a guest and say \u0026lsquoI know what the signs say but that\u0027 OK, you can just ignore it?

latest figures from April this year from regulator Ofgem show the average available tariff is around £1,138 a year, based on average of dual fuel, direct debit and available paper tariffs from the six large suppliers with the cheapest being around £788 based on typical consumption and dual fuel average of available paperless tariffs paid by direct debit.Current council tax and Scottish Water

choosing instead to spend what they’ve saved on themselves their hobbies or even using it towards a holiday.“And that’s easy too because Woodland Grove is close to excellent road, rail, sea and air

parents, and other park users, while we clean it up.“With the summer here and youngsters out enjoying using the play park, we’ll wait until a quieter time of the year before arranging for the gloss paint to be removed, as the site will probably have to close while work is ongoing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"fans say farewell to dons hero neale in pittodrie night of laughter and tears","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of fans and former team-mates paid tribute to Gothenburg Great Neale Cooper at an emotional Pittodrie memorial.The former footballer, who helped the Dons clinch the European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1983, passed away on May 28 after being found injured in a stairwell at a block of flats in Aberdeen.Around 4,500 fans – along with most of the Gothenburg Greats – packed the Richard Donald Stand last night as the club paid tribute to the man supporters called a “proper Aberdeen loon” and “a great man”.Applause rang out at the end of the night as 220 red and white balloons were released into the blue sky above Pittodrie, each symbolising the 220 games Cooper played for the club.Earlier in the day his friends and family paid their respects at a private funeral service, but they joined fans at Pittodrie to say goodbye to the popular player.Friends from the footballing world, including Joe Harper, Willie Miller, Craig Brown, Archie Knox and Andy Dornan, shared touching and funny stories about life with Neale, who was known as Tattie.Former Evening Express sports editor Charlie Allan also shared his memories.Son Alex Cooper, nephew Doug Blake, fan Jock Gardiner and childhood friend Paul Alexander also brought tears to the eyes of supporters with their memories of the former Airyhall Primary and Hazlehead Academy pupil.One of the fans in attendance, Iain McDonald, 70, of Bridge of Don, still has his original Gothenburg ticket from May 11 1983.He said: “It’s sad, very sad that he was the youngest and he was the first one to go. I think that says it all.“He was such a competitor. That’s what always struck you about him.“The ceremony is a brilliant way to commemorate his life. It shows his family a lot of folk are thinking about him.”After the service, fans praised the touching tribute.Duncan Smith, 46, of Heathryfold, said: “It was brilliant. Absolutely superb, and quite emotional.“He was a proper Aberdeen loon.“The Gothenburg Greats were my heroes when I was a kid.”Valerie Donald, 53, of Hardgate, said: “It was just brilliant. It was really emotional, and it was very well organised as well.“There were lots of lovely stories about him, they put a lot of thought into it.”Graham Morrice, 56, from Woodside, said: “It was a great tribute to a great man. Aberdeen thought the world of him, and he thought the world of Aberdeen.”Two fans, Patricia and Ali Anderson, travelled from Elgin to be at the ceremony.Ali said: “It was brilliant.“There’s not many people who would get that.”Patricia, who knew him, added: “It was just exactly him. That’s exactly what he was like. He was a wonderful person.”Tributes, which included football shirts, scarves and banners, as well as numerous flowers, were lined up in the ground as well as flower displays carrying the messages“Stand Free” and “RIP” Tattie.Amid the sadness were plenty of smiles as fans heard tales from the former Dons star’s life, with many speakers greeted with cheers and prolonged applause.The event also included videos of Neale, and included his recent appearance at the Gothenburg Greats night on May 11, as well as excerpts from interviews and press calls over the years.Images spanned his entire career, including his famous goal against Rangers in the 1982 Scottish Cup final, and his time as manager for Ross County.A book of condolence was set up in the lower concourse of the Richard Donald Stand for anyone who wanted to leave their thoughts and well-wishes following the ceremony.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"head gardener appointed at aberdeen royal infirmary","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans to create a staff garden at an Aberdeen hospital have taken a step forward with the appointment of a head gardener and new design ideas for the space.The idea for the garden, located at Aberdeen Royal Infimary, was conceived after the success of the site’s Robertson Family Roof Garden.A dedicated staff-only facility, it will be accessed via swipe card and will be available 24 hours a day.Similar to the Robertson Family Roof Garden, which opened in 2016, the garden will be charitably funded and maintained.It will be located in the internal quadrangle, off the main corridor of ARI – which is currently home to the Grampian Hospitals Art Trust portable buildings.It has been designed to act as a space where staff can enjoy fresh air during their breaks and improve their health and wellbeing.The project, which it is hoped will be completed next year, has now appointed Diana Robertson as its head gardener – she previously filled the same role at Drum Castle.NHS Grampian’s healthcare chaplain the Rev James Falconer is spearheading the project.He said: “We are making progress although we are still at the very early stages.“We’re very pleased to have Diana Roberston as our head gardener – she will be excellent.“We also have some exciting plans for the design of the garden.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

She died because there was no match, but I signed up because of her.\u0026#8217Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.The identity of recipient and donor must be kept confidential for two years, to protect them both, but the pair exchanged cards, giving Brett and David the chance to learn a bit about each other.Then, on Sunday June 3, the long-awaited meeting took place in Campbeltown.Brett continued: \u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met. I was a little bit lost for words but I gave David a hug and shook hands and said thank you. We had a lovely evening together with our families and the kids played together, which was great.\u0026#8216Without David, my kids would have grown up without a father.\u0026#8216The first couple of minutes were a little bit overwhelming because there was so much anticipation,\u0026#8217 said David .\u0026#8216Our kids got along really well and I see us becoming friends rather than anyone feeling like they owe us something,\u0026#8217 he continued.David now works for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) and is involved in its partnership with Anthony Nolan, which has now recruited more than 10,000 potential donors.Amy Bartlett, regional development manager for Scotland said: \u0026#8216The SFRS and Anthony Nolan partnership has already resulted in 28 people donating stem cells but Brett and David are the first pair who have been able to meet, so it’s an exciting moment.\u0026#8216I would encourage anyone who is aged 16-30 and in good health to consider joining the register and visit anthonynolan.org/join.

After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a dramatic way to aid learning at tarbert academy","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/06/18, 6:21 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert Academy primary pupils took part in a drama workshop based on the topics the children are studying.Rachael MacFarlane, a former pupil of Tarbert Academy, ran the one-day workshop, offering 45-minute sessions to five different year groups within the school.The history-based workshops which Rachael stages usually take place in London where she lives, but after being given the opportunity to offer the workshops to the Tarbert school she was pleased to help.Rachael said: \u0026#8216I loved bringing drama to the school in this way.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago.

After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall.

We tried all kinds of things but nothing seemed to help. “My wife went online and found children’s charity Bibic and we spoke to them. They were a godsend and they guided us and helped Dominic through a lot.    Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors. We wanted to help Bibic as they were instrumental in helping the way Dominic is today and SAAS helped Dominic from a very young age.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.

Musselburgh\u0026rsquos Iceland store is back open after being closed for the refurbishment project.  The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.  A council spokeswoman confirmed they had and would continue to work closely with police colleagues in \u0026ldquotackling anti-social behaviour in its many forms.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis can involve action being taken against the individuals responsible for the behaviour itself, alongside engagement with parents or s when appropriate.  \u0026ldquoOn the back of operations like the one at Bullet Hill, we also work with colleagues from other council departments to co-ordinate the clean-up of any affected areas so that members of the public can continue to enjoy our open spaces without debris from anti-social behaviour."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4089089.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=180\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Residents call for change on recycling boxes","story":"              LOCAL residents have urged\u0026nbspEast Lothian Council to ditch recycling boxes for wheelie bins after the local authority produced a video about the\u0026nbsprecycling process.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.

I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.

The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops. We are grateful for and value all responses, which will be taken into consideration as we look to agree a strategy which meets future needs in and around our communities."},{"url":null,"title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!  John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

In total, 24 fourth-year students from Musselburgh Grammar School received hands-on experience in team building, staging an event, kitchen and cooking essentials, and barista skills as part of an ongoing partnership with the school.  The students also heard presentations from Craig Bonnar of award-winning catering company and official racecourse supplier Heritage Portfolio Susan Manchester, general manager of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art cafes and Sarah Montgomery, the racecourse\u0026rsquos senior operations and commercial manager.  Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.  In previous years, racecourse staff have undertaken a number of volunteer activities to support local causes as part of the annual Give and Gain Day, including restoration work at Olivebank Children\u0026rsquos Centre and a beach clean at Fisherrow.  This year, Musselburgh was one of 20 UK racecourses to take part in the Racing Together Community Day, which supports a range of activities in local communities.  Sarah Montgomery said: \u0026ldquoIn past years we have been very active in supporting Business in the Community\u0026rsquos Give and Gain days but this year we opted to strengthen the relationship we have been building with Musselburgh Grammar School.  \u0026ldquoWith excellent support from Heritage Portfolio, we were able to put on a diverse programme which gave real-life experience to 20 students who have expressed an interest in hospitality and tourism careers, and this will contribute to their employability pathways initiative.  \u0026ldquoThree of those students returned to the racecourse to support us in hosting a British Horseracing Authority roadshow which provided a valuable opportunity for the pupils to put their training into practice and which will be a useful addition to their CVs.

She said: \u0026ldquoThis kind of real-life insight into the world of work and the wider hospitality and tourism sector is extremely helpful in giving students the experience and information which will help them decide on a career path they could potentially follow on leaving school.  \u0026ldquoAccess to the racecourse facilities and to experienced industry professionals who can share valuable insights is a real bonus and we are delighted that Musselburgh Racecourse was willing to work with us in supporting our young students as they prepare to transition from education to the working world."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870601.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc2 martini-tablet-src=/resources/images/7870601.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc3 martini-desktop-src=/resources/images/7870601.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Petition over Cockenzie site taken to Holyrood","story":"              PRESSURE has been piled on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos planning minister as local politicians demanded he reverse a decision to call in plans for the former Cockenzie Power Station site.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.

The budget retailer has appointed Deloitte to handle an administration after last-ditch rescue talks with R Capital broke down over the weekend.  Poundworld, which is owned by TPG Capital, has 335 stores.  The stores in and around Glasgow set to go are:\u0026nbspClydebank, Cumbernauld, East Kilbride, Glasgow Argyle, Glasgow Forge, Glasgow Forge Retail Park, Greenock, Hamilton, Motherwell, Paisley, Port Glasgow, Shawlands and Wishaw.  Bargain Buys in\u0026nbspAirdrie, Kilmarnock and Paisley will also close.  Poundworld\u0027s collapse comes after both Toys R Us and Maplin fell into administration earlier this year.  Deloitte will try to find a buyer for the business, and has said there are no redundancies or store closures at this time.  Clare Boardman, joint administrator at Deloitte, said: \u0026ldquoThe retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging and Poundworld has been seeking to address this through a restructure of its business. Unfortunately, this has not been possible.  She said the business was hit by falling footfall, alongside rising costs and weak consumer confidence.  A spokesman for TPG said putting the business into administration was a \u0026ldquodifficult decision.  \u0026ldquoWe invested in Poundworld because of our belief in how the company serves its customers and the strength of its employees, he added.  \u0026ldquoDespite investing resources to strengthen the business, the decline in UK retail and challenging behaviour affected Poundworld significantly.  It is understood that TPG and Poundworld\u0026rsquos management rejected offers to buy the business out of a pre-pack administration, and were hoping to sell it as a solvent business.  Other parties named as possible buyers were turnaround specialist Alteri Investors and Poundworld\u0026rsquos founder Chris Edwards.  But a deal could not be struck.  Poundworld\u0026rsquos losses widened in 2016-17 to \u0026pound17.1 million, from \u0026pound5.4 million of losses the year before.  The news came just days after House of Fraser detailed its plans to shut 31 stores, affecting around 6,000 jobs.  House of Fraser is seeking landlord approval for the restructuring plan, which is a form of insolvency known as a Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA).  A raft of CVAs have been struck in recent months as retailers struggle amid surging costs, rising business rates, competition from online rivals and a slowdown in consumer spending.  Other retailers undertaking CVAs in a bid to keep trading include New Look, Mothercare and Carpetright.

The Edinburgh parade was part of Processions, a mass participation artwork taking place simultaneously in the capitals of the UK to mark the achievements of the women\u0026rsquos suffrage movement.  The women and girls on the march wore suffragette colours of green, violet and white and were choreographed to appear as a moving suffragette flag.  The Edinburgh participants gathered at the Meadows before heading off through the city, ending by marching down the Royal Mile to the sounds of a piper playing Flower Of Scotland and past the Scottish Parliament.  Those taking part spanned all ages and many carried banners covering a range of causes.  These included embroidered banners thanking the \u0026ldquosister suffragettes, others proclaiming the suffragette slogans \u0026ldquoEquality for Women and \u0026ldquoDeeds Not Words and some simply stating \u0026ldquo100 years.  Modern political causes were also in evidence, with banners for the WASPI women fighting for pension equality.  Political parties were among the groups taking part in the parade, which was open to women and girls and those identifying as such, and other organisations involved included the Girl Guides and the Scottish Women\u0026rsquos Institute.  The event was produced by Artichoke and commissioned by 14-18 NOW, the UK\u0026rsquos arts programme for the First World War centenary.

Businessman Arron Banks, the founder of the Leave. EU group, is due to give evidence to the Commons inquiry into \u0026lsquofake news\u0026rsquo this week.  After initially refusing, he has now agreed but says he is the victim of a \u0026ldquowitch hunt.  In his book, The Bad Boys of Brexit, Mr Banks admitted a single meeting with the Russian Ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, in September 2015.  However the Sunday Times and Observer reported an email trail revealing further meetings between the two men and Leave.EU spokesman Andy Wigmore.  At one meeting, in November 2015, the day after the Leave.EU launch, the ambassador introduced Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore to a Russian businessman who offered a potentially highly lucrative business deal involving six Russian goldmines.  Mr Banks also visited Moscow in February 2016, during the referendum campaign.  And in November 2016, three days after Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore met President-elect Donald Trump in New York, they had a lunch with the ambassador.  Mr Banks told the Sunday Times he also handed over phone numbers for members of Mr Trump\u0026rsquos transition team to Russian officials.  Damian Collins, chair of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said the discovery of the links was \u0026ldquobig news and very relevant to his \u0027fake news\u0026rsquo inquiry.  He told BBC Sunday Politics that the public had a \u0026ldquoright to know the nature of the contacts.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe want to understand more to what extent Mr Banks profited from his relationship with the Russian embassy. Did he make money out of it?  \u0026ldquoDid he use that money to fund campaigns? If he didn\u0027t then that\u0027s fine but given the prominent role he played we\u0027ve got the right to ask these questions.\"  Mr Banks, who gave \u0026pound12m in donations to Ukip and the Leave side, told the Sunday Times: \u0026ldquoI had two boozy lunches with the Russian ambassador and another cup of tea with him. Bite me. It\u0026rsquos a convenient political witch-hunt, both over Brexit and Trump.  He later joked to Reuters that he was \u0026ldquostill waiting for the cheque from Moscow.  He said: \"This is just complete, absolute garbage - it is like the Salem witch hunt. They just keep on screaming \u0027witch\u0027, \u0027witch\u0027. They are trying to discredit everyone involved in Brexit.\"  Mr Wigmore said Leave.EU never offered any campaign information to any Russian.  The extent of the links with Russia was revealed in a cache of 40,000 emails shared by Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore with the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who ghost-wrote The Bad Boys of Brexit.  She said the two men had been \u0026ldquoshamelessly used by the Russians, but that did not invalidate the judgment of the 17.4m people who voted to leave the EU.  Leave.EU was last month fined \u0026pound70,000 for breaching election law in the EU referendum.  The Electoral Commission said the group, which was separate from the official Vote Leave campaign, failed to report at least \u0026pound77,380 of its spending.

New legislation being introduced to Holyrood would hand councils extra powers to prohibit parking on pavements and double parking.  Previous efforts to address the issue were held up by various complications, including whether the necessary powers were devolved to Scotland.

It also allows for the creation of low emission zones \u0026ndash such as that proposed in Glasgow \u0026ndash which will be under civil rather than criminal enforcement.  Transport minister Humza Yousaf said the legislation would give local authorities a new model to revitalise bus services.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are also providing clearer options for authorities to pursue local franchising or provide services themselves in appropriate circumstances.  \"Beyond bus services, this Bill will allow for decriminalised enforcement of low emission zones, double parking and parking on pavements.  \"This will help transform our towns and cities into cleaner, more accessible and more pleasant spaces to travel and enjoy.
