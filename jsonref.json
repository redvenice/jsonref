If you’ve found this article in a desperate Googling spree, breathe a sigh of relief. We’ve put together a proper guide on what to do if a condom gets stuck in your vagina or anus.This is good advice in general, but it does actually serve a purpose beyond making you feel less frazzled.If you’re tense, your vagina or your anal passage will contract, making removal of the condom even trickier.If you find yourself in a mad rush of panic, take a break from thinking about the condom debacle entirely and come back to it in a bit. It’s not a great idea to keep a condom stuck inside you for a long time, but half an hour or so really won’t make a difference. Use that time to relax.Try squatting or getting on all fours, then with clean fingers (with neat, trimmed fingernails to avoid any tearing. Ouch) see if you can feel the condom with your finger tips.If you can, you should be able to gently hook the condom until it’s a little lower down. Once that’s done you can either continue to wriggle the condom out with one finger, or insert two fingers in a pinching motion to pull that sucker out.Please, please, please, only use your fingers. Not tweezers, not scissors, not a chopstick, not anything else. Anything sharp and you’re risking seriously injuring your vagina, and anything not attached to your body could end up being taken in anally and get stuck, too. Then you’ll have two things stuck up your bum and you’ll feel a bit silly.If you can’t feel the condom with your fingertips, it’s time to push it out.If the condom is trapped in your anal passage, you can do this by trying to do a poo (sit on the toilet in case some faeces actually does come out).If the condom is in your vagina, you’ll need to activate the muscles you’d use to birth a baby. It’s easier if you squat or stand with one leg resting on the toilet.Do a few pushes and see if the condom is lower down or has come out. Don’t do this to the point that you’re frustrated and sobbing – you’ll tense up and only make things harder.If they helped to get the condom stuck in there, they can help you get it out of there.Ask your partner to lend a helping hand and see if they can gently remove the condom. They’ll be able to get a proper look at what’s going on (while you’d need to bend over or do some strategic mirror placement) and come at the problem from a different angle. Literally.If you’re unable to get the condom out, don’t scrabble around for hours – go to the doctor or a gynaecologist.I promise, there’s no shame in asking for professional help, and it’s very likely that they’ve seen worse than a condom stuck inside someone.They’ll have the tools needed to easily and safely remove the condom. Yes, it may feel a touch embarrassing, but it’s much better to get it sorted as soon as possible than spend days letting the condom fester before finally giving in and asking for help.If the condom slipped off during sex, that means there were moments that the sex was unprotected – putting you at risk of pregnancy and the transfer of STIs.If you’re not on a hormonal contraceptive, it’s wise to take the morning after pill in this instance.You’ll need to get a sexual health check (as you should be doing regularly regardless) to make sure you’ve got the all-clear.It’s worth seeing your doctor or gynaecologist even if you are on contraceptives and both you and your partner have been checked, so that they can check no damage has been done and no scraps of condom are still hanging out in your bits.Don’t be put off condoms because of this mishap – they’re not all bad and the safety benefits far outweigh the risks.The reason for the initial slippage may have been down to a sizing issue, so if you’ve ended up with a stuck condom situation, it’s worth trying out a tighter condom to make sure it doesn’t happen again.The debacle may also have been caused by incorrect wear (have a brush up on your ‘putting on a condom’ skills) or using a condom that was too thin to withstand sex without tearing.Don’t let this experience put you off sex or condom-use – just reflect on what happened, make sure you’re safe, and try again. It’ll be okay.MORE: In response to Amber Davies, here are eight rules for sex you actually need to followMORE: Why is your vagina itchy?MORE: ‘Butt plugs, whips and vibrators’: 12 people reveal what’s in their goodie drawers"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_6853549.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;h=325\u0026amp;crop=1\" alt=\"Rickshaw driver confronted \u0027for charging couple £150 for 1.5-mile ride\u0027\" class=\"img-align-none size-full wp-image-7457068\" data-rewritten=\"true","title":"rickshaw driver confronted charging couple 150 1 5 mile ride","story":"A rickshaw driver has been confronted in central London after he tried to charge two tourists £150 for a 1.5 mile journey that took just nine minutes.The footage was shot in Knightsbridge at 7pm on Monday after the trip from Selfridges on Oxford Street.He shouts ‘don’t touch me, don’t touch me’ as people confront him over the exorbitant fee.Eventually the couple give him £25 for the ride.The driver was eventually given £25 for the nine-minute journeyThe man who filmed the incident said: ‘I felt really sorry for them as the guy was threatening them to make the payment of £150.‘I was filming him and he started to snatch my mobile phone, I was very upset.’He said: ‘I don’t come cheap.

It was a great achievement and I pay tribute to the work done by Tony Blair, Mo Mowlam and Paul Murphy, as well as those on all sides in Ireland, north and south, in achieving the crucial breakthrough of the peace process.\u0027No one wants to be marking the twentieth anniversary of the agreement while the assembly at Stormont remains suspended. Efforts must be redoubled to restore the assembly, and to ensure a lasting open border as part of the Brexit negotiations.\u0027There must be no return to a hard border between north and south, and no return to the horrors of the troubles. All of us on both sides of the Irish Sea have a responsibility to maintain hope for the future.\u0027The history of Ireland is a great teacher of oppression and brutality, imagination and poetry. For Irish communities everywhere – including in my own constituency – the Good Friday Agreement will always embody their hopes for peace and justice.

Prince Harry interviews former US President Barack Obama as part of his guest editorship of BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme in December‘This is very much about them getting married surrounded by their families and friends,’ a source said.‘It is not a big state occasion in any way. It is an intimate family wedding. Well, as intimate as a royal wedding can be.’The prince’s spokesman said the Queen backed her grandson’s decision not to invite politicians or foreign dignitaries for the sake of it.          The couple have decided not to invite any political leaders both from the UK and abroad, which means that even British Prime Minister Theresa May isn\u0027t on the list. Pictured is Prince Harry and Barack Obama at the Invictus Games in Canada last yearKensington Palace said: ‘It has been decided that an official list of political leaders – both UK and international – is not required for Prince Harry and Miss Markle’s wedding. Her Majesty’s Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.’ Government sources said Theresa May ‘wasn’t expecting an invitation’.Despite the wedding being an important national occasion, Harry is not in the direct line of succession – unlike his elder brother, Prince William, who had no choice but to invite dozens of politicians and Commonwealth representatives to his 2011 Westminster Abbey nuptials.Harry is currently fifth in line to the throne, but after the birth of his third niece or nephew later this month, will slip to sixth, behind the Cambridges’ three children.Prince Harry and Miss Markle have also chosen a much smaller venue than William and Kate, who were able to fit around 1,200 guests into Westminster Abbey, including then-Prime Minister David Cameron.

But what is the Belfast Agreement?What is the Good Friday Agreement?The Good Friday Agreement helped to end 30 years of sectarian conflict, that were also known as \u0027The Troubles\u0027. This conflict began when Northern Ireland separated from the rest of Ireland in the 1920s and away from British rule.Northern Ireland was then ided in two groups, the Unionists or the Loyalists, who wanted to remain a part of the UK and the Nationalists or the Republicans, who preferred the independence. Catholics protested after being discriminated against in the predominantly Protestant north and from the 1970s, violence erupted between armed groups on both sides. British troops were sent to the area, but came up against the largest of the Republican groups, the Irish Republican Army, or the IRA.The IRA bombed areas of Britain and Northern Ireland and Loyalists in groups like the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) were also responsible for many deaths. In 1972, the situation became markedly more serious as the IRA began targeting police officers and British army soldiers on the street.  Davis: The border impasse has become harder to resolve since Leo Varadkar became Irish PM14 people were killed by British troops during a peaceful protest led by the Catholics and Republicans in Derry and in a day that became known as Bloody Sunday, dampening hope that Northern Ireland would ever be peaceful again.However, in the 1990s, the IRA announced a ceasefire and after two years of discussions and 30 years of the Troubles, the Good Friday agreement was signed.A new government was formed with power being shared between the Unionists and the Nationalists in a group called the Northern Ireland Assembly. Every house in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was sent a copy of the agreement before the referendum was held in May 1998.The two countries voted in favour of the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Assembly took their seats in December. However, those who were against the peace, continued violence and in 2002, the Assembly was suspended and the UK government had to take over decision-making.In 2007, power was returned and the British army ended its operations in Northern Ireland, but ten years later, the deal collapsed and has yet to be restored.When was the Belfast Agreement signed?The Belfast Agreement was signed on Friday, April 10, 1998 at 5:30pm and on the day the deal was reached, US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland George Mitchell stated: ‘I am pleased to announce that the two governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland have reached an agreement.’Who signed the Good Friday Agreement?The Good Friday Agreement was signed by Prime Minister Tony Blair, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, SDLP leader John Hume, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams, Sinn Féin member Martin McGuinness and Labour Party politician Marjorie \u0027Mo\u0027 Mowlam.          David Davis said the Irish government had been influenced by Sinn Féin in its Brexit policyWhy did the DUP oppose the Belfast Agreement?Despite the GFA deal gaining widespread support across Ireland, Ian Paisley’s DUP was the only major party to oppose it, believing it would scupper a union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.However, distrust between parties caused problems when the agreement was first put in place, but Tony Blair managed to win over Ian Paisley. Issues also arose in 2017 when Martin McGuinness resigned as Sinn Fein deputy first minister after accusing the DUP of ‘arrogance’ while handling an energy scheme.The DUP’s Arlene Foster resigned and the Assembly collapsed, with McGuinness dying later in March 2017. Despite offers of help from Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, the DUP and Sinn Fein remain at loggerheads.Speaking in Belfast on April 10 2018, former DUP leader Peter Robinson said that he was ‘right to oppose’ the Belfast Agreement.‘Most people when they talk about the Belfast Agreement are talking about a wider process - it seems to have taken on some of the events that took place almost four years before it and every agreement that happened afterwards.‘So if we are talking about a process that has at its heart compromise, partnership, people working together to make progress, then I think the whole community should support that. The specifics of the Belfast Agreement itself, clearly I opposed - I think I was right in opposing it.’Does the Tory-DUP alliance affect the Good Friday Agreement? Despite the UK government remaining impartial when dealing with the unionists and the nationalists, a direct alliance with the DUP would change this. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams warned that a Tory-DUP alliance would lead to a \u0027coalition of chaos\u0027 and could put the GFA at risk. Alongside this, when writing for The Guardian, Jonathan Powell, the chief negotiator at the Belfast Agreement talks, said that the partnership was \u0027a terrible mistake with lasting consequences\u0027 that \u0027would risk undermining 20 years of hard work\u0027.Will Brexit be affected by the Belfast Agreement?Brexit secretary David Davis\u0027s comments about the Irish government being influenced by Sinn Féin in Britain\u0027s withdrawal from the EU could present some issues if a hard border is proposed. While Britain, Ireland and the EU have all stated that they want to avoid a hard border, many believe this is not possible with Theresa May\u0027s promise of a frictionless border while also leaving the EU customs border.While the DUP oppose a united Ireland as an alternative to remaining in the EU, Sinn Fein are touting it and officials fear that a return to before the Good Friday Agreement could occur, according to The Guardian. Former US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland George Mitchell warned that direct rule and a hard border could lead to a return of the violence seen from the 1970s on BBC\u0027s Today programme. George Mitchell said that a hard border would result in \u0027stereotyping resuming, demonisation resuming and people turn inward\u0027, and a lack of power-sharing could lead to \u0027regressive forces\u0027 becoming violent again.Leaders should see this as a \u0027dangerous signal...and act before there is a regression,\u0027 he added.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/23/4B07991F00000578-5600745-image-m-2_1523399455559.jpg","title":"Bull seal spotted Yorkshire Dales 50 miles nearest coastline","story":"    This fully-grown bull seal was spotted relaxing in a field – some 50 miles from the nearest coast          Discovered at Topcliffe Weir near Thirsk, North Yorkshire, it is believed to have followed fish from the North Sea inland along the River SwaleIts picture was taken by amateur photographer Karen Hargreave, from nearby village Asenby.She said: ‘Some friends of ours went for a walk, and saw something large in the river.

We don’t have statistics or numbers but it is fairly common,’ she said.‘If they don’t seem distressed or stranded we would urge people to just leave them, don’t approach them and keep dogs away as they are a wild animal after all.\u0027They can usually be there for a few days before finding their way back, but they spend a lot of their lives on land so they are usually fine.’          Rather than being moved by rescuers, the seal is being left to make its own way back to sea"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/06/4B00222000000578-0-image-m-12_1523338233555.jpg","title":"European Commission investigators raid Rupert Murdochs Fox HQ","story":"      Commission agents are understood to have begun searching the offices in Hammersmith, West London earlier today.

UCLA Law School professor Harry Litman, no fan of Dershowitz, says \u0027taint teams\u0027 work well and there\u0027s \u0027absolutely no cheating\u0027 because the stakes are so highAlthough the officers were acquitted in a California courtroom, the federal government won civil rights convictions against two of them.But the Justice Department prosecutors in the second case weren\u0027t permitted to see anything related to the earlier criminal trial, Litman explained.As a practical matter, he insisted, taint teams do their jobs well.\u0027I\u0027ve experienced it,\u0027 he said \u0027There\u0027s absolutely no cheating, certainly at the federal level. The consequences are too severe.\u0027Litman called the Justice Department \u0027ultra-hyper-vigilant, even paranoid, about this precise issue.\u0027But for Dershowitz, who helped win a murder acquittal for O.J. Simpson and succeeded in overturning the attempted murder conviction of Claus von Bülow, the constitutional issues are more important than the DOJ\u0027s trustworthiness – and bigger than the presidency.    Dershowitz said Monday night in a Fox News Channel interview that it had been \u0027a very dangerous day today for lawyer-client relations.\u0027The concept of assembling a taint team, he said, revolves around the Fifth Amendment, which protects Americans from being forced to incriminate themselves.So when the team sifts through Cohen\u0027s documents, hard drives and memory sticks, it will be searching for protected material that should be kept private.But the Fourth Amendment prohibits \u0027unreasonable\u0027 searches and seizures by the government – a description that could apply to scooping up communications between a lawyer and his client, except in extreme circumstances.And the Sixth Amendment guarantees Americans the right to \u0027the assistance of counsel\u0027 for courtroom defense, meaning no government can interfere with that relationship.Dershowitz told DailyMail.com that \u0027if the government improperly seizes private or privileged material, the violation has already occurred, even if the government never uses them.\u0027\u0027Remember who comprises the firewall and taint teams,\u0027 he explained, quoting in an email from what he said was a forthcoming column. It\u0027s \u0027other FBI agents, prosecutors and government officials who have no right under the Fourth and Sixth Amendments, even to see private or confidential materials, regardless whether it is ever used against a defendant.\u0027CNN contributor April Ryan asks if Trump is thinking about...Trump thinks he has the power to fire Mueller without...Kellyanne Conway\u0027s husband trolls Trump on Twitter with...Fire and fury: Read every word of Trump\u0027s rant after...\u0027Any evidence of any crime they now find is fair game\u0027:...Share this articleUltimately, Dershowitz\u0027s beef may be with whichever federal judge green-lighted the DOJ\u0027s request for a search warrant covering the places where Cohen lives and works.It\u0027s likely that the agency convinced the jurist that Cohen had documents showing evidence of a crime. But even so, the Harvard professor said, those documents could have been privately subpoenaed.He compared Monday\u0027s document dragnet to government surveillance of a confession heard by a priest, a patient\u0027s discussion with her doctor, or a husband and wife talking about their sex life.\u0027The government simply has no right to this material,\u0027 he said.Washington, D.C. criminal defense lawyer Barry Pollack told the Associated Press on Tuesday that it is \u0027extremely rare\u0027 for authorities to conduct searches in lawyers\u0027 offices. Such a search warrant is a measure of last resort because of problems posed by the attorney-client privilege, according to the Justice Department\u0027s manual for federal prosecutors.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/21/17/497182F700000578-0-image-m-27_1519232683761.jpg","title":"Lords committee says YouTube web giants need vet content","story":"Rapper is jailed for 30 years after police spotted him...Defenceless 17-year-old \u0027was murdered by gang of rival...Share this articleA YouTube spokesman said: \u0027We do not allow videos that incite violence, and we\u0027ll remove any such content.\u0027Music videos of different genres are allowed on YouTube and able to run ads where they don\u0027t breach our policies.\u0027          Videos of gangs promoting stabbing on Google-owned YouTube, alongside adverts for BT and Netflix"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/01/4B07E21500000578-5601473-Triathlete_James_Edgar_from_Northern_Ireland_was_sure_to_inform_-a-1_1523407958128.jpg","title":"Commonwealth Games athletes boast Tinder night","story":"    English boxer Luke McCormack (pictured) was among several Commonwealth Games athletes to inform Tinder users of his intention to \u0027have some fun while I\u0027m out here\u0027          Triathlete James Edgar from Northern Ireland was sure to inform prospective partners of his premium endurance, which ensured he \u0027can go all night long\u0027          Javelin throw star from Canada, Andre, boasted his impressive height and informed fans his sole objective was to have some funWhile some opted to keep their personal descriptions free of frisky language, others have gone in guns blazing - making no secret of their promiscuous intentions.Among those to thrust themselves onto the site was English boxer Luke McCormack, who bared his chiseled abs in a shirtless poolside photo.\u0027Sam Armytage, we still want an apology!\u0027 Angry Aboriginal...\u0027That\u0027s the best thing I\u0027ve seen all games!\u0027 Energetic young...Midas touch!

One parent had a go because there was a group of children from the other party and they were throwing balls, intimidating the kids and scaring them.\u0027Mrs Agius-Johnson said her mum then got a call from Mr Tuniewicz while they were still at the party, asking her not to be abusive to the staff.She said her and Mr Tuniewicz had an argument over the phone, and then she  personally rang him back and also argued with him.Following the party Mrs Agius-Johnson left a negative review on the company\u0027s Facebook page - which has since been removed - and then the arguments spilled over into messenger.She said: \u0027It\u0027s pretty awful really, my mam was in tears.

The way he has handled the situation is appalling.\u0027           Mrs Agius-Johnson says she often pays to hire the soft play for exclusive use and sells tickets to people she knows because her nine-year-old son - who is suspected to have autism - does not cope well with large groups.

Meanwhile ice cream parlours are on the rise, with 27 more springing up around the UK last year          Coffee shops are also bucking the trend, with independents and chains keeping business steady enough for 25 more to appear in the UK in 2017\u0027On top of this, many retailers are increasingly feeling the impact of the acceleration of online shopping as consumers begin to feel more comfortable with the price transparency and reliability of delivery options offered by online players.\u0027Digital offerings are increasingly becoming make or break in areas like fashion, but also for banks, travel agents and estate agents - all of which closed a significant number of high street outlets last year.\u0027The winners at the moment, such as nail bars, coffee shops, bookstores and craft beer pubs, are all flourishing because they serve the needs of emerging consumer segments such as experience-seeking millennials, and offer a differentiated physical proposition that online offerings can\u0027t compete with.\u0027Lucy Stainton from the Local Data Company added: \u0027There is of course no doubting that we are experiencing a period of great change in retail, and the question around the relevance and role of stores is still very much on the industry agenda.\u0027It is also interesting to note that despite the onslaught of digital and audiobooks, readily available via the likes of Amazon and Apple, booksellers are on the list of 2017 \u0027risers\u0027.           Despite the popularity of Amazon and e-books, bookshops are faring well with a net increase of 20 around the UK last year \u0027Perhaps unexpected but then again does this suggest there is hope for more traditional retailing of physical products, if done well?\u0027 On the struggles of clothing and footwear shops, Glen Tooke, consumer insight director at research firm Kantar, told the Guardian: \u0027People are trying to make the most of their time doing something with family or friends and then they go shopping on a Sunday evening on the internet.\u0027If you look at social media culture, if you are going to have an amazing time doing something you can put on Instagram, what is going to give?

The sock was partly clenched between the teeth.Russian TV reporter sneaks into Salisbury hospital where...Mummified monkey found in air duct of Minneapolis department...South Africans lay \u0027Mother of the nation\u0027 Winnie Mandela to...\u0027Get ready Russia, the missiles are coming\u0027: Donald Trump...Share this article\u0027The sock matched socks found in his home, which supports the possibility that they were his own. It causes a degree of concern, it might be entirely innocent but we simply cannot say.\u0027It is clear the sock was purposefully stuffed in his mouth. It would be a rather unusual thing to do to one self, I\u0027m not aware of this being a recommended practice of taking your own life.\u0027It is possible the headphones were inadvertently dragged into the mouth at the same time the sock was inserted. So it would suggest the sock was inserted in a hurried manner.\u0027          This picture shows CCTV footage of Alan Jeal in Truro the day before his body was discovered in PerranporthDr Jeffery also did not rule out the possibility that the sock was used as a sexual practice, erotic asphyxiation, where people intentionally restrict the flow of oxygen to the brain for the purposes of sexual arousal.While Dr Jeffery said she couldn\u0027t completely exclude a scenario where Mr Jeal suffered his injuries while lying in the water, she said they were much more likely to have been sustained as a result of a fall from height.He had a cut on the side of his mouth and she could not rule out contact with a knife, although they were no other possible stab wounds.Other features found significantly support drowning, including heavily waterlogged lungs.          Detective Inspector Sharon Donald on the beach at Perranporth on February 20, 2014Dr Jeffery concluded that Mr Jeal died as a result of drowning, in addition to the significant injuries suffered.\u0027The most likely scenario is that the injuries were caused by a fall from height, and drowning then occurred in the water,\u0027 she added.\u0027He died partially as a result of head and chest injuries as well as the drowning process.\u0027It is possible that this represents a very unusual suicide, although I cannot exclude the possibility that another person was involved in his death.\u0027An off-duty police officer was walking on Perranporth beach with his wife at around 2pm on the afternoon of Tuesday, February 25, 2014, when they found Mr Jeal\u0027s body.It was located around 30 metres directly in front of the Watering Hole bar.In a statement, the officer said the couple initially saw a shape at the water\u0027s edge and joked that it looked like a body.\u0027I didn\u0027t believe it was a body, I thought it was probably a couple of plastic containers,\u0027 he said.His wife walked closer and shouted to her husband that it was indeed a body.He added: \u0027It was an adult male who had his face down in the sand. He was naked apart from a trainer. The incoming tide was washing up around the body.. I could see a small amount of blood in the sea water next to the head. I noticed a cord (headphones) hanging down the man\u0027s torso.\u0027          The body of Alan Jeal, 64, was found on Perranporth Beach (file photo), Cornwall in February 2014The off-duty officer called 999 and arranged for the body to be covered and moved due to concerns it would wash into the sea with the tide.Mr Jeal was declared dead at the scene by paramedics.The inquest heard a set of white Apple iPhoneiPod-style headphones were found inside his mouth, as well as a rolled-up sock. The headphones were looped around the back of the sock, and were trailing out of his mouth.A navy Regatta jacket was found near his body. Inside the jacket pocket was Mr Jeal\u0027s wallet, containing a photograph of himself as a two-year-old boy.It is not known if a rucksack and woolly hat, also found on the beach nearby, are linked to Mr Jeal.A statement from Mr Jeal\u0027s brother, Derek was also read out by coroner Dr Emma Carlyon.In the statement Derek said his brother lived a \u0027solitary life\u0027 in Wadebridge, where he moved in 2004 after selling his property in Polzeath.Through his adult life he worked as a lab technician at the Glynn Research Institute in Bodmin, before working as an electrician in the Camel Estuary area. He retired in 20022003.In the statement, that was given in 2014, Derek said: \u0027Alan lived to surf and was a surf type.\u0027He lived a casual and relaxed lifestyle. He was a reclusive type with only a small circle of friends. He was interested in surfing and photography.\u0027We are shocked and deeply saddened by Alan\u0027s death and we are desperate for answers.

An average of 11 stores a day opened, while 16 a day closed. The data does not include independent shops.Fashion and footwear stores were the hardest hit in 2017, according to LDC, as shoppers’ freedom to spend on non-essentials was diminished by rising food price inflation, partly fuelled by the fall in the value of the pound after the vote for Brexit in 2016.However, there was a net rise in the number of beauty stores in 2017, while cafes, coffee shops, ice-cream parlours and bookstores also increased in number, according to the LDC data.The pace of closures increased substantially in the second half of last year, reflecting the switch to online shopping, combined with rising staff and business rates costs. Shoppers reined in spending, with consumer confidence reaching a four-year low in December. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “2017 was tough for the British retail industry, particularly the second half of the year. We saw volatility from month to month and across different sectors as wage growth failed to keep up with inflation, forcing many shoppers to think more carefully about their spending habits.”The problems have continued into the first quarter of 2018, which PwC said was the toughest first quarter since the last recession in 2009-10. Big names including Toys R Us and Bargain Booze owner Conviviality have fallen into administration, while New Look is closing dozens of stores in a major restructure. Mothercare, Carpetright and Homebase are all considering closing dozens of stores. On Tuesday, lingerie brand Ultimo confirmed that it is to be wound up, blaming “more cautious consumer spending”.Shoe chains Brantano and Jones Bootmaker called in administrators last year, resulting in the closure of about 170 stores in total, while discount fashion chain Store Twenty One went into liquidation, closing 125 outlets. Jaeger and Style Group, which includes Jacques Vert and Windsmoor, also closed some shops despite being rescued from administration.Some bigger chains including Clarks, Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Debenhams have closed a handful of stores as shoppers increasingly opt to browse and buy clothing via their smartphone or laptop.Glen Took, consumer insight director at Kantar, said clothing and footwear retailers’ troubles reflected a change in culture towards enjoying experiences rather than buying products. “People are trying to make the most of their time doing something with family or friends and then they go shopping on a Sunday evening on the internet. If you look at social media culture, if you are going to have an amazing time doing something you can put on Instagram, what is going to give? It could be you are going to wear the same shoes you wore last week.”The Works discount bookshop chain drove the growth in bookstores, while WH Smith has been adding new specialist book sites as readers return to physical books while sales of ebooks have slowed.But the rise of online services spurred a dramatic drop in the number of banks, travel agents and estate agents on British high streets last year. Travel agency chains were hit by the highest number of net closures - 326 - while 201 banks, including more than 60 HSBC branches, shut their doors. With the ability to access goods and services quickly from home, families have less reason to hit the high street and are more likely to buy items only when they need them rather than picking up something on impulse or planning ahead. High street expert Mary Portas said the government could help by cutting business rates, but retailers needed to adapt or die. “We are going through a massive transition. Businesses that are going down are sometimes too big to be nimble and responsive and sometimes they are just mediocre and they haven’t invested in what consumers want. It is about being innovative and creative.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc7fd6ca8228d666efb528b5117a76bdf53ccdd6/0_397_5880_3528/master/5880.jpg?w=5750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b33bf6a12390115482bda7f09b3d4c4f 11500w","title":"the gold coast sun drenched sin city that wants to shine","story":"Famed for parties, brawls and bikini-clad meter maids, Australia’s Vegas is more dynamic than its mythology suggests Pristine beaches stretching for 70km, enviable weather, world heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests, and enough big city infrastructure to keep punters interested – Australia’s Gold Coast is a pleasure centre. But for many it has a pervasive dark side: a city once branded as a sunny place for shady people.One of Australia’s most revered writers once told me he comes here to have his breakdowns. On a visit in 1997, Prince Charles was reported to have said its gaudy skyscrapers contributed to the “uglification” of one of the world’s top holiday spots. In 1984, the prominent Sydney architect Neville Gruzman suggested the city should be bulldozed into the surf.Today, the Gold Coast seems to be attempting that reinvention itself. It is Australia’s fastest growing city and larger than three of its capital cities (Canberra, Hobart and Darwin), with the 2018 Commonwealth Games doubtless accelerating a maturation already under way.Every month or so there’s a new hip place to be seen, an old high rise disappears and a shiny new one soars. Every week some new claim is made for the ultimate in gastronomic happiness.Do these ventures live up to the hype? Sometimes. But it hardly matters. The Gold Coast is a city built on hype, on rise and fall. As a longtime resident, I’ve experienced several waves of self-proclaimed urban renaissance and learned that, while the spin exists largely to generate the sale of sky homes, each growth phase possesses a grain of truth.The Gold Coast wants to grow up. But is that possible when the rest of the country’s estimations of it are so rigid?Unlike many major Australian cities, the Gold Coast does not retain much evidence of a colonial urban sensibility, in part because of rampant redevelopment and erasure, but largely because it never really got started.The urban vision was always more closely linked to a 20th-century American aesthetic. The influence of the strip cities of Miami, Los Angeles and particularly Las Vegas are in evidence as well as, more recently, nods to the 21st-century architectural ambition of Dubai and Shanghai. While each of these cities have marked differences they all share a postwar history of urban expansion and proliferation.All have grown at phenomenal rates, new frontier cities that owe less to major port affiliations or centrifugal notions of planning than they do to strip formations, late capitalism and experimental development. The big-ticket architecture says so.The $1bn luxury Jewel project currently under development epitomises this push for opulent new millennium design. An example of continuing high-end investment in architectural innovation, the development is a six-star three-tower structure modelled on shards of smoky quartz crystals found on a mountain in the region. The interpretation is refreshingly abstract compared with the ubiquitous “palm tree, primary colour” resort styling the Gold Coast has leaned so much on in the past.Across many sectors, the city is shrugging off the declarative localism it has played to in exchange for a more sophisticated spin on where it sits in the world. It will be interesting to note how the international spotlight will burn. In 2016, international tourism figures peaked at one million. Tourists from Asia make up the majority of those, as they have for decades. People from Singapore get the Gold Coast, as do people people from Hong Kong and Dubai – they are all cities that share a new frontier urban aesthetic.The real opposition to the Gold Coast’s ambition is national. Australians often experience the city in hyperactive mode, arriving to soak up the sun and get away with what they’re less likely to at home raging down streets like no one lives here, hiring mopeds and tuk tuks blasting Justin Bieber or ACDC, high on party drugs or table-sized martinis. Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.They may have visited in a pack of mates at the annual Schoolies festival – a Spring Break equivalent that erupted in the 1970s and still attracts tens of thousands of school leavers. Or they may have vibrant memories of flying through the hyperreal universes of the Dreamworld, Movieworld and Seaworld theme parks as kids. It’s these off-kilter experiences – the combination of bright lights, sunburnt skin and cringey recollections – twinned with the consistent media overplay that continue to define national opinions of a city locals affectionately refer to as “the Goldie”.It is not unusual for major cities to have underworlds: corrupt power centres and schlocky, sometimes violent nightclub strips. It’s just that the depiction of such things erupting on Australia’s Gold Coast makes great trash TV. Stock footage proliferates of schoolies vomiting in bins, bikies brawling in restaurants, meter maids in gold bikinis and bare-knuckle violence – but these things exist as a fraction of a much larger whole.The burgeoning arts scene is emblematic of the city’s evolution. Twenty years ago, arts visibility, policy and recognition barely existed, and certainly not at levels that could match commercial imperatives. Today, the Gold Coast can hold its own. Under the directives of the Culture Strategy 2023, the city council has invested $7m in the development of an arts and cultural programme for Festival 2018, linked to the Commonwealth Games, while a $365m cultural precinct funded by all levels of government will be launched in stages. Yet the attitude of the rest of Australia towards the city, even though it is now one of the top five tourist destinations nationally, seems to be: “We want you to stay in your box.” Evidence of the Gold Coast’s continuing appeal as a preferred place to holiday and live goes largely unacknowledged.In part, this paradox is related to class. Australia prides itself on being an egalitarian society, but it can be highly parochial and territorial. The rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne is legendary neither would ever consider the Gold Coast as worthy of debate.The city’s location in Queensland doesn’t help. From 1968 to 1987, the state was under the corrupt rule of the disgraced premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, known as the “hillbilly dictator”, who fostered the creation of a police state and opposed homosexuality, abortion, demonstrations against anti-apartheid and even the 40-hour work week. Perceptions of Queenslanders have been affected ever since.This is no different from the idea that Parisians are all rude or New Yorkers unfriendly. The Gold Coast is more dynamic than its enduring mythologies suggest. It does not so much resemble an overgrown Porpoise Spit, the mythical town made famous by the film Muriel’s Wedding: an acrylic land of hoop earrings, dumb surfers and undone housewives burning down backyards.Cities have moods and boroughs, and things only locals know. They are at their best when they surprise when you sink in to the city and relate to it on its own terms. The Gold Coast has been allowed to be trashy, glitzy and even obscene, as long as it doesn’t gatecrash the VIP party – one smoky quartz slipper already dangerously close to the rope. In any case, this won’t be the city’s last renaissance.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

A case in point, as has become sharply evident this week, is the much-vaunted “deconfliction” arrangement between Russia and Israel after the former entered the war in Syria on the side of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.Negotiated between Vladimir Putin and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, it was held up at first as evidence of the latter’s diplomatic skills – an arrangement that allowed Israel a free hand against weapons transfers from Iran to Hezbollah and maintained Israeli deterrence on its northern border.Over seven years, the civil war has dragged in multiple foreign nations, turning what started as a pro-democracy uprising into a quagmire of overlapping conflicts.Global powerhouses including Iran, Israel, Russia, Turkey, and the United States have all, to different extents, engaged their militaries in the conflict. At the same time, they have supported warring factions on the ground, including Iran-allied Hezbollah, Kurdish militia, and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces alliance. Islamic State and al-Qaida are also present.If that arrangement has for long looked very shaky, the reaction of Russia and Iran to Israeli strikes this week on an airbase in Syria, killing seven Iranian advisers, has brutally exposed the assumptions that underlie it, not least Moscow’s tolerance for Israel’s assumption of its freedom of action.The reality is that Israel – and Netanyahu in particular – has badly misread the trajectory of Russia’s re-engagement in the Middle East, which has created in the very kindest interpretation the context for Iran’s projection of its influence ever further west and ever closer to Israel’s borders.Why all this matters in the current febrile context following the latest alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria, is that Israel’s misjudgments sit at one corner of a dangerous matrix of unpredictability, perhaps unseen – as James Hohmann argued in the Washington Post – since the secretary of state Dean Acheson suggested in 1950 that Korea was outside the core defence perimeter of the US.On the American side that uncertainty around intentions has seen Donald Trump flip-flop so dramatically that in a handful of days he has somersaulted from suggesting first that his country was rushing for the exit on Syria to a situation where military strikes seem likely.In Israel, a wounded Netanyahu – who has built an entire political career on promising to be a bulwark against Iran – is now being confronted with his rhetoric and the consequence of his actions, not least his bloody public pricking of Iran in a way that Tehran may now find hard to discount.In the final corner there is Putin, whose calculations are opaque because that is his intention – not least over his ambitions and red lines.The result is a highly combustible situation in which no party to the conflict – direct or otherwise – can be certain of the assumptions that the others are operating under.All of which has created what Stephen Pinker describes in his illuminating book on violence and war, The Better Angels of Our Nature, as a classic “security” or “Hobbesian” dilemma, a situation where actions by a state ostensibly to heighten their security can prompt other states to act pre-emptively, risking a fugue of escalation. As more violence seems likely, what is also troubling is that the key mechanism for avoiding such an escalation – the UN security council – seems profoundly weakened by the further weaponisation of the US and Russian vetoes under both Trump and Putin.History teaches us that wars – from the first world war to Korea, the six-day war and the Falklands – are often fuelled by failures of messaging and interpretation.Looking around the Middle East today never has that felt more true. And never have wise heads been in such short supply.• Peter Beaumont is a Guardian reporter and former Jerusalem correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8cb60506392a8f6fc0abf15387a2372e2cf186e/205_173_2609_1566/master/2609.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f54715c0d268bb4629143af92ef29ae8 1240w","title":"mark zuckerberg facebook congress senate","story":"Senators let Facebook’s founder off the hook – but that’s got nothing to do with them being tech dinosaursThe one thing he won’t want is for his inquisitors to have learned from, and vowed to correct, the single, clear lesson from yesterday’s session, a lesson that has been demonstrated repeatedly over the years in both Washington and Westminster. Put simply: politicians are overwhelmingly useless at asking questions.Of course, there are exceptions. Parliamentary veterans still recall the late Robin Cook’s forensic interrogation of John Major’s government over the question of arms sales to Iraq. In the US, Senator Howard Baker propelled himself into Watergate legend by repeatedly asking the same question about Richard Nixon: “What did the president know and when did he know it?”But all too often they miss the target. As that Axios report observed: “Zuckerberg was well prepared, but he also benefited from redundant questioning that rarely included smart follow-ups.” Part of the problem was the clear ignorance, if not befuddlement, in the face of technology displayed by most of the senators, many of whom are of a ripe vintage. At times Zuckerberg resembled the polite teenager who visits his grandparents, only to spend the afternoon showing them how to turn on the wifi.But the wider problem is one shared by politicians of all ages, and not only when wrestling with tech. Again and again, a committee will have a key player accused of wrongdoing sit before them. Yet gifted with the chance to nail that player once and for all, they’ll watch him or her wriggle away, unscathed.Witness the 2011 appearance of Rupert and James Murdoch before the Commons culture committee. It was billed as the showdown that would, at last, force a confession of culpability in the phone-hacking affair. In the end, the session was remembered for the shaving foam pie a comedian launched into the face of Murdoch Sr, and the lightning response of Murdoch’s then wife, Wendi.That occasion triggered the same sense of frustration felt by anyone who watched Zuckerberg’s testimony on Tuesday. In both cases, the politicians mostly failed to ask short, sharp, concrete questions of a kind that demand a clear, illuminating or uncomfortable answer. Instead, they asked a blizzard of several questions in one go – which allowed the Facebook founder to cherrypick which bit he wanted to answer and which he wanted to ignore – or used their brief allocation of time to expound their own views rather than seek his, or asked such broad, abstract questions that Zuckerberg was allowed to reply with windy, time-filling platitudes.The obvious contrast was with the kind of interrogation meted out daily by the likes of BBC interviewers Mishal Husein or Andrew Neil: precise, persistent, and unforgiving of logical contradiction. It’s hard to imagine Zuckerberg sailing through that kind of examination quite so breezily.What accounts for this persistent failure by politicians handed the role of inquisitor? It can’t be a lack of training. So many politicians began as lawyers or journalists, where asking questions is half the job.Part of the answer is structural. These committee sessions mean the role of interrogator is shared between a dozen or more people, each allocated as little as five minutes. The lack of a single invigilator militates against sustained questioning, with follow-ups and repeated pressing of the subject for an answer that much harder.The remedy would be tightly planned coordination, so that the MPs or senators would agree in advance on overall strategy, deciding the three or four key questions and persisting with them until they got answers – with each colleague picking up where the other left off.But that goes against most politicians’ instincts. They compete with each other more readily than they cooperate. That’s obviously true when there is a partisan ide, but it’s true too of supposed allies in the same party: they are rivals, each straining to see their own brilliant question turned into a moment that makes the TV news or, better still, goes viral.The problem might lie even deeper. For what makes a truly good questioner? It requires not just curiosity, but the ability to sublimate, if only for a while, your own views as you tease out those of your interlocutor. Too many politicians struggle with that. You could see that yesterday: several senators came unstuck because they wanted the world to know what they think, which allowed Zuckerberg to hold back what he thinks and knows and does.The answer is for these committee members to allow their more tech-savvy aides to work together and come up with a list of questions that would truly put Zuckerberg on the spot – and then act as a unit to get answers. It would require politicians to make a fundamental change in the way they operate. And that, you might say, is a very big ask."},{"url":null,"title":"mark zuckerbergs facebook hearing sham","story":"Now that the initial show trial is done, we need the real dealOn Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg was in the hot seat. Cameras surrounded him. The energy in the room – and on Twitter – was electric. At last, the reluctant CEO is made to answer some questions!Except it failed. It was designed to fail. It was a show designed to get Zuckerberg off the hook after only a few hours in Washington DC. It was a show that gave the pretense of a hearing without a real hearing. It was designed to deflect and confuse.Each senator was given less than five minutes for questions. That meant that there was no room for follow-ups, no chance for big discoveries and many frustratingly half-developed ideas. Compare that to Bill Gates’ hearing on Microsoft, where he faced lawyers and staff for several days, or the Kefauver hearings, which were over a year. By design, you can’t do a hearing of this magnitude in just a couple of hours. The worst moments of the hearing for us, as citizens, were when senators asked if Zuckerberg would support legislation that would regulate Facebook. I don’t care whether Zuckerberg supports Honest Ads or privacy laws or GDPR. By asking him if he would support legislation, the senators elevated him to a kind of co-equal philosopher king whose view on Facebook regulation carried special weight. It shouldn’t.Facebook is a known behemoth corporate monopoly. It has exposed at least 87 million people’s data, enabled foreign propaganda and perpetuated discrimination. We shouldn’t be begging for Facebook’s endorsement of laws, or for Mark Zuckerberg’s promises of self-regulation. We should treat him as a danger to democracy and demand our senators get a real hearing.The best senators understood this was a show, and used it as such. “Your user agreement sucks,” said John Kennedy. “Are you a monopoly?” asked Lindsey Graham. (Zuckerberg “comically” responded: “It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me.”) Richard Blumenthal said we needed laws, not promises or apologies.Because each senator was limited to under five minutes, Zuckerberg tried to run the clock by talking about mission, philosophy or what he believed in. There were some good questions, but there was little chance for follow up. You could almost see him, well-trained to count the minutes, playing for time when things got a little hot.Senators Mazie Hirono and Cory Booker, for instance, both pointed out the damning reporting by Julia Angwin at ProPublica, which showed that employers and landlords were using Facebook for discriminatory ads. Zuckerberg defended the company by saying they were hard to flag, and that they depend on community flagging to stop them.The tools Facebook provides make discrimination easy. Facebook has monopoly profit margins, so it could easily provide real staffing to protect against discrimination, if it wanted to. It doesn’t want to.Hirono and Booker could have shown that, but, like the rest of the senators, they each had only a few minutes for a line of questioning. Zuckerberg replied with vague answers about how their comments were “important” or “interesting” or “an important conversation to have”.Some of the hearing seemed designed to figure out whether Zuckerberg is a good or bad man, or whether he has a good or bad – or bizarre – political philosophy. Zuckerberg strikes me as reliably self-serving. That doesn’t make him that interesting as the CEO of a corporate monopoly it makes him a run-of-the-mill robber baron. Asking Zuckerberg philosophical questions, such as how he thinks we should deal with questions of hate speech, treats him as a thought leader. Accepting his failures to catch discriminatory housing ads, for instance, treats him as a good-hearted actor with limited resources, instead of someone who is making monopoly margins and billions in profits.In my view, we need to break up Facebook from Instagram and the other potential competitors that Facebook bought up. We need to – at a minimum – move towards opt-in, we need to hold Facebook responsible for enabling discrimination, and we need to require interoperability.But that’s not enough. There is so much we don’t know about Facebook. We know we have a corporate monopoly that has repeated serious violations that are threatening our democracy. We don’t know how their algorithm treats news organizations or content producers, how Facebook uses its own information about Facebook users or how tracking across platforms works, to just give a few examples.Now that the initial show trial is done, we need the real deal, one where no senator gets cut off after a few minutes. The real hearing would allow for unlimited questions from each of our senators, who represent millions of people. If it takes two months of sitting in Washington DC, let it take two months. This is our democracy.

The latest article in our new economics series explores how it took back control• Listen to Aditya Chakrabortty talking about game-changing economic models on The Alternatives podcastLooming over one of the poorest parts of Plymouth, which is to say one of the poorest parts of Britain, is a giant graveyard. Its buried are not men and women, but the carcasses of 13 nuclear submarines. Some have been dead for decades, such as the HMS Conqueror, which sank the Belgrano 36 years ago. Nine still have nuclear fuel rods, and there have been repeated leaks of radioactive waste. The Ministry of Defence claims all are safe. Then again, it sometimes doesn’t even disclose breaches until months later, when MPs and journalists have had to winch out the truth.All this runs true to local history. For nigh-on five decades, Devonport had its own Berlin Wall, with 50 acres of land walled up by the military. Complete with barbed wire running around the top, it was loathed by locals. It was only toppled in 2007. “The navy, the army, the air force: they come in, they do what they want, and take away the bits of the city they want for themselves,” says councillor Chris Penberthy, who grew up near the dockyard.“People do things to Plymouth,” he says. “Plymouth hasn’t often been allowed to do things for itself.” He is referring to the blitz, followed by the imposition of an Abercrombie city plan and the throwing up of shoddy housing. He also means the way in which well-meaning policy experts will today pitch up with some cash and pilot their brainwaves in Devonport and the impoverished west of the city. They come with a grand scheme to deal with household budgeting or child malnutrition and stay for a few months until the money runs out. Then they hurry off. A 60s baby, Penberthy grew up to the smell of Farley’s Rusks baking nearby. It joined Clarks’ shoes on a long rollcall of big local businesses. This is the Plymouth that residents liken to a northern mill town or a Welsh mining village. Just like them, the industry left decades ago. Just like them, it voted for Brexit.Representing the ward next door to Devonport, Penberthy sees ingrained deprivation in one of the richest countries in human history. Primary schools hold “brushing clubs” to help children look after their teeth, and “for some of those kids, aged eight or nine, it’ll be the first time they use a toothbrush”. Ahead of next month’s local elections, women on doorsteps say, “I vote how my husband tells me.” Families ripped off by the benefits office and bilked of desperately-needed cash for their disabled children sigh, “They must be right – they are the government.”What lends this even greater piquancy is Plymouth’s naval history, still celebrated in the breakfast rooms of a hundred lodging houses, with their paintings of Francis Drake on a bowling green. Before the dockyard became a radioactive burial ground, it employed tens of thousands of men. Today that figure is about 2,500.Post-industrial, post-imperial, post-Suez, Plymouth is no ordinary city it is a place where the furs in which Britain wraps itself are revealed as so many rags. Which makes what it does instead important not just locally but nationally. What it is doing is one of the most intriguing experiments I have seen in any British city. However far from perfect, it shows what can happen when a council tries to shape how business behaves in its backyard. It is what a city doing things for itself looks like. And it starts neither in the council chamber nor the city centre, but in a knackered hall in Devonport. Dotted across Devonport are the grand Regency buildings that remind visitors of its vast previous wealth and pre-1914 status as an independent town. Most imposing of all is the Guildhall, with its massive Doric pillars. By the mid-2000s, it had lain empty for years, being far too large for the now-shrunken local economy. Then, to councillors’ relief, along came a regional group called the Real Ideas Organisation (Rio).“The conversation began, ‘Do you think it needs to be a community centre, a business centre or an arts centre?’” recalls Rio chief executive Lyndsey Hall. “By the end, it was, ‘We don’t care what you do – just take it away.’” With a £1.75m grant, Hall did just that. Today, it’s not just a centre for community or business or arts: it’s all three – and more. “No one’s going to get rich out of running a building like this,” says Hall’s colleague Ed Whitelaw. “Why would any private company want to take it on?”But Hall and Whitelaw don’t run a standard business. Theirs is a social enterprise, a company that uses its profits and assets for public good. Rio derives an income from the Guildhall, but it doesn’t sweat the building for every last penny.To wander around the Guildhall is to see that ethos in action: the main hall with its stained-glass windows has just been vacated by a team of cheerleaders, and is let out for free to community groups. Other social enterprises rent office space and use the basement jail cells as meeting rooms. In the corner is a cafe and bakery.When the council met Rio in the late 2000s, social enterprises were still a novelty. Hall had been inspired by a visit to Toronto and seeing everything from supermarket chains to the giant Harbourfront arts centre operating as community businesses. But in the UK, social enterprises, or community interest companies, were only legally recognised in 2005. A product of fag-end Blairism, they came bearing that ideology’s virtues and vices: a desire to tackle age-old social problems in new ways and a bewildered wonderment at the magic that could somehow be worked by entrepreneurs. That haze hangs over the 2005 act, which establishes a watchdog for the new businesses – but says its “power should be exercised only to the extent necessary to maintain confidence in community interest companies”. As for how exactly communities were to be served by these companies – well, that was usually left for the companies themselves to define. Whether returning £10m or 10p to society – that’s up to them. “Some social enterprises we go, ‘brilliant, fabulous’,” says Rio’s Hall. “Other things named as social enterprises we go, ‘ugh’.”Yet consider the possibilities that a new form of entrepreneurship offers Plymouth, which faces the same huge challenge as numberless towns and cities across Britain and the west: how to get capital and power to stay local. One answer adopted by Chris Penberthy and the other Labour politicians voted in to lead the council in 2012 was to grow a different kind of business. The next year, Plymouth raced Bristol to become the first social enterprise city in the UK.“How do we grow our economy and grow ourselves a future? By finding companies who will do more than corporate social responsibility,” says Penberthy, who was put in charge of growing social enterprise in the city, a post then unknown to local government.“There was a lot of banging desks and ‘Do it now!’” recalls Alistair Macpherson, who worked at the council for years. In another municipal rarity, Penberthy set up a public fund to kickstart new social enterprises. More than largesse or political vision, this was a way for a local authority with dwindling budgets to fill in the gaps that big business wouldn’t touch.Those gaps are not just the dead buildings brought back to life by Rio, which is now at work on a £7m project to turn Devonport’s abandoned market hall into a high-tech centre for virtual reality. They’re also the solar farm that Macpherson built as head of Plymouth Energy Community on contaminated land next door to a bomb dump. And they’re in the city centre’s abandoned shops, such as the one now occupied by Moments Cafe which, as well as selling mugs of tea and ham omelettes, helps dementia sufferers and their carers. Run by nurse Kate Smith, the cafe’s staff has been trained to look out for memory problems or distress among customers.What drew Luke into the cafe was a sign reading “Memory Matters”. It was like a personal message. Last July, surgeons had removed a brain tumour by cutting out part of a lobe, and now he could no longer remember basic things, whether afternoon plans or people’s names. At the till he didn’t ask for a coffee: “I just wanted a number. A number for me to ring to speak about my memory.”Instead, Kate took him upstairs for a quiet chat – then it all came out. How the tumour meant he’d lost his building business and split from the mother of his four-year-old girl. How his head still hurt so much, despite all the heavy-duty meds. The attempts to kill himself. How the council had stuck him in a house-share with two other men, both threatening to beat him up. How he’d run away, with nowhere else to go. “I just bawled my eyes out,” says Luke, and not because of how much trouble he was in. “It was the acceptance from Kate. She listened and understood.”“You can’t leave him,” Smith remembers thinking to herself. “He’ll die.” So she lobbied council officers, drafted in support from Luke’s doctors, and got him a diary. Flip it open and the pages teem with Smith’s neatly written reminders to visit the hospital, phone the bank. It was a week’s work, reckons Smith. “And the rest,” laughs Luke. It paid off: he is now in a Travelodge while the council sorts out a permanent home. An amazing story, but it leaves you wondering why a just-opened cafe is picking up the pieces dropped by the NHS and the council – and whether tears over coffee and long hours ringing around a civic centre can ever form an actual business model. At the same time, it’s impossible to imagine such stories coming out of the mammoth Costa just a few doors down.Plymouth now has more than 150 social enterprises employing over 7,000 workers earning a combined income of over £500m. For a city of 250,000 people, which only adopted social enterprise five years ago, that’s remarkable growth. Even more surprising is the politics. Political control over Plymouth council changes only slightly less frequently than the tide, yet the Tory administration that took over in 2016 has also encouraged and funded social enterprise. If, as looks likely, Labour returns to power next month, it is committed to doubling the city’s co-operative economy by 2025. With neither side threatening to pull the plug, national charities such as Esmee Fairbairn and Power To Change have the security they need to plough millions into the city’s sector.To see what social enterprise could look like, walk 10 minutes west from Moments Cafe to yet another local graveyard. Once heaving with pubs and clubs, Union Street is now silent and shut. Yet inside The Clipper, once open all hours, Hannah Sloggett and Wendy Hart have plans to open a covered market and turn the two flats above into affordable homes for single fathers who lack the bedrooms for their visiting kids.I’m reminded of a remark from Rio’s Hall. “There was that moment on television when you’d have Alan Sugar doing The Apprentice and getting people to behave as badly as possible. Then an hour afterwards, it’d be The Secret Millionaire – with all these tycoons making people cry by giving them money out of the goodness of their hearts. “And that’s – that’s just wrong!” Her head crashes into her palms. “Why are we creating a culture where it’s OK to make money behaving as badly as possible in order for people to give it away? That’s the culture we’ve got to change. I don’t care whether it’s called social enterprise, or anything else.”Additional reporting by Tom Wright"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54ac2cf84d129f175e53cd45237e2aa555242cd5/181_301_2153_1291/master/2153.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=eea417158952a1face22ba8ac6cd2777 1240w","title":"wedding guest prince harry meghan","story":"Forget all that horse manure about sanctifying your relationship before God and in the presence of your loved ones. The real, practical value of the institution of marriage is that it’s a stress test: if your relationship can survive planning the wedding, you’ll probably make it to the finish line. You’re supposed to invite these ones. It’s kind of the form. Don’t be like the bride I know who caused all sorts of difficulties by asking her husband to uninvite his father on the eve of the wedding. And if you have a big family, you have to be very careful about picking and choosing cousins: branches of families tend to come as a package. If there are relatives you really, really can’t stand, the trick is to invite them, then take revenge with the seating arrangement.This is less likely to apply, obviously, when one of you is a prince and the other a Hollywood star. But that gives you less wriggle room, too. If you’re both only moderately off, and you’re paying for it yourself, less close friends will (mostly) be understanding if they get a tier two, come-for-a-drink-afterwards-but-not-the-three-course-dinner invitation. That’s harder to do if that friend is a world leader. Why is South Korea invited to dinner while the DPRK only gets pints and stovies, the North Korean ambassador might wonder? International incidents have started over less.The number one cause of all premarital rows, and the subject of intense horse-trading. Is it his boorish old drinking buddy who is guaranteed to #MeToo a bridesmaid or crack a vile joke to her father the vicar? Or is it her overemotional schoolmate, who will dominate the karaoke before bursting into tears and making it all about her? Former lovers are a particularly tricky subcategory. “But she’s not just my ex, we’re like, really close friends now.” Or: “OK: write down which of these Cressidas you haven’t banged, right now, or the wedding is off.”It isn’t just exes of the bride and groom who can cause trouble. In any large and longstanding friendship group, there will be personal and romantic tensions. What do you do when your big group of pals from your early 20s contains, say, Mark Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss twins? Or Brad and Jennifer? Or Iran and Israel?Again, a different case if you, the bride and groom, are a bit famous and bring the glamour yourselves. But even if the general idea is to gather together only people who are special to bride and groom, there can be a distinct temptation to use a wedding to shape the friendship group you wish you had, rather than reflect the one you do. But if there’s a one-in, one-out policy, you have to decide between the exciting new friend against the old but boring one who you haven’t seen for a couple of years, but who will still take grave offence if they are not invited.You pretty much have to suck this one up. Unless you’re going to have a blanket no-husbands-and-wives rule, you risk a metaphorical (or, in a royal wedding, a literal) third world war scenario if you explain to someone, however delicately, that you don’t have capacity for plus ones. And a blanket no-partners (or no blanket-partners) rule can cause even more trouble than that. Let’s not even start on whether their children are invited. Remember: five dear friends can quickly turn into 20 or more unwelcome guests.Is there a way around all this? Not if you’re determined to get married, there isn’t. The best you can hope for is the goodwill of those friends who, having been through it themselves, know that you can’t always get it right. If Harry and Meghan don’t invite me, for example, I shall be gracious about it. I know that it’s my wife they can’t stand.• Sam Leith is an author, journalist and literary editor of The Spectator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e03bbd60797530ef17ee2396f14b22fc28f61e88/0_324_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4945b08b6e0b26b730216f5c6771747e 1240w","title":"rules working from home never wear pyjamas","story":"If you’re dressed for bed, your brain will think it’s bedtime. ‘Cheering’ tracksuit bottoms and slim-fit jumpers are far better for your home-working wardrobe, says our fashion guru in her weekly columnI’ve recently started to work from home. What should I wear?Sara, by emailAn excellent question and one I ask myself most days, because I generally work from home and while working from home does remove certain quandaries from your life – such as: “How long can I tolerate this commute until sweet death releases me?” and: “Sweet Jesus, how many times is Geoff from Accounts going to clear his throat, does he have a literal frog down there and, if so, can I go over and pull it out with my fist?” – others take their place. Nature, vacuum, etc.So while I no longer, thank goodness, have to endure the London tube every rush hour, I do find myself facing daily existential questions such as: “How do I stop myself from snacking from the fridge literally all goddamn day?” and: “If I’m not actually leaving the house, do I have to leave my bed?”Questions, questions. Clothing, of course, comes under this umbrella of new questions. Why bother to dress if you’re not going outside? To quote that famous philosophical saying, “If you wear an unironed shirt and no one sees it, was the shirt actually ironed?”The new homeworker tends to go through three phases with their clothes before settling down into something that works. The first is the pyjama phase, when you’re so excited about no longer having to go into an office that you celebrate by staying in your pyjamas for a day, three days, maybe five – what does it matter, right?But the thrill quickly wanes, partly because the postman starts giving you looks (and, as a homeworker, you will now be the drop-off depot for all of your neighbours’ Amazon, Asos, Argos, Ikea, Boots and John Lewis deliveries, so you will see an awful lot of your postman). But mainly because it starts to feel gross. Working in your pyjamas is a lot like working from bed (and the two often go together): it seems like such a great idea when you start, but you realise that if you’re dressed for bed, your brain will thinks it’s bedtime and totally fuzz out. So, not pyjamas is the first rule of homeworking.The next phase is when you react against pyjamas by dressing up – as if you’re going to work. This works for some people. Putting on a suit or smart dress gets them in the work mindset, I guess. I have a friend who likes to work from home in party dresses, as they make her feel like she is a) on it and b) having fun, even though she is sitting in her living room and knocking out more advertising copy.And that’s great – give that a go, see if it works for you. It absolutely never did for me. It just felt silly, as if I was some pathetic character in a movie, possibly one directed by the Coen brothers, who had been sacked and now sat at home in his suit, pretending nothing had happened.So, as I tend to do in all things, I go for the middle option (#centristhomeworker) and dress in clothes that are as comfortable as pyjamas but aren’t actually pyjamas. For me, this means cheering tracksuit bottoms, T-shirts, and slim-fitting jumpers. What do I mean by “cheering tracksuit bottoms”? Glad you asked! Ones that are not shapeless and depressing, but fit nicely, are colourful, and maybe even have rainbow stripes down the side. Asos.com is your answer here, and as you now work from home you’ll be there to accept its deliveries. I find that wearing a slim-fitting jumper – not a massive baggy thing that flops annoyingly over your hands when you’re typing – makes the tracksuit feel a little smarter so your brain doesn’t go into fuzz-out mode.As a kid, when I imagined my adult life, I sort of imagined myself as dressing like Melanie Griffith in Working Girl, striding around in a skirt suit. Instead, I sit around at home all day in a tracksuit. And because I’m such an adult, I’m good with that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18b85d2bea40b32204686cadb02d62239b509275/34_1152_4047_2428/master/4047.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=950d40f0e00e38b92d7fc3740b3c278e 1240w","title":"nicolas cage joker batman gotham","story":"The very good, or very bad actor, depending on your tastes, has said that he would like to play Batman’s nemesis. Will the studios take the bait?If there were ever a Marmite actor, iding opinion equally between those who believe he is a maverick genius and those who see him as a giant ham, it is Nicolas Cage. When the part is right, as it was for Cage’s Oscar-winning role as a suicidal alcoholic in Mike Figgis’s Leaving Las Vegas, or as an unhinged cop in Werner Herzog’s mesmeric Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, he is one of the most watchable actors on the planet. When Cage goes too far out on a limb – one need hardly mention his infamous “The bees!” scene in Neil LaBute’s horrendous 2006 remake of The Wicker Man – it can feel as if he is not only appearing in a completely different movie from those around him, but perhaps inhabiting a parallel acting reality.At least Cage tries things – his decision to channel Adam West as vigilante Big Daddy in the comic book flick Kick-Ass was inspired, and helped mark that movie out from the crowd. The problem is that the things Cage tries are as likely to go wrong as right, and once they have done so there seems to be no off switch. That should perhaps lead us to view with caution the actor’s suggestion this week that he might make a decent Joker in an upcoming Batman movie.With apologies to the Fantastic Four super villain, it’s Cage’s suggestion that he might enjoy getting under the clown prince of Gotham’s skin that has grabbed most of the attention online. There appears to be little in the way of an opening right now at DC, with Jared Leto still inhabiting Batman’s nemesis for the DC Extended Universe movies and Joaquin Phoenix reportedly lined up to take the role in Todd Phillips’s upcoming Martin Scorsese-inspired Joker origin movie. But if DC studio Warner Bros is prepared to undermine Leto by casting another actor in a completely different take on the cackling supervillain, it should hardly be a stretch for studio execs to greenlight a third production.It’s not difficult to see why Cage is drawn to The Joker. For it ought, in theory, to be impossible to overact while playing the role. Not for a moment, we imagine, did Mark Hamill rein himself in while portraying the villain in the wonderful 90s TV show Batman: The Animated Series. Jack Nicholson hardly kept his powder dry for that pantomime turn in Tim Burton’s Batman (1989) and Heath Ledger  put everything on the table in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight (2008). And yet there is a fear that a Cage Joker might sending the movie he appeared in into a ravine. The actor seems too risky a proposition to replace Leto in the DCEU movies, where an unwieldy performance might further derail a cinematic universe. His Doctor Doom would be intriguing, however, and there is space to try for a definitive take on the Fantastic Four’s nemesis. Fargo and Legion’s Noah Hawley is said to be working on an origins story for the supervillain – though it’s unclear whether that production is likely to survive the character’s imminent move from Fox to Disney.It’s hard to imagine the big cheeses at Marvel casting Cage, given the actor’s propensity for eccentric decision-making and the MCU’s episodic nature. Cage as Doom might well become a highlight of the cinematic universe. But it’s just as likely that the star of the Ghost Rider movies would do something characteristically brave and daft at the same time, like deciding to play the part in unwieldy homage to Bela Lugosi (in tribute to Doom’s eastern European origins). That’s something I’m sure we’d all pay good money to see – once. But the novelty might well wear off after another 13 episodes.

Until then, cinemas were a place of dumb, predictable blockbusters. I barely noticed who was directing the films and I didn’t even bother to watch films on TV. Everything changed when, out of complete luck, I happened to see in a short period Reservoir Dogs, Barton Fink, Miller’s Crossing and Bad Lieutenant at a local cinema that held a US indie week at the occasion of the release of Abel Ferrara’s masterpiece. I had no idea that films could be so exciting and different from all the bland soup I was used to, it was a revelation that beyond the box office there was a place for me.” bf_silvertown“Now you’re talking. Two of the most magical times I’ve had in a cinema were watching Murnau’s Sunrise and BrowningChaney’s The Unknown. Perhaps the ultimate decade for horror, which has the peculiarly narcotic feel of dreams, like The Man Who Laughed. Nosferatu stands alone among the versions of the Dracula story. It’s like a stone tape and the memory of it is evocative of something that might perhaps have happened. It was the great decade of physical comedy, with Lloyd and Keaton remaining its peak. But the sadness of 20s film is that so much of it has been lost. How frustrating it is that 4 Devils no longer exists.” MildredPlotka“Silent film of the 20s is when cinema came of age. DW Griffith formulated the alphabet of film in the 1910s, but the Soviets created the syntax of cinema language still used today. There would be no Apocalypse Now (the Kurtz assassination intercut with the water buffalo sacrifice) without Eisenstein’s Strike (“The Carnage” chapter), there would be no Godfather baptism sequence, and hundreds of Potemkin “Odessa steps” references … Soviet montage proved that by image association you can convey complex emotions and engage the viewer intellectually. All that without a single word spoken. Cinema at its purest (albeit propaganda).” Karlos_Nagasaki“Nothing gives me that blast of nostalgia and feeling of escapism like a great 80s movie (I’m 42 now). It’s not just the films themselves but the times that surround them. And the music is like a soundtrack to your childhood. The Beverly Hills Cop theme tune and Eye of the Tiger from Rocky. Not to mention the great John Williams soundtracks. The likes of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Back to the Future are classics in any era, they just take you on a thrill ride and are just perfect examples of a great script, casting and pacing. They definitely don’t make films like that anymore.” McnultyDJW“While the 80s will always be regarded as ridiculous after the sublime heights of the 70s, it actually holds up – probably because of its proximity to the 70s. Lots of films from the 80s that were little-regarded then and are little-remembered now hold up surprisingly well. I’m thinking of films like 48 Hours, Beverley Hills Cop, First Blood, Lethal Weapon, Robocop, They Live, Terminator – considered lowbrow then, but in 2018 seeming gritty, gripping and really well-crafted. Ironically, even the bad films were elevated by the high standards that they represented a decline from.” GRANFALLOON“The more I see films from the 30s, 40s and 50s the more I’m aware that those decades are when pretty much everything we see on screen today was first attempted and, in many cases, perfected. Not just in Hollywood, but all over the world.” alexito“Hadley Freeman wrote that no other decade has made fun movies as brilliantly as the 80s? Try the 1930s, which is basically where every film style covered in her article is sourced from. Lucas, Zemeckis, Hughes, Spielberg etc were obsessed with recreating the decade’s approach to Hollywood entertainment. And they were by no means alone. Check out films from WC Fields, the Marx Brothers, Wheeler and Woolsey, Zazu Pitts and Thelma Todd, the more upmarket screwball comedies (social commentary being central to most of them), Capra’s films, all those action adventure comedies – and then have a look at their 80s stylistic copies.” Splatgadget“How can you discuss the 50s and not mention Ealing Studios? Two of my favourites are The Lady Killers and Kind Hearts and Coronets. If you want to dismiss Ealing films as fluffy, middle-class nostalgia pieces, watch these films. They are wonderfully cynical and dark. Kind Hearts is great social satire. The lead is an awful person but you still feel a pang a sympathy towards him because the way society – and his racist, snobbish family – has screwed him over. Alec Guinness is wonderful in both, playing a demented criminal in the first and seven parts in the second”“One of the things I like about the 40s, pressed between the Hays Office, the need for war propaganda, and the impending McCarthy years, is that film-makers had to work with a limited palette and vocabulary. Rather than coming out and saying something, they had to hint, or concoct allegories. When I was younger, I saw these films in literal terms. Now, it is all innuendo and double entendre.” TomC49“The 40s for me too! Spent a most enjoyable couple of hours last night watching Mildred Pierce for the umpteenth time. It’s been great to be able to collect films I watched for the first time on the BBC years ago. I’ve finally got hold of Beyond the Forest, the film which drove Bette Davis to finally break with Warner Bros: ‘What a dump!’” eileanmor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e6e4d6ac7caf360ee81424318adfca6270069b5/915_14_1605_963/master/1605.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7032ca0a0384624a4da5e64138037549 1240w","title":"humiliation barcelona roma spanish press","story":"The Spanish media, like Barcelona, were struggling to come to terms with the 3-0 defeat at Roma. It was ‘a failure with no excuses’“And the worst thing,” said El Mundo, “is that it was deserved.” The “disaster” – deserved. The “disgrace” – deserved. The “humiliation” – deserved. The “ridicule” – that too. All of it. Barcelona had deserved it all.Roma’s Edin Dzeko, Daniele De Rossi, and Kostas Manolas had as well. All three had scored in the first leg, De Rossi and Manolas in their own goal, and now all three had scored in the second leg, the road leading to redemption and a historic result. The Greek stood, tears welling in his eyes while they went wild at the Stadio Olimpico.As for Barcelona, they have not been back to the semi-final since they won the 2015 Champions League: for a third year in a row, they’ve been knocked out in the quarters. It wasn’t supposed to be this way, not this time. When the draw was made, Sport described it as a “sweetie” before the second leg, 4-1 up, they announced that Barcelona could “touch the semi-final”. It slipped from their hands. Before the game, Ernesto Valverde said his team had to ensure that “nothing extraordinary happens”, but it did. What happened, said Sport, was “a failure with no excuses”. Their cover is black, reserved for days of mourning. It was, the front page said, enough “to make you cry”. “Total failure,” Marca’s front called it. Well, “it”? They. Marca gleefully put Pep Guardiola alongside his former team. They were both out. Everyone expected City to be, at least after Anfield Barcelona were another matter. El Mundo Deportivo called it “the fall of Rome”, Marca called it the “fall of the Barcelona empire” and for AS in the eternal city they had suffered an “imperial failure”, sent falling to earth, in ruins now. Juan Cruz was calling it a “suicide”, in which the people out there were not Barcelona’s players but “ghosts”, and in which by the end they couldn’t cry because there were “no tears left”.If anyone had been lucky, it was Barcelona in the first leg. “Losing is not always a failure, but losing like this is,” wrote Jose María Battle in El Mundo Deportivo. “A team like Barcelona can’t throw a lead like that in the rubbish bin.”Even what lies before them feels like no consolation: 11 points clear at the top of the table and unbeaten, they play the Copa del Rey final next weekend. “This will affect us in the final,” Busquets admitted, sadly. “Hopefully it will not affect us for too long.” Yet it will always be there, most agreed. “This is the biggest humiliation of their contemporary history, after a surreal display,” said El Mundo. “A humiliation that will be remembered for years,” wrote Lluis Mascaró in Sport. “A historic humiliation. Enormous. The kind that hurts. A lot. A hell of a lot.” In Marca, David Sánchez called it a “ridículo mundial”, a humiliation seen around the globe.Ridículo was a word they were all using, but there were others: terrible, dreadful, inexplicable. Or perhaps – and this was the worst thing – not so inexplicable.Valverde said he was “entirely responsible” and fingers pointed his way. Sport highlighted “Valverde’s fear”, Sánchez talked of his “conservatism”, El Mundo noted that the coach had chosen “resistance over control”, and “they couldn’t resist: they didn’t deserve to, either”. They didn’t even compete. One cartoon shows a man in front is his television long after the game. His wife tells him to turn it off, but he replies: “I can’t, I’m waiting for Barcelona to come out on to the pitch.” There was more than just this night, however poor it was. When it has come down to it, away from the Camp Nou, they have had little response of late. Last season they were beaten 4-0 in Paris and 3-0 in Turin. The year before that they were beaten 2-0 in Madrid, against Atlético. Now they have been beaten 3-0 in Rome. They were fortunate to draw 1-1 with Chelsea in London, too, remember. This season, they have kept winning, but they have not always convinced.“Apart from Messi no one is untouchable after this,” said Fernando Polo, but this time some of the focus must fall on him too. It was noted that Barcelona don’t play to Messi’s strengths. It’s more than that: they play to their weaknesses, always giving him the ball in part because there is little else. And maybe that debilitates him, even as it showcases him. It becomes Messi against the world, and the world wins at times. If Messi’s not there, nor are Barcelona – and last night Messi was not there. “He was isolated, it’s true, but he was missed he didn’t turn up,” wrote AS, giving him their “Vaya día” (what a bad day) award.“This was a tragic night, a copy of previous debacles, as if nothing has been leant. It is too easy to just expect an extra-terrestrial to systematically solve the errors of human beings,” said Ernest Folch in Sport. “This should not be treated as a bad day, a one off: they have been playing very little football for a while now, making the most of defensive security and the trump card that is Messi,” said Marca. “The miracle worker was not their saviour this time,” wrote Mascaró. In seven years, supposedly the Messi-era, Barcelona will have won just one European Cup. And this time at least, there could be no complaints, and it was not just chance. “They’re out on merit,” wrote Sport, “their own merit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ca6ee0e8f785bb957dcdf4c9b6f05d73164f87e/0_128_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2a16fbeac1f63c0b968c92f7f384ba38 1240w","title":"barcelona defending champions league","story":"Explain this: Juventus, top of Serie A, having kept clean sheets in 21 of their previous 25 games, horribly defensively exposed by Real Madrid last week, letting in three. And yet last night Roma, third in Serie A, 21 points behind Juve, hammered Barcelona, who remain unbeaten in la Liga and stand 15 points clear of fourth-placed Real Madrid. How can this be?Eusebio Di Francesco, rightly, took credit for his switch to a back three. “I made this choice,” the Roma coach explained, “to create more width, allow more counterattacks and bring speed, but what really changed was the philosophy of the side.” Roma pressed ferociously from the first minute and that unsettled Barça, who are not used to facing sides that take them on and perhaps had made the mistake of thinking the tie was won.The match-up of shapes felt oddly old-fashioned. By the late 80s, the logic was that, all else being equal, 3-5-2 had an advantage over 4-4-2, provided the wing-backs could drive back the opposing wide midfielder, because that left a side three against two in their defensive zone and three against two in midfield while still keeping two forwards up to pressure the opposing centre-backs.That difficulty in controlling midfield was one of the main reasons 4-4-2 fell from favour, although it could still work if the defensive and midfield lines remained very compact, denying the opposition space either by sitting deep or pushing high up the pitch, particularly if, as Barcelona do, the wide midfielders play narrow, tucking in to help with the issue of overmanning in the centre. But that requires discipline and energy, and that was where Barça were lacking.Daniele De Rossi, now 34, operated in a deep-lying playmaker role for Roma. Even protected by Kevin Strootman and Radja Nainggolan, he was somebody Barça had to close down, the obvious fulcrum. Yet just six minutes in, he had all the time in the world, Luis Suárez and Messi casually trotting back to halfway, to float a ball over the defensive line for Edin Dzeko to open the scoring.Gerard Piqué and Samuel Umtiti looked uncomfortable all night against a genuine front two. This was old-school one-on-one defending, not the modern style in which one defender disrupts and the spare man picks up the loose ball. Dzeko, aggressive and relentless, had a superb game.But by far the biggest issue was Barça’s laxity. As with Juve, the warning signs had been there in the previous round. Chelsea, again and again, especially in the first leg, had got a run at an exposed defensive line as the back of Barcelona’s midfield dematerialised. In part that is to do with the waning powers of Sergio Busquets, whose lack of pace is even more pronounced now than it always was, but mainly it is to do with structure.The flaws that were exposed by PSG (in the first leg) and Juve last season have not been resolved. This is Barça gone old and, perhaps more worryingly, gone complacent. The seed of celebrity and inidualism planted by the formation of the MSN forward line has borne a bitter fruit.This is the age of football’s decadence, in which teams can dominate their domestic league – Barça are still unbeaten in Spain – so absolutely that they forget what it is to fight. There is now no more statistic more misleading for a top side, not even possession, than goals conceded: Barça this season have let in 16 in 31 in the league this season, Juve 18 in 31, Manchester City 24 in 32. All of them, when it came to actually defending against a top side, have been found wanting.Yet the trend persists there. In the past eight seasons, 21 of 104 games in the quarter-finals or later have finished with a winning margin of three or more in the eight seasons before that there were only eight. Of the six games played at that stage so far this season, four have been won by three goals or more.Nobody can defend. Small teams are overwhelmed, but so too are bigger sides. In part, it is probably to do with law changes it is much harder now to kill a game by spoiling than it has ever been before. And in part, it is to do with the focus on defenders who can play the ball rather than necessarily being able to defend. But mainly it seems an issue of self-indulgence, of big teams gone to fat on the easy pickings of domestic leagues in which their financial might makes them untouchable.Make the Champions League less predictable, we asked, and suddenly it has become wildly unpredictable, yet still we look on sternly: it has become unpredictable for all the wrong reasons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25d227c0f56aa02b19f52bda1aad6678f94afc72/370_14_1175_705/master/1175.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=aeee67bd1d70d97a6c328c5ff1e69d14 1240w","title":"chris coleman seinfeld sunderland","story":"If we had to slap a name on this era in football, we could do worse than the Rise of the Quants. These days, there is a widespread belief that even the mascot needs to have read Moneyball, and not simply be able to critique the movie. The biggest clubs employ armies of data analysts, while advanced metrics and tactical analytics are the adornment of increasing amounts of commentary. Privately, you might think some of your friends speak the language of football statistics much as Andy Gray once spoke the language of Spanish, when he inquired of a La Manga hotel receptionist: “Eh senoreo, where’s the fucking taxio?” But like Andy, they certainly have a go, and forcefully so.In this occasionally stifling and frequently deeply boring atmosphere, it’s refreshing to hear of idiosyncratic tactical approaches. All respect to Chris Coleman, then, who this week gave the media a glimpse into his forward planning. “We just need to look and see what’s happened in the last five years,” the Sunderland manager explained, “and then do the opposite.”Obviously, Coleman was not being completely serious but there was something cheerily liberated about his comments. Liberation is what he is aiming for, what with Sunderland trapped in the Championship relegation zone. Perhaps Chris will turn out to be a counterculture hero – football’s equivalent of The Diceman, the protagonist of Luke Rhinehart’s cult anti-analysis novel, who makes all his decisions on the throw of a dice.An even closer analogue to the Sunderland manager’s “do the opposite” approach exists. There’s a Seinfeld episode called The Opposite, where George Costanza bemoans what feels like a lifelong losing streak. “It became very clear to me sitting out there today,” he tells Jerry and Elaine, “that every decision I’ve ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat … It’s all been wrong.”“If every instinct you have is wrong,” reasons Jerry, not entirely reasonably, “then the opposite would have to be right.” George duly decides to fight his natural impulses and see what happens, and is immediately rewarded when a beautiful woman agrees to a date, despite the fact he introduced himself to her with the words: “I’m unemployed and live with my parents.”As Coleman freely admits, this will basically be Sunderland’s approach to potential new signings – we’ve got a wantaway owner and you need to take a guess what ision we’ll be playing in next season.It’s not just fictional sitcom characters failing to give absolute primacy to tactical science, though – real football people are at it too. A year or so ago, the Borussia Mönchengladbach coach Dieter Hecking let daylight in on magic when he said tactics were important “but you must not make any secret science out of it”. Many of the secrets that observers scientifically ined each week were quite beyond him. “Today there are even websites, presenting alleged thoughts of us coaches after the game,” Hecking marvelled. “I have read them once after a Wolfsburg game. I was wondering: ‘Am I supposed to have come up with these highly complex things?’”Soon after, the German FA’s head of coaching education, Frank Wormuth, declared tactics “overrated” and less important than the quality of players. Wormuth compared the fetishisation of modern tactical analysis to some pretentious art exhibition preview, “where people are seized by a canvas with colour patches, wondering what the painter wanted to tell them, and afterwards pay a lot of money for it. What did the painter want to tell us? Nothing. Perhaps he had just had a bad day.”At the England level, we are always encouraged to believe we have come a long way technically in the past 25 years or so. At the start of our journey, horrified documentary viewers were able to watch Graham Taylor’s tactical plan unfold as he judged a game was “made for Wrighty”, or bellowed rhetorically: “Can we not knock it?” At the end of our journey, we were deep in the realms of the FA elite development director Dan Ashworth’s spreadsheets. And yet, looking at England’s last major tournament exit to Iceland, you could be forgiven for thinking we had perhaps not journeyed anywhere at all but were simply knowing the place for the first time.As for Coleman’s do-the-opposite dossier, how might it pan out? I’m not sure if one is permitted to run so-called spoilers to Seinfeld episodes – the other day a chap wrote crossly to me saying I’d spoiled a plot point of Return of the Jedi (1983) for him, because he’d only got up to Star Wars: A New Hope (1977).But let’s live dangerously: at the end of The Opposite, George gets a coveted sporting job of his own, hired by the New York Yankees. The next episode opens with him offering batting advice and, though it’s not explicitly clear this is the continuation of do-the-opposite policy, George promptly approaches management with a creatively destructive scheme. The Yankees, he says, would be advantaged by switching from playing in polyester uniforms to cotton. Unfortunately, the cotton kits shrink, the Yankees end up running like penguins, and … well, spoilers. A reminder that asking: “What’s the worst that can happen?” is tempting fate in sport, and we can only hope Coleman’s convention-bucking goes better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e14114272ef9c885f24bfbefa2c7652746f288cf/0_227_4832_2899/master/4832.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8e8e241a85d832e2d18a60071b8fae6e 1240w","title":"liverpool jurgen klopp more than cheerleader champions league manchester city","story":"The Liverpool dressing room was a predictably emotional place around 8.30pm on Tuesday, after a first half in which their passiveness and Manchester City’s excellence had threatened their hold on the Champions League quarter-final. However, while elsewhere in the Etihad Stadium Pep Guardiola was combusting and getting himself sent to a padded seat, Jürgen Klopp was silent. He had a 5-1 aggregate victory over the finest team in the land to plot.Klopp the gurning, manic cheerleader is an image the Liverpool manager regrettably accepts he cannot shake but, as Virgil van Dijk said before the second leg: “He is much more than that.” Another demonstration that teams do not reach the last four of European football’s elite competition on pure emotion was served at half-time at the Etihad. Klopp initially let his players do the talking, or the shouting in Dejan Lovren’s case. “I told the lads to wake up because it was not good enough and I said we were sitting too deep,” the Croatia international said after one of the most commanding nights of his Liverpool career.His manager listened, waited for order to descend on the dressing room and began his tactical instructions for the second half with some pointed advice for Lovren. “Yes we are sitting too deep,” Klopp said, “because you are not pushing up.” The central defender elaborated: “He wanted me and Virg to be more compact and push the team up but it was quite difficult to push up when City had the ball. It was all positive, nothing negative, but I needed to remind the guys that we had 50 minutes to be in the semi‑finals of the Champions League and we needed to give more. The first 10-15 minutes wasn’t good enough. When you see the second half, again they had a couple of chances but nothing too serious. We did much better in the second half – we were higher, we were much more compact and we were better organised defensively.”City, without their conductor on the sidelines for guidance, still managed seven attempts on goal in the second half – 13 in the first – but found no way to add to Gabriel Jesus’s second-minute opener. Liverpool had three after half-time and converted two.Klopp’s team were evidently more clinical in both games but also more disciplined, organised and mature. Of course they had luck, too, especially between the 41st and 42nd minutes of the second leg when Bernardo Silva struck a post and Leroy Sané’s tap-in was wrongly disallowed for offside, changing the complexion of the tie and that of the City manager.In a contest billed as the calm, brilliant precision of the Premier League champions-elect versus the ferocity of Klopp’s attacking game, it was Liverpool who displayed the former, and more besides. Had they beaten the runaway leaders of the Spanish or German league 5-1 on aggregate there might be wider recognition of what Liverpool’s former European Cup-winning captain Phil Thompson called “one of the great European results in our history”. As Lovren put it: “When you concede one goal and score five against Manchester City, I think we should respect Liverpool more.”Liverpool are unbeaten and the highest scoring team in this season’s Champions League. The versatility they displayed over two legs against Guardiola’s side also bodes extremely well for what lies ahead on the road towards the final in Kiev. Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané dropped deep and wide to create a five-man midfield as the visitors regained their composure and executed Klopp’s second-half gameplan to perfection on Tuesday. His defence, as per the instruction to Lovren and Van Dijk, was far more compact. Encouragingly for Klopp, the shape of his team changed around the half-hour mark as players took responsibility for combating City’s breathless approach.“It was a difficult situation for us in the second minute but I was calm,” Lovren said of Gabriel Jesus’s early goal for City. “If I’m not calm then we have a big problem. We talked on the pitch, a few of us, and said: ‘We need to keep our heads and stick together because this is a crucial moment and if we are not calm we will concede another one.’ To concede such a quick goal was not what we wanted but maybe it acted as a wake-up call for us. We had luck, we had luck in a couple of moments to be honest, but when you look over the two games we have been brave and when you are brave the luck goes with you.”Lovren looked forward to next season in the aftermath of Liverpool’s third consecutive victory over City – Klopp’s eighth win in 14 matches against Guardiola – and insisted the Premier League title race will be much closer. “It was weird this season because we didn’t catch up well from the beginning,” he said. “I’m definitely confident that next season we can push everyone, even ourselves to do better, from the beginning to the end.”Next season can wait. Europe is again full of possibilities for Liverpool, improving Liverpool, in the present. The Croat added: “The competition is wide open and anything is possible now. From a personal point of view I don’t want Real Madrid in the semi-finals. They have a lot of experience in the Champions League, a lot of records and over the past three seasons it is always them, but whoever we get will find it difficult to come to Anfield and score.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/779abe9155a59be04bd7db92ecbbf0c284bf39bf/760_393_4364_2617/master/4364.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5a9ffeaa23822d761cdf4f94f0076ff8 1240w","title":"stevenage dino maamria manager interview","story":"Almost three weeks into the job, Dino Maamria is at ease, sat in his manager’s office at Stevenage’s training ground, charting his ambitions for a club close to his heart and telling his fascinating story. It is tale of determination, how, as a teenager from Gafsa, in south-west Tunisia, on the edge of the Sahara desert, he realised his dream of becoming a footballer, and now, having earned his stripes in the non-league game, he is carving out a reputation as a manager.A gregarious character, Maamria, a former striker for Stevenage and the former assistant manager under Graham Westley, makes compelling company over an hour’s conversation, much of which revolves around his unorthodox journey to England, including how Brian Miller, the former Burnley scout on holiday at the time, offered him a two-week trial after spotting him playing against Étoile Sportive du Sahel, a team from Sousse, a tourist resort in the north.Maamria was playing for La Marsa, near Tunis, on the back of another trial, afforded to him after a lorry driver parking up overnight at the nearby wheat factory scribbled his name on the back of a matchstick box. “I was playing, bare feet as a 15- or 16-year-old. Somebody approached me and said: ‘Can I have your name please?’” He has not looked back since arriving at Turf Moor 23 years ago.“From a very young age, I wanted to be a footballer,” he says. “My teacher would have a go at me for saying that because they thought I should be a doctor or something. When I told people I was going to be a footballer, they laughed. I get it, those people who said I had no chance, because at that time there was no chance to go from the desert to the city – to be at one of the top clubs, it was impossible.”The youngest of seven siblings – he has five brothers and one sister – his upbringing was tough (they would run the 20-mile round trip to school in Lalla) – but one of which he is proud. “I came from a very poor background, I was born in a tent … but there is no shame in that. I lived in a tent until I was four, so that tells you where I have come from. We used to share a bed, my brothers and me, we would top and tail. Yes, I was poor but I loved it and I wouldn’t swap it for the world.“As a boy, I lived in a tent with a couple of goats, and one of them I used to call Gary, because of Gary Lineker. It is normal to have goats or camels in the south of Tunisia, where it’s very dry and they can survive the heat and go without drinking for days. We would use the goat’s milk for breakfast. Leo now, my little boy, I tell him about the story and he always says: ‘Daddy I want a goat for my birthday.’ I take him and my daughter, Maya, home every year to see my family and all the rest of it.”His late father, Youssef, worked in the phosphate mines – “a dangerous job that did not pay a lot” – but it was a conversation he overheard between his mother, Zara, and a neighbour, a couple of weeks before his baccalaureate exams, that spurred him. “They asked: ‘Why is he not studying and revising like everybody else?’ My mum said: ‘He is going to be a footballer.’ My neighbour laughed at her, I always remember that and that gave me that drive.”Maamria has always been captivated by football, inspired since he was a seven-year-old hearing history on the radio from the 1978 World Cup, Tunisia’s maiden appearance in the finals. His bold smile broadens as he rattles off their results with pride, particularly that 0-0 draw with West Germany. “We played on dirt tracks, wherever we could, with rocks either side – that was our goals. Tunisia is a third-world country but we are obsessed with football. North Africa is mad about football: Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Egypt, there is a big rivalry. Growing up, they were big games.

In Tunisia there is a coffee culture but in Burnley everywhere was shut at 5pm. I was like: ‘What is going on here, it is 5pm, and for us it is just the start of the evening.’ So, I had to go to the pub to have a cup of coffee and people were looking at me funny.”A thirst to learn meant Maamria started his coaching badges in his mid-20s while out with a broken leg at Burnley. He worked with Jay Rodriguez and Richard Chaplow, all the time improving his language skills. After Northwich Victoria, Southport and Nuneaton Town – whom he left to return to Stevenage last month – Maamria is relishing his fourth manager’s job and the task at hand at a club 15th in League Two. “I am quite proud because I am probably the first African and the first Muslim to be a manager in the Football League.

It focuses on spending aimed at children aged from birth to six years old. “Benefits of investing in pre-primary education are found to be the greatest for the most disadvantaged, who are often the least prepared when starting primary school and are therefore most likely to be left behind,” said Sarah Brown, president of Theirworld. “But despite all the evidence, millions of children are continuing to miss out on the chance of a great start in life.” Campaigners have warned repeatedly that education projects are severely underfunded, and those for early years even more so. In February, at a global summit, world leaders promised to spend $2.3bn (£1.6bn) on education over the next three years, following warnings from the World Bank of a “global learning crisis”. But donor pledges fell short of the $3bn target given by the Global Partnership for Education.

Persil and Ariel have been accused of selling a less effective washing product formula in eastern Europe, a claim they also refute.The European commission will next month provide member states with a methodology for testing multinational brands, so that the real culprits can be identified. Funding has also been committed.Company response: “The tastes and consumer wishes are different in each country and we try to fulfil consumer wishes.”Test result:\u0026nbspMeat in German can was found to be pork, while Czech product was mechanically extracted poultry meat.Company response: “The two products mentioned are different products. Yes, the products look a bit like each other at first glance, but they are not at all similar – different layout, different recipes. The German\u0026nbspFrühstücksfleish\u0026nbspis a completely different recipe than the Czech and Slovenian luncheon meat.”Company response: It said its recipes for fish fingers were adapted to local tastes but they were all made in Germany, including those sold in the UK.Test result:\u0026nbspFructose-glucose syrup and 11.2g of sugar in bottle sold in Slovenia, compared with 10.6g of sugar in Austria.Company response: “We occasionally slightly adapt our beverages to meet local consumer tastes and preferences, to source local ingredients or to follow local regulation.”However, Věra Jourová, the most senior justice official at the European commission, who is responsible for consumer affairs, said central and eastern European governments, including in her home state, the Czech Republic, needed to see explicit legislation outlawing the practice, which has now been drafted.Jourová said she had faced resistance from industry and western member states who incorrectly believed the EU was seeking to harmonise food products.She said: “The industry is nervous ... There is some misunderstanding between some parts of Europe that the problem is not that serious. Colleagues in trade and industry had legitimate concerns that we must not open the Pandora’s box but I think we have come forward with a proportionate solution.“We are not dictating tastes. I am not touching Danish herrings, I am not touching Czech sausages. If there exists a brand that is marketed in many member states, there is legitimate expectation that the brand will contain the same thing, and it doesn’t in cases ... My estimation remains the same – several hundreds of products.”She added: “I am not friendly towards legislation when there are other ways to do the same thing. But I have received very clear responses from the member states that they want to see this in legislation.”Products with different recipes, but bearing the same branding, will only be allowed on sale if the food company can prove through surveys that the taste preferences in one part of Europe differ from those in another area.The action against the “dual food” problem was among a series of efforts to increase consumer confidence announced in Brussels.Jourová said: “In a globalised world where the big companies have a huge advantage over inidual consumers, we need to level the odds. Consumer authorities will finally get teeth to punish the cheaters. It cannot be cheap to cheat.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a371f1815b56f944f6e1abbecb4329aad408c7c/0_1289_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=93f0cc30a8db9485653627f98add0249 1240w","title":"omar allibhoy recipe cauliflower garlic vinegar capers","story":"This simple tapa from the Tapas Revolution founder is the Spanish version of a stir-fry.

In an exclusive extract from his new book, he writes about the power of storytelling and the eureka moment behind the party’s 2017 campaign sloganAs Jeremy Corbyn was campaigning to be Labour leader for the first time in 2015, something unprecedented was happening in the US: a democratic socialist was emerging as a serious contender for the presidency. Never in US political history had someone labelling themselves with the “S” word been more than a fringe candidate.Hillary Clinton had name recognition, huge resources, and the backing of the entire Democrat establishment. However, she had alienated many grassroots Democrat supporters with her backing for regime-change wars and trade deals that had decimated entire industries and destroyed thousands of jobs.Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, had voted against the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and was challenging her with a campaign platform that – like Corbyn’s – zeroed-in on growing wealth inequality. Sanders reiterated that core message in rally after rally through the summer and autumn of 2015. And it soon became clear he was striking a chord with voters.By 2016 I wanted to see what it was like to #FeelTheBern. And I was not disappointed. The rally I attended – on 4 June, on the concourse of the Los Angeles Coliseum – was slickly organised. Staff and volunteers managed security as more than 13,000 people queued patiently to pass through the barriers. There were three hours of music and speeches by Hollywood A-listers – among them Rosario Dawson, Shailene Woodley, Max Carver and, my own favourite, 90-year-old Dick Van Dyke “giving a young politician a hand-up” by leading a “we love you, Bernie” sing-along. By the time Sanders made his entrance, the event was all over Twitter and the anticipation was huge. Flanked by his wife, Jane, and his children and grandchildren, he spoke from a lectern decorated with a US flag and the campaign’s “a future to believe in” strapline, and stuck to a text that embodied the arguments he had been repeating at every single rally for months. There was no message-creep and no need for him to shout – every word would be of broadcast quality for mainstream media and live streaming online.Afterwards I was not alone among Corbyn’s supporters in reflecting on what Labour could learn from the Sanders campaign. Not only was there considerable common ground on policy, they were both “anti-establishment” politicians who had the authenticity and credibility, on the one hand, to counter the rightwing populism of Donald Trump and Nigel Farage and, on the other, to inspire and mobilise young people on a scale not seen for a generation.However, importing ideas from another country, even one with a nominally common language, is a hazardous business. Some ideas do not travel well. Sometimes good ideas are dismissed because of where they have come from.When Bill Clinton emerged to win the 1992 presidential election, the Labour modernisers fell in love with American politics. They saw Clinton’s “new” Democrats, with their focus on appealing to middle-class aspiration, as the model for New Labour. The one thing they expressly did not acquire from Clinton was his liking for campaign rallies. Bill is a charming and engaging orator who loves a big crowd, but New Labour had a strong aversion to political rallies, dismissing them as preaching to the converted. Which is all very well if the media is on your side, but for politicians challenging the status quo, every opportunity to speak to large numbers of people directly is like gold dust.Sanders had made a virtue of necessity in building his campaign around big rallies that were welcoming to people new to politics. Looking back on it afterwards, he wrote: “A rally of thousands of people standing together … is something unforgettable and extraordinarily powerful. It is not something that a television ad can accomplish.”The rallies were a generator that powered all the other elements, creating virtuous circles of highly charged activity. Videos would be shared far and wide on social media. New volunteers signed up at rallies would be trained to go out canvassing. Contact details collected would be used to disseminate campaign materials and raise money online.Mass fundraising from small donors was one of the stand-out features of the Sanders campaign. At the outset, he had decided that “you cannot take on the establishment if you take their money.” Sanders was also adept at using social media, despite personally being a novice.But he was not dismissive of conventional methods. He had used paid-for radio, television and print advertising in numerous previous election campaigns and believed it still played an important role. In his bid for the presidency, as his support grew, he was able to compete with Clinton on paid advertising. By the end, the Sanders campaign had spent more than $100m on media buying. What distinguished his use of a conventional medium, however, was the way his ads – in both their imagery and words – were mainly about people and their stories. While the Clinton campaign was running traditional candidate messages, focusing on her political record, the Sanders ads were – as marketing agency executives put it – “tapping into what people are feeling” and offering “a deeper sense of idealism”.At Westminster, as the end of March 2017 approached, the inspiring Sanders rally I had gone to felt very distant. The local elections were looming. Campaign materials had to be produced within a matter of days, and our plans to get a policy bandwagon rolling had been delayed by the horrific Westminster Bridge attack. In the discussions with Southside, Labour’s head office near Victoria, during that period, there was much rolling of eyes when I offered some thoughts on how we should campaign in the local elections. I had half-expected my references to the Sanders campaign to be dismissed, and they were (“he lost,” I was told), but I had not bargained for the amusement use of the phrase “narrative arcs” would cause.Storytelling has been used in marketing communications for years, simply because it is how most of us talk to each other most of the time – we tell people about things that have happened to us or others and then we might discuss what we feel or think about them. Conversation is mainly storytelling. And so is the best political communication, which is why some of the Sanders videos were so effective, and why the leader of the opposition’s office – known by the acronym Loto – had already accepted a kind offer from the film director Ken Loach to use his skills.But this goes wider than how you produce a video. The whole campaign needed to tell the same story – an overarching narrative that voiced people’s fears, frustrations and hopes, and described a road to a better future. In a dishonest way, the big personalities of neo-liberalism, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, were ahead of the curve on this. Their narrative triumphed for a generation because they convinced enough people that public spending and trade unions were to blame for the economic woes that hit capitalism in the 1970s, and that the private sector, set free to operate in de-regulated global markets, would create wealth and affluence.But, if I was ever frustrated by some of those early discussions, one thing that would always lift my spirits was the irrepressible activity of what were known in Loto as “Jeremy’s outriders”. There were dozens of them on Twitter and Facebook who, day in and day out, were pumping out great material exposing the Tories and putting across many of our arguments. I include in this organised groups such as JeremyCorbyn4PM and Momentum, but mostly they were people acting on their own initiative out of sheer personal commitment. When the election was called a month or so later, they would play a crucial role. The Tories had nothing like it. Since the election, they had produced a “digital toolkit”, but Peter Stefanovic – a lawyer who had given up his day job to spend a year campaigning, and one of the outriders I had most contact with – thought it lacked a crucial ingredient: “The difference is that we believe passionately in what we’re doing, in the manifesto, in the principles behind it and how it’s going to change the country. You can’t manufacture that belief.”Stefanovic is a natural communicator with a knack for finding the right words to make a point or, dare I say it, tell a story. If this was easy, more people would be good at it. But language is a complicated thing. And the Sanders campaign was not so helpful in this respect. Some of their terms could be imported – a “rigged” system was one we used – but George Bernard Shaw was right when he said the US and Britain are two countries disunited by a common language. Corbyn could not say he would “stand up for Main Street against Wall Street” and “fight for the shrinking middle class” without confusing everyone.Among British political terms, I felt the phrase “left behind” presented some problems. In a note to Seumas Milne, the director of strategy and communications, before I started as his deputy in the leader’s office, I said I thought it was isive. Ukip and far-right newspapers such as the Daily Express were using “left behind” to pit predominantly white working-class communities against a so-called liberal metropolitan elite. In using “left behind” we were actually reinforcing the false idea that the only people left behind are in Brexit-leaning areas where traditional industries have been decimated. Who is most “left behind”: a young person in Islwyn who can’t get a job, or a young person in Islington who can’t afford the rent on a bedsitter, never mind buy their own home? Globalisation destroys jobs in some parts of the country and inflates house prices in others. “Left behind” pits its victims against each other. Which, of course, is why Farage and co use it.Milne and I were agreed on this, and he had already started discussing these narrative issues with two consultants, Marc Lopatin and Jem Bendell. In a blog a few months earlier, they had argued that Theresa May had “put her tanks on Labour’s lawn” by kicking off her premiership with “a spot of cross-dressing” in her pitch to ordinary working-class families. To respond, Labour needed to create a “permission space” with voters who weren’t listening to us because the Tories had been successful in blaming us for the deficit.Arguing that tactics and language had to be “fit for purpose,” they had said: “And that purpose is securing votes. So, while Corbyn’s ultimate vision involves stirring a lost spirit of solidarity and community, Labour must embrace voters as they find them and design conversations accordingly. Because the prize is bigger than reconnecting with former Labour heartlands. When Mrs May references working-class families as ‘just getting by,’ she also knows that millions of families higher up the income ladder identify themselves in the very same terms.“So, when Labour speaks, it needs to explain how government has been failing families across the board and how this can be fixed ... If Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership can lift its gaze beyond the food bank, the government will have a fight on its hands.”I did not see austerity as only being about food banks – or its other extreme manifestations, such as homelessness – but was that the impression we were giving?Jon Trickett, meanwhile, had prepared a paper for the Loto strategy group that overlapped with these discussions. Trickett is one of Corbyn’s closest allies and brings to the table not only the insights of an MP from a northern seat – Hemsworth in West Yorkshire – but also a searching political mind that looks beyond what’s going on in the trenches. Trickett’s paper emphasised the need for Labour to create “a majoritarian coalition” around a “transformational” offer rather than use “retail” politics to appeal to different interest groups. When a general election came, we should make it about the kind of country we wanted to build and why it would serve the interests of the great majority of people, not only those experiencing the most acute symptoms of Tory policies.In time, Lopatin and Bendell would propose replacing “left behind” with “held back”. “Held back” could be applied to a whole range of ways in which most people’s lives are limited by a society run for the rich. We saw it as majoritarian and unifying – it spoke to both sides of the Brexit ide. More than that, it implies a call to action: whereas “left behind” encourages people to think of themselves as victims, “held back” suggests an obstacle to be removed. It prompts questions: what is holding me back, why and how can I do something about it? There was a story emerging here – and, like the best stories, a contradiction that required resolution. Looking back on it, we were all inching towards an approach that would gel around “for the many, not the few” – a suggestion that did not surface until the first full day of the general election campaign.The pressure on Milne and me to make a decision was intense because leaflets were going to print and artwork was needed for the campaign bus. That afternoon, Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) was due to gather for a scheduled meeting and would expect our presentation to answer this most basic of questions. The strapline we had used for the local elections – “standing up for you” – was designed to position candidates as champions of their communities, but it was not applicable to a campaign aiming to win power at Westminster and deliver fundamental change. The idea of people being “held back” was already built into our narrative, as was juxtaposing “a society rigged for the rich” against “one in which people could lead richer lives”. But the two campaign co-ordinators, Ian Lavery and Andrew Gwynne, were still deeply unhappy about any use of “rich” or “richer”, which had been misinterpreted by some of the participants when tested at focus groups, and almost everything else we toyed with seemed lame and unoriginal.As I pressed on with writing the presentation for the NEC, Milne went to see Gwynne and Lavery to listen to their concerns and discuss other options. The meeting was inconclusive, but Gwynne came back to Loto to continue the brainstorm with Milne by running through past Labour straplines and discussing which ones had worked and which hadn’t. They agreed the 2005 motto “Britain forward, not back” was the worst they could remember, with the 2015 effort “better plan for a better future” not very far behind.As they delved deeper into the past, the words “the many, not the few” from the party’s constitution came up. The phrase was part of a new version of clause IV proposed by Tony Blair and adopted at a special conference in 1995 to replace Labour’s longstanding commitment to “common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange”. The dropping of the old clause IV was opposed by those of us who saw it as a New Labour move to distance the party from the idea of public ownership. However, the new clause contained phrases that are common ground for all its members, among them the words adapted from Shelley’s poem Masque of Anarchy. It was written in 1819 following the Peterloo massacre at St Peter’s Field, Manchester, when cavalry charged into a crowd of tens of thousands who were demanding the right to vote. For Milne, it felt right to use them again in a different context, and Gwynne agreed.By now it was nearly midday, and my NEC presentation still had a big hole in it. When I scurried into Milne’s room, he said: “What do you think of ‘for the many, not the few’?” It was one of those FFS moments when you realise there’s a good reason why some things stand the test of time – in this case, nearly 200 years. With the word “for” added, the phrase encapsulated the idea of building a society that serves the great majority and not accepting one that is run by and for a privileged elite. It went beyond modifying the way the country is run by making it “fairer” or “better” and implied a transformation to a wholly different way of doing things.Of course, the fact that Blair had used the words complicated this interpretation. Would some people consider it sullied? How could the same slogan apply to a “centrist” platform – whose proponents were “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich” – as well as our much more radical one? We hardly had any time to debate these doubts, but would the vast majority of voters know or care about them anyway? My instinct was that most people would not be aware of how “the many, not the few” had been used before and those who did would realise Corbyn – of all people – truly meant the message it embodied.• Extracted from Game Changer: Eight Weeks that Transformed British Politics, published by Accent Press on 18 April (£15.99).

From flattened ears to affectionate bum-flashing, a cat behaviouralist reveals what it all meansAs the first cat was domesticated more than 4,000 years ago, you’d think we’d have them figured out by now. But no. We still expect them to fit in with our modern lives with zero compatibility issues, despite the fact that cats are fundamentally solitary hunters so naturally they behave differently – it’s in their DNA. To hone your animal instincts, animal behaviourist, cat expert and author Anneleen Bru decodes cat behaviour for beginners.What they do: rub around your legsWhat it means: ‘I feel good’“Often a cat will do this if you are preparing their food,” says Bru. “It means: ‘I like this person, I feel safe, I’m happy.’”Cats use pheromones in a very clever way – think of it as leaving scented Post-It notes around their core living space. Rubbing against certain furniture is reinforcing a message that it’s their happy place.What they do: flash their bumWhat it means: ‘I like you’When a cat flashes its derriere to another cat they are being really welcoming.“It’s their way of saying to another cat: ‘Hello, I like you,’” explains Bru. “So, when they do that to us, their humans, it means the same thing.”What they do: purrWhat usually means: ‘I’m happy and chilled’What it sometimes means: ‘I’m stressed and in pain’“Mostly, purring is pure contentment, but sometimes it can be a sign of stress, anxiety, or illness. Cats don’t show pain, but they exhibit subtle changes in their behaviour instead. In these instances, purring offers relief to an anxious or stressed cat, in effect they are trying to self-soothe.”Tip: If your cat has always purred and stops, see a vet as it could indicate a health issue. Equally, if it doesn’t normally purr, but starts, see your vet. Any sudden behaviour changes could be a sign your cat needs veterinary treatment.What they do: sleep in weird placesWhat it means: ‘I’m keeping myself safe’“As a solitary hunter, cats like to sleep up high so they are safe and aware of their surroundings,” says Bru. “Sleeping up high, or in hidden places, like cardboard boxes or in cupboards or drawers, is in their DNA. It’s how they survive. Let them do it.”What they do: padWhat it means: ‘I’m chilling and really enjoying myself’“This is real self-soothing behaviour that goes back to kittenhood,” says Bru. “It’s the action that kittens do to release the milk at their mother’s teats, often this action can send them into a real trance and cats will do this until their final years. It’s the epitome of a happy cat.”What they do: close their eyes, while sitting close to youWhat it means: ‘I love you’“This is the equivalent of a cat’s kiss,” says Bru. “If you open your eyes wide and close them while looking at your cat, it’s telling them you love them back. It’s cat whispering. Try it.”What they do: flatten their whiskersWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’Whiskers are super-sensitive radar devices for cats as they struggle to focus on anything an arm’s length from their face. Their long, coarse whiskers have highly sensitive nerve endings at the roots – they can determine if prey is close by and what space is around them.What they do: stare at other catsWhat it means: ‘I hate them’“This is the feline equivalent of giving the other the middle finger,” says Bru. “Don’t ever think that two cats staring at each other is going to lead to anything gentle. It won’t.”What they do: drop their tailWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’“A straight up tail, or one held in a question-mark shape, is the sign of a happy cat,” says Bru. “This is the complete opposite.”What they do: flatten their earsWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’ (sensing a pattern?)The most obvious sign you have an unhappy cat. Combine it with an arched back, bushy coat, flattened ears, erect bushy tail, deep moaning and you have a very, very grumpy cat.What they do: pee in your trainersWhat it means: ‘You need to sort out my litter tray situation’“In the wild, cats will pee and poo in different places,” explains Bru. “A cat is programmed to bury its poo to hide from predators, its pee is less of an issue so it will do that elsewhere. Also, cats prefer to use a litter tray that is high up and hidden so they feel less vulnerable. Look at your litter tray setup and change it accordingly.”What they do: spray urine on vertical areasWhat it means: ‘I’m worried about something in this place’“If not neutered, your cat, male or female, will spray as a sexual marking,” says Bru, “If neutered, this is a stress sign – look at what may have changed in the environment, such as the threat of other (unfamiliar) cats who may be able to enter or stare into the house.”What they do: yawnWhat is means: ‘I’m chilled’Usually a yawn is a relaxed signal of your cat releasing stress and relaxing. This is another chance for you to communicate with them. Yawn back and see what happens.What they do: gently bite you during petting What it means: ‘This is gooood’A gentle nibble means serious appreciation a harder one may suggest your cat is a little over-stimulated, so perhaps give them some space.What they do: bring you dead animalsWhat it means: ‘You’re a terrible hunter’Bringing home a kill is often more common in females than males, some research suggests by bringing home the kill, the cat has adopted you as part of its family and its DNA says it has to feed you and teach you how to hunt. However, it’s also just what they do, cats are hardwired to hunt – some more so than others. Bringing home a kill actually has nothing to do with you, says Bru. “Cats will stalk and kill prey, even when they don’t have the intention of eating it. They will bring it to their core area, because this is where they feel safe.”You don’t need to be a mind reader or body language expert to know what your cat needs to eat – at every stage of life, they require food tailored to them.

She reflects on the hard-won highs that come with sharing a home – and a heart – with a felineIf cats are capricious, the humans who love them are worse. To be a cat lover is to embrace confusion, rejection, austerity, frustration and chaos. To share your home with a cat is to seek comfort, beauty, affection and joy, but accept that such delights will be tightly rationed, allocated seemingly at random, and frequently withheld altogether. Cat lovers are philosophers, poets and perverts, and I wouldn’t be anything else.Contrary as they are, cat lovers mistrust the undiscerning affection and allegiance of dogs. Naturally it’s possible to appreciate all animals, and I genuinely love dogs, but when a labrador bounds up to me like I’m some sort of human holy grail, I’m reminded of the words of Groucho Marx: “I don’t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member.”My cat, Elvis, by contrast, makes me feel like I have something to prove. Elvis keeps me on my toes he holds me accountable for my actions. My cat makes me want to be a better human. And, like all pack animals, I respond well to being kept in check by my tiny furry overlord.It’s been six months since Elvis came into my life, as an eight-month-old black longhair rescue. Speaking to the shelter, I explained that I didn’t care about colour, age or gender, but specifically requested a “dog-cat”. Dog-cats share some of the genial qualities more regularly attributed to a dog, by being social, confident and affectionate. Throughout my childhood, my mother excelled at selecting dog-cats: non-skittish, friendly little moggies who could handle the aggressive adulation and clumsy affection of three small children. Gingie, Coke and Parsley were all dog-cats. Now I’m an adult, I made certain that the first cat I chose was a dog-cat.Elvis waits by the window when I return home from work in the evening. He thoughtfully inspects every new visitor to my flat, as if they are a second-hand Volvo he’s considering purchasing. He’s every inch the alpha, striding confidently into the room, announcing his presence with a succession of meows.Green-eyed, long-haired and graceful, at times Elvis resembles a moving sculpture, and he is quite the prettiest object in my home. He’s also a breathing, purring hot water bottle, and his weight, warmth and rhythmic breathing make my shoulders slacken and my pulse slow at the end of a frantic day. He frequently makes me laugh out loud, play-fighting with my left foot, lolling voluptuously on the sofa, or playing football with purloined biros across the wooden floorboards. Sometimes he glares at me with barely disguised contempt and disapproval, when I come home late, smelling of another animal. It’s nice to know that he cares enough to be cross.But Elvis allows me my independence. I’m permitted my frequent work trips, providing that I supply a temporary giant slave woman during my absence. When I come back, I stretch out on the sofa and he falls asleep on my chest, and then I know that the cat-sitter has not replaced me in his affections. One of the joys of owning a cat is building these little rituals together. Rituals that nobody else understands but Elvis and I.Adopting a rescue cat like Elvis makes the owner-cat journey even more of an emotional melodrama. I watched him grow from being a slightly cagey kitten to a confident, strutting alpha cat. Today he acts like he doesn’t need me, but I take comfort in the knowledge that it was my love, attention and steady supply of edibles that turned him into the independent young man that he is. I don’t know anything about his background we prefer not to dwell on the past, Elvis and I, and just look to our happy future together.If you’re embarking on your own cat-owner journey, get off to happy, healthy and – here’s hoping – affectionate start with our advice on everything from prepping your home to the early days of kitten development and training, and make sure you start by feeding them correctly.

Thus Anthony McGrath has stepped up from number two, with the popular Dimi Mascarenhas joining the staff. On the field they bring in Peter Siddle for early overseas duties, before Neil Wagner returns to send them down from mid-May. Matt Coles, from Kent, is their other significant addition. A blend of experience and youth suggests another challenge, especially if Simon Harmer and Jamie Porter pick up where they left off.T20 Blast eight in South GroupStarting like a train last summer before grinding to a halt, Hampshire have since bolstered their batting by drafting in Hashim Amla as their early overseas player and winning the race to sign Sam Northeast from Kent. The latter appears primed for the step up to Division One and is freed from captaincy duties, so if runs flow then England chatter may well follow. Dale Steyn is due for a two-match stint in June and a possible return later in the season but much depends on his fitness. Reece Topley will be white-ball only and Mason Crane is out for two months.Royal London Cup sixth in South GroupDurham were raided over the winter, with Keaton Jennings and Graham Onions bolstering a side that surpassed expectations last summer and appear to be shaping up for a title challenge. Onions replaces Kyle Jarvis, who has given up Kolpak status to return to Zimbabwe, but Shiv Chanderpaul returns in this capacity, aged 43, after averaging 51 last season. Liam Livingstone steps up as captain although he will be pushing for a Test place, while the experienced Australian seamer Joe Mennie arrives as overseas player. Haseeb Hameed, Alex Davies and Saqib Mahmood are due strong seasons.T20 Blast: seventh in North GroupNotts’ return to the top-flight comes after a golden summer that saw both white-ball trophies lifted. The previous two times promotion has been achieved the title has followed but consolidation would be fine given the retirements of Chris Read and Michael Lumb, and Alex Hales going limited-overs only. In come the veteran Chris Nash from Sussex and Ross Taylor as the early overseas player. Tom Moores gets his chance with the gloves while Steven Mullaney steps up as captain. A long-term injury to Paul Coughlin, after the all-rounder signed from Durham, is a blow but Jake Ball returns from the Ashes with a point to prove.Last summer’s great escape followed a title challenge the previous year, so which way Somerset go this time around is tricky to gauge, especially as they are under new management. The pitch at Taunton – aka Ciderabad – will likely continue to be a strong asset although how much they see of Jack Leach will now hinge on England’s requirements. Jamie Overton’s return from injury and his twin Craig’s confidence from international honours are plusses, although Cameron Bancroft has seen his overseas deal scrapped for his role in the Australian ball-tampering scandal. Tom Abell just about survived his first year as captain and should be better for it.Rory Burns replaces Gareth Batty as captain and could push for England honours if the opener adds more centuries to his already consistent returns. Kumar Sangakkara’s departure leaves a 1,491-run hole to fill – Virat Kohli may possibly fill this for three matches – while their overseas deal for Mitchell Marsh has been scuppered by ankle surgery. Tom Curran has gone to the IPL but a reinforcement comes in the shape of Morne Morkel, signed on a two-year Kolpak deal. Vikram Solanki, Ryan Sidebottom and Chris Taylor have all joined the coaching staff.The Pears are newly promoted but under new management, with the Steve Rhodes era now ended. In come Kevin Sharp and the former New Road favourite Alan Richardson to run the show. Steve Magoffin has arrived from Sussex to take the new ball (citing the latter as inspiration), while a fellow Australian, Travis Head, is their overseas player. Otherwise it is over to homegrown talent again, with Daryl Mitchell looking to replicate last year’s four-figure summer and Joe Clarke getting a chance to nudge the England selectors in Division One. Two away games to begin with are handy given the latest flooding to hit New Road.County Championship: first Division TwoGeoffrey Boycott has already pooh-poohed the appointment of a sports psychologist to address falling returns from the batsmen in first-class cricket last year. But the diagnosis is at least accurate, with Gary Ballance’s average of 67 some 30 runs higher than the next best. Two old favourites return to share overseas duties, with Cheteshwar Pujara – Steve to his team-mates – signed up until June and Kane Williamson thereafter. To the annoyance of those in charge, David Willey and Liam Plunkett have been lost to the IPL at the 11th hour, while Adil Rashid has signed a white-ball only deal.Last season’s extra focus on Twenty20 cricket, hiring John Wright as specialist coach, returned a second-place group stage finish only for Derbyshire be marmalised by Hampshire in the quarter-finals. Ravi Rampaul, on a Kolpak deal from Surrey, represents one of two additions to last season, with South African seamer Duane Olivier filling the overseas slot for the first half of the season. All-rounder Shiv Thakor has left following his conviction for two charges of indecent exposure. Runs from the top order and an injury-free season for Hardus Viljoen are needed.Freed from the shackles of their draconian points deductions but having lost another three key first-team players, Durham will once again look to their production line of local talent under the stewardship of the evergreen Paul Collingwood. Aiden Markram, the palindromic South African opener, looks a shrewd signing until mid-May after a bumper start to his Test career, after which New Zealander Tom Latham arrives and will lead the 50-over side. The Indian spin-bowling all-rounder Axar Patel finishes off the season.The arrival of Shaun Marsh as overseas player for the season, fresh from reasserting himself as a Test cricketer, looks a coup for Glamorgan, who saw some incremental improvement across last summer. Their semi-final Blast finish was the highlight and now under the stewardship of Colin Ingram, the Kolpak white-ball cricketer, they should be strong in the limited-overs formats. Championship-wise, it is a question of whether the likes of Aneurin Donald and Andrew Salter turn talent into consistent returns.The opener Chris Dent has taken over the captaincy of a side that regressed slightly last summer. Runs were the main issue but the club has switched to signing a bowler as their overseas player, with the livewire South Australia seamer Daniel Worral joining until mid-July. The batsmen will, however, get some extra support from Chris Rogers in a two-month coaching role. The all-rounder Ryan Higgins has joined from Middlesex and the bowling will be lead by last year’s player of the season, the seamer Liam Norwell. Andrew Tye and Michael Klinger are strong overseas players for the Blast, where their best chance of success appears.The departures of Sam Northeast to Hampshire and Matt Coles to Essex were significant blows over the winter. The likeable Sam Billings takes over the captaincy from the former (once he returns from the IPL) while the South African Heino Kuhn arrives on a Kolpak deal to shore up the batting. Seamer Harry Podmore has also come in from Middlesex, with Matt Henry, a Kiwi quick, their overseas player for the first half of the season. The former ECB managing director Paul Downton is now running the club too.The Foxes have undergone their latest reboot, with club favourite Paul Nixon expected to inject fresh energy as head coach – and some T20 nous from his two Caribbean Premier League titles – and Michael Carberry arriving from Hampshire to lead the side in all formats. The Indian seamer Varun Aaron and the highly-rated Zak Chappell could combine for the quickest pairing in the ision but will need support, as will the batting mainstay Mark Cosgrove, who returns to the ranks after a disappointing spell in charge results-wise.All the talk last summer was of hitting the reset button after lifting the title in 2016 but instead Middlesex flopped on all fronts. Dawid Malan’s rise to the captaincy is likely to be stop-start given his England commitments, while Eoin Morgan was due to be available for 12 championship matches but misses at least three with a broken thumb. Nick Compton, previously told he would not feature as the club look to the future, may yet receive a lifeline. The Australian all-rounder Hilton Cartwright arrives as early season cover.White-ball specialism made way for a stronger first-class campaign last summer and the club has made some interesting signings over the winter. The seamer Brett Hutton gets his chance after sitting in reserve for long spells at Notts, while the South African wicketkeeper Ricardo Vasconcelos (holder of an EU passport) is highly rated in his home country. Rory Kleinveldt returns as overseas player from mid-May, with the New Zealand seamer Doug Bracewell covering until then. Ben Duckett misses the early championship rounds after finger surgery.Few can argue that Sussex have pulled off a coup in luring Jason Gillespie back to county cricket. The architect of Yorkshire’s two most recent titles arrives after winning the Big Bash League with Adelaide Strikers. Big things are expected from Ben Brown, the new captain, and Michael Burgess, while Luke Wells will look to build on last year’s 1,292-run season. Rashid Khan could be the signing of the summer when the Afghan leg-spinner arrives for the Blast and India’s Ishant Sharma is in place for the first two months.The silver-lining of reaching the Blast final thanks to a switch of captaincy from Ian Bell to Grant Elliott and an injection of youth, could not detract from the black cloud of relegation. An ageing squad of high wages but diminishing returns was to blame – the bowling and fitness coaches inexplicably carried the can – but the rebuild at least began early, with the mid-season signings of Dom Sibley, Adam Hose and Will Rhodes. Jeetan Patel takes over as captain and the hope is that Bell can find form in Division Two. Promotion is demanded."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df55a863eb9a7ef4c3d1353fa1288a0128fe48a8/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1bdd4520ae3ac75aff23e1a3341ace6c 1240w","title":"jack laugher wins gold in 1m springboard to defend commonwealth diving title","story":"Jack Laugher completed the first part of a possible hat-trick with men’s 1m springboard gold as the ing events got underway.The 23-year-old Harrogate er dominated to successfully defend the title he won at Glasgow 2014.

The 130-year-old award can only be won once in a career, of course, although it is perhaps Tammy Beaumont, leading scorer and player of the women’s World Cup, whose case was strongest among those to miss out.Describing Knight’s achievement as “the culmination of a personal tour de force that helped change women’s cricket for ever”, Wisden’s editor, Lawrence Booth, noted the 27-year-old’s captaincy throughout a campaign in which she scored 364 runs at an average of 45, including a century against Pakistan.It is Shrubsole who is on the cover of the 155th edition, however, after the seamer lit up a Lord’s final that had been slipping away from the home side with a spell of five for 11, in figures of six for 46, that derailed India’s chase of 229 and, according to Booth, secured “national hero status”.Sciver, meanwhile, is credited for producing the most memorable shot of 2017 – the deliberate clip between her legs that was dubbed “The Natmeg” in some quarters – but is described as “more than a one-trick pony”, given her 346 runs in the tournament and figures of three for three with the ball against West Indies.New to Wisden this year is the introduction of an award for the leading Twenty20 cricketer in the world. It is another sign of the times, too, both in terms of the format’s recognition, some 15 years on from its inception, and the nationality of the winner: Afghanistan’s leg-spinning sensation, Rashid Khan.The 19-year-old has emerged as one of the most in-demand Twenty20 cricketers on the circuit – Wisden describes his googly as “one of the most dangerous deliveries in the world game” – with 80 wickets in 2017 at just 14 apiece. An economy-rate of 5.53 was equally impressive.This short-format award complements the existing men and women’s leading cricketer in the world categories, which this year are India’s two captains: Virat Kohli and Mithali Raj. Their sides lost their respective global finals – the Champions Trophy and the Women’s World Cup – but they enjoyed stellar returns personally.For Kohli it is the second year in succession he has topped the lot, with his 2,818 runs across all formats more than 700 ahead of Joe Root in second place. Raj, meanwhile, surpassed Edwards as the all-time leading run scorer in women’s ODIs and scored a record seven successive half-centuries.Elsewhere in Wisden, which is published on Thursday, Booth uses his notes to warn the England and Wales Cricket Board not to take the Ashes for granted after the winter’s 4-0 defeat in Australia amid a record run of 13 away Tests without a victory for the national team.The ECB’s chief executive, Tom Harrison, also sets out his vision for the new Twenty20 tournament from 2020 onwards – with the counter argument presented by ESPNCricinfo’s George Dobell – while Tanya Aldred has written on both sexism in cricket and the sport’s relationship with the environment.Among the index of unusual occurrences in this year’s edition is the tantalising “Groundstaff forced home in underpants”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fd2599147072377ea054d6866cfb46652613476/0_0_3488_2187/master/3488.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5794a2f12675bb15c7e147775c62c78","title":"huawei matebook x pro laptop review slim macbook pro rival","story":"Beautiful screen, excellent keyboard, great trackpad – Huawei’s new machine shows it has what it takes to build a great laptopThe MateBook X Pro is Huawei’s more powerful follow up to last year’s excellent MateBook X, and as the name might imply it is aimed squarely at Apple’s MacBook Pro.PC laptops have come a long way in the last few years, with good design, build and performance – all hallmarks of Apple’s laptop line – now common in the £1,000-plus category.It would be fair to say that the MateBook X Pro has more than a passing resemblance to Apple’s top-end laptop. It’s not that it’s a carbon copy, more a machine that takes just the good bits.With the lid closed it looks like a fairly generic thin-and-light aluminium laptop with a gentle taper and a Huawei logo on the top, available in “space grey” and silver. Open it and you find a MacBook-like backlit keyboard, large trackpad, a power button and two side grilles.But the screen is the star of the show. It’s a beautiful and crisp 13.9in 3:2-ratio screen squeezed into the frame with very slim bezels all round. It’s easily one of the best on the market and is quite large by modern laptop standards, housed in a smaller body typically associated with a 12in-screen laptop.The build of the machine is generally very good, with chamfered edges and a good fit and finish. There’s no give or flex in the keyboard, but there is a little in the rest of the deck and at the sides. The screen also has a little bit of give when squeezed when closed, or twisted when open.The MateBook X Pro is available in a couple of configurations, with a choice of 8th generation Core i5 and i7 processors, 8 or 16GB of RAM and 256 or 512GB of storage.Most of that is par for the course, but the Huawei machine also comes with a discrete Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics card with 2GB of dedicated memory, which is rare for a machine of this size.The MX150 won’t set the gaming world alight, but it is a significant step up in performance for things like editing photos and video, or even powering a 4K display over your typical integrated graphics chips. It’s worth noting that the MX150 comes in two versions and the MateBook X Pro is fitted with the lower power 10W version, which is less powerful but more frugal than the 25W version that some other machines have fitted.Overall the MateBook X Pro was one of the best performing laptops I’ve ever used, easily handling anything and everything from video editing and advanced photo editing, to a bit of light gaming and Chrome with as many tabs as you can fit on one screen.The MateBook X Pro might be thin, but it still has a single full-sized USB 3.0 port along side a USB-C port and a Thunderbolt 3 port. Either of the USB-C-shaped ports can be used to charge the machine, while there’s a traditional headphones socket, but no card reader.Huawei is well known for its battery life in smartphones. Unfortunately, while the MateBook X Pro has reasonable battery life it isn’t anywhere near class-leading. It will get you through a work day without needing the charger, but if you want to watch a video on the commute home you’ll be out of luck.In my testing the MateBook X Pro lasted just over eight hours between charges while performing regular office duties, which includes lots of email, around 15 browser tabs open in Chrome, some photo editing, listening to music via Bluetooth headphones and lots of writing into lightweight text editors. Heavier things such as gaming affected the battery life quite a bit, but generally speaking most users will plug the laptop in to game or perform similarly demanding tasks for any extended period.Performance aside, the MateBook X Pro is a lovely machine to use. It’s whisper-quiet for the most part, with its fans only spinning under sustained heavy load, and its brilliant screen is matched by an equally excellent keyboard and trackpad. The keyboard looks like a MacBook Pro keyboard, but with real key travel. It’s a satisfying typing experience that is rarer than you might think on even expensive laptops.The keyboard also hides one of the most interesting tricks I’ve seen on a laptop in a while. The key between F6 and F7 is actually a pop-up webcam. Press it and it reveals a one-megapixel camera, which certainly has a tendency for the up-the-nose shot, but simply doesn’t get in the way during normal use. If you’re one of the vast majority of laptop users that barely ever turn on their webcam, this is a great compromise and it means no one is going to be able to hack your webcam and spy on you. There’s even a mute switch for the microphones, so no one will be able to listen to you either.The large trackpad is silky smooth and responsive, making it one of the best in the industry – at no stage did I end up zooming when I tried to scroll, which is something many PC laptops still struggle with.The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner and will recognise you and log you into Windows when switching on with one momentary press, taking about eight seconds to power on and be useable. The MateBook X Pro has a Dolby Atmos sound system with four speakers built into it: two tweeters at the back and two bass speakers at the front, not that there’s any visual indication that they’re there.I was sceptical, but the four-speaker system actually works very well. It’s louder, clearer and has a smidgeon more bass than most of the best of the rest, although the audio is less direct than it might be on a machine with front-facing speakers such as Microsoft’s Surface Pro.They’re still laptop speakers, so don’t expect true room-filling sound or the quality of a set of external speakers, but they’re capable of being clearly heard while cooking and provide solid impromptu movie-watching experience.The Huawei MateBook X Pro will cost €1,499 with a Core i5, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, €1,699 for the same processor and RAM but 512GB of storage, or €1,899 with a Core i7, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage – as tested.A UK launch and pricing has yet to be determined.For comparison, For comparison, Dell’s XPS 13 with a comparable screen and 8th generation Core i5 starts at £1,399, Microsoft’s Surface Laptop starts at £979, the Surface Book 2 starts at £1,499 and Apple’s MacBook Pro starts at £1,249.Models with discrete graphics cost more, with Microsoft’s Surface Book 2 starting at £1,999 and Apple’s 15in MacBook Pro starting at £2,349.The MateBook X Pro shows that Huawei has what it takes to build a great laptop.The screen is brilliant and the tiny bezels mean you get a very good sized display in a pretty small body – 14in, it turns out, is a great size for both work and play on a thin and light laptop. It’s not a one-trick pony, either.

Instead of having to remember an increasingly long string of characters, users can authenticate their login with their body or something they have in their possession, communicating directly with the website via Bluetooth, USB or NFC.“WebAuthn will change the way that people access the Web,” said Jeff Jaffe, chief executive of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the body that controls web standards.One example of how WebAuthn will work is that when a user visits a site they want to log into, they input a user name and then get an alert on their smartphone. Tapping on the alert on their phone then logs them into the website without the need for a password.WebAuthn promises to protect users against phishing attacks and the use of stolen credentials as there will be nothing to steal, the authentication token is generated and used once by their specific device each time the user logs in.“After years of increasingly severe data breaches and password credential theft, now is the time for service providers to end their dependency on vulnerable passwords and one-time-passcodes and adopt phishing-resistant FIDO Authentication for all websites and applications,” said Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO Alliance, one of the bodies pushing the new standard.WebAuthn should also help people use unique login details for each and every service they use, instead of using the same login and password for every site, which many people still do leaving them vulnerable to further attacks if one site is hacked.The W3C has moved WebAuthn to what’s called the “candidate recommendation” stage – the penultimate step before it becomes an approved web standard – inviting sites and services to begin implementing it. The web standards body announced that Google, Microsoft and Mozilla had committed to supporting WebAuthn, meaning that all major web browsers short of Apple’s Safari will implement the new standard.“While there are many web security problems and we can’t fix them all, relying on passwords is one of the weakest links. With WebAuthn’s multi-factor solutions we are eliminating this weak link,” said Jaffe.Several sites and services already use similar methods to log in, including Google and Facebook, which can both be logged into using a USB security key. But a single cross-platform, cross-service standard ratified by the W3C will mean that many more sites and services will be able to kill the password as the defacto login method.WebAuthn is the culmination of many years of work and the change will not happen overnight. But as it increasingly seems inevitable that our email or other online services will get hacked into, removing the password is an important step in improving online security and making using sites and services easier."},{"url":null,"title":"mark zuckerberg testimony live updates house congress cambridge analytica","story":"Facebook CEO appears at Senate hearing to answer questions over data misuse in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelationsFred Upton, a Republican from Michigan, is asking whether it’s possible to craft regulation that won’t stifle startups. Zuck: I think it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation, but you have to be careful about what it is. Bobby Rush: Why is the onus on the user to opt in to privacy? Zuckerberg is not going to move off his line that users can limit the audience of their posts. Rush moves on to Facebook’s reported violations of civil rights law forbidding discriminatory advertising. Bobby Rush: You are truncating the basic rights of the American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness by the wholesale invasion and manipulation of their right to privacy. What is the difference between Facebook’s methodology and the methodology of American political pariah J Edgar Hoover? Zuck: On Facebook, you have control over your information. The content you share, you put there. Says that no other surveillance operation gives you the ability to opt out.Barton: Is there any reason why we should have rules of no data sharing for Facebook users under 18?Zuck: We have a number of measures in place to protect minors... The reality that we see is that teens often do want to share their opinions publicly. Zuck is again talking about the ability to limit the audience of shared content, not about the targeted advertising to children based on data Facebook gathers about them. Joe Barton is asking why Diamond and Silk were censored on Facebook. Zuck says it was a mistake.Here’s a Washington Post article about the conservative sisters. Pallone asks if Facebook limits the type of data it collects and uses.Zuck says they do, but Pallone says he doesn’t see how. Zuck says yes, that they’ve changed the way that developers can get access to data, which is not the question. Pallone: Will you change all user default settings to minimize to the greatest extent possible all the user data? Yes or no. Zuck says that he won’t give a one word answer. Scratch that: Zuckerberg is explaining that Facebook doesn’t sell data despite Walden’s statement that he understands that fact.Walden is foreclosing Zuck’s canned response that Facebook doesn’t technically sell data, arguing that it does monetize it, and stating that data might be the only thing of true value that Facebook does have.Walden: You can send money on Facebook. Are you a financial company?Walden notes that Facebook is increasingly broadcasting original television content: Is Facebook a media company?Zuckerberg: I consider us to be a technology company. Zuckerberg is still saying that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica misused or improperly obtained data, despite Senator Blumenthal’s release of the terms of service yesterday, which appeared to show that he did have permission to share, sell, and transfer the data.Zuckerberg is now making his opening statement. If this sounds familiar, it’s because he’s reading the same words he read yesterday, in his opening statement at the Senate hearing. Pallone: “We need comprehensive privacy and data protection legislation.” Frank Pallone, the ranking Democrat, is now making his opening statement, noting that Facebook is ubiquitous, and most of us are locked in.“For all the good it brings, Facebook can be a weapon for groups like Russia and Cambridge Analytica,” he says.Walden is already showing a stronger grasp of the distinction between data users consciously share and data Facebook collects than many of the senators had yesterday.Zuckerberg is seated and we’re getting started. Commitee chairman Greg Walden is kicking us off with an opening statement. “While Facebook has surely grown, I worry it has not matured.”While we are waiting for today’s hearing to get underway, let’s look back at a fun little parable of privacy from yesterday: the tale of Mark Zuckerberg’s notes. During one of the short breaks during yesterday’s hearing, Zuck left a copy of his typed notes open on the table. When he left the room, reporters pounced. An AP photo of the talking points went viral, as reporters and Facebook critics pored over the text for the merest shred of red meat.Some of the tidbits were legitimately interesting others merely titillating. We now know how Zuck was prepared to respond to attacks (“Respectfully, I reject that”), that he was prepared to respond to calls for his resignation, and that he needed a bold-faced reminder that Facebook is not already compliant with forthcoming European data privacy standards. But what should we call what happened with the notes? Was this a breach of Zuckerberg’s privacy? Or did he, by leaving the information unprotected in a public space, “share” that information with us? And is there any meaningful recourse after information that was intended for a limited audience is taken out of context and shared with an entirely different audience? Welcome to our second day of live coverage of Mark Zuckerberg testifying before the US Congress.Yesterday, Zuckerberg was questioned by 44 senators from two committees in a five-hour joint session. This morning, he returns to Capitol Hill to face the House committee on energy and commerce, starting at 10am EDT. The Senate hearing may have been a marathon, but Zuckerberg was rarely forced to break a sweat. Senators trying to press him on Facebook’s unprecedented collection and use of personal data were tripped up by semantics and technical details, providing the 33-year-old executive with the opportunity to deflate and deflect many lines of questioning. Today, we’ll be watching to see if any representatives are able to break Zuckerberg’s talking points filibuster on the data that fuels Facebook’s advertising machine – or wring out new details about the company’s relationships with the Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan, his company GSR, and the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.For our full report on yesterday’s proceedings, check out Washington DC bureau chief David Smith’s write up here.

He was elected House speaker in 2015 after former House speaker John Boehner retired. He was former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s running mate in 2012.Friends said Ryan was ready to step down after passing a tax reform bill, one of his longtime goals, Axios reported.On Twitter, Donald Trump, who has long had a contentious relationship with Ryan, praised him. Trump wrote: “Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!”Ryan initially declined to endorse Trump after he clinched the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential election and said Trump’s attacks on a Hiic judge were the “textbook definition of a racist comment”. But he later embraced Trump’s candidacy and has been an ally of the administration on Capitol Hill.Ryan’s departure increases the number of House Republicans not seeking re-election in 2018 to 43. This record exodus has left many Democrats optimistic about their chances of picking up the 24 seats they would need to retake the majority.In a statement, Tyler Law, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said: “Speaker Ryan sees what is coming in November, and is calling it quits rather than standing behind a House Republican agenda to increase healthcare costs for middle-class families while slashing social security and Medicare to pay for his handouts to the richest and largest corporations.”There is a competitive Democratic primary there between ironworker Randy Bryce and schoolteacher Cathy Myers. The only other Republican candidate running, Paul Nehlen, is a vocal antisemite and white nationalist.

Giving evidence via video link from Paris to the inquest at the Old Bailey in London, his girlfriend, Elmira Medynska, said Perepilichnyy appeared distracted when she met him in Paris two days before his death, and different from when she had seen him previously.Traces of a rare and deadly plant poison, gelsemium elegans, were discovered in Perepilichnyy’s stomach after his death, the inquest has heard. However, Surrey police and Perepilichnyy’s widow have disputed that he was murdered and said the scientific evidence was inconclusive.Perepilichnyy was threatened after revealing details of a $230m (£165m) fraud, stolen from taxes paid by the investment company Hermitage Capital to the Russian treasury, carried out by a gang with alleged links to the Kremlin.A lawyer who investigated the case, Sergei Magnitsky, was arrested and died in prison in 2009.Medynska, a Ukrainian fashion entrepreneur, first met Perepilichnyy in Kiev in May 2012 after he had begun messaging her in March, having seen her profile on an online dating site.She told the court that when she met Perepilichnyy in Paris, where they stayed at the Hotel Bristol on 8 November, he drank a lot for lunchtime and more than usual, spilling wine on himself. She said his hands had been shaky.When he took her shoe shopping the next day, he was “on another planet”, ignoring her and looking at messages on his phone, she said.That night, they went to dinner at the Buddha Bar. Medynska said Perepilichnyy positioned the couple so he could see everyone around them but she could not. She thought this unusual as it meant him sitting on the sofa and her on the chair, whereas it was customarily the other way round.“He was looking for people around ... He was a little bit stressful that evening,” said Medynska.She told the court that Perepilichnyy sent back some food she thought might have been vegetable or prawn tempura because he did not like the taste, which angered him. She said he did not try her food but she could not recall whether she had tried his. Medynska said when they went back to the hotel, Perepilichnyy was in the bathroom for about an hour, during which time she heard him vomit three times. When he came out of the bathroom he had red eyes and a red face but did not talk about vomiting or the food he had eaten earlier, she said.However, Perepilichnyy was fine the next morning and ate breakfast normally before leaving Paris, she told the court.Medynska said she received four calls on 12 and 13 November from an English number from people with English accents claiming to be Perepilichnyy’s friends. They told her he had been in a car accident and that they were at hospital with him. They asked her lots of questions but did not tell her that he had died, Medynska said.She told the court that she did not find out he was dead until 31 December when she searched the internet for his name. Medynska said she was very scared when she found out, and later received an email from Perepilichnyy’s account saying: “You will die soon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30acd21b524ed5f309b8e318968cc61e6f821c96/0_136_2293_1376/master/2293.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c95fe6280369126ca52f3b1ef12c273a 1240w","title":"myanmar judge rules reuters reporters must stand trial over report of rohingya massacre","story":"Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo to be tried over report on atrocity the army admits took placeTwo Reuters journalists arrested while investigating a massacre of Rohingya Muslims will face trial in Myanmar after a court rejected a motion to drop the case against them.Reporters Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were detained in December and accused of violating the country’s Official Secrets Act for possessing material relating to security operations in Rakhine state that was handed to them by the police.Myanmar has faced global condemnation and accusations of extrajudicial killings, ethnic cleansing and genocide as about 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Rakhine for Bangladesh after a military crackdown on insurgents. The government rejects the allegations and says it was defending itself against attacks from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army that took place in August.The Rohingya are Muslims who live in majority-Buddhist Myanmar. They are often described as the world\u0027s most persecuted minority.\u0026nbspNearly all of Myanmar\u0027s 1.1 million Rohingya live in the western coastal state of Rakhine. The government does not recognise them as citizens, effectively rendering them stateless.Extremist nationalist movements insist the group are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, although the Rohingya say they are native to Rakhine state.Rights groups accuse Burmese authorities of ethnic cleansing, systematically forcing Rohingya from the country through violence and persecution, a charge the government has denied.The two reporters have been held in Insein prison in Yangon since their arrest while facing hearings to determine whether the case will go to trial, with 17 out of 25 witnesses having given testimony.Their lawyers asked the court to dismiss the case last week, citing in part troubling discrepancies in witness statements, but the motion was swiftly rejected in a Yangon courtroom packed with supporters, family and media.“The court decided that the proposal from the defendants’ lawyer to release the defendants before all the witnesses were cross-examined has been rejected,” the judge, Ye Lwin, said.The pair had been investigating a massacre of 10 Rohingya men on 2 September in the Rakhine village of Inn Din that was carried out by security forces and local residents.The military admitted the atrocity took place and Reuters later published the story while the reporters were in prison.In a rare punishment in a country where the military has long operated with impunity, seven soldiers were sentenced to jail with hard labour for their part in the killings on Tuesday.The army has claimed the Rohingya men were terrorists, but has not presented any evidence to back up the claim. Wa Lone referred to the sentencing of the soldiers as he was being directed back into the police van after the hearing.“Those who killed people in the mass killing were given a sentence of 10 years. We were simply trying to find out the news and report this and we are facing a trial that could result in us going to prison for 14 years,” he said.One of his lawyers, Than Zaw Aung, also compared the cases: “My question is why are the journalists still in detention in prison if their report is true.”The case against the journalists has proceeded despite international calls for their release. Reuters announced last month that the prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney had joined the legal team.The president of Reuters, Stephen J Adler, said the company was deeply disappointed with the court’s decision.“We believe there are solid grounds for the court to dismiss this matter and to release our journalists. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were reporting on issues in Myanmar in an independent and impartial way,” he said. “They have not violated any laws in the course of their newsgathering and were simply doing their jobs.”Family members of the reporters were in tears after the ruling, but Wa Lone, who turned 32 on Wednesday and was brought cake by his friends, expressed optimism.“I believe in democracy. I also believe that one day we will be released because of freedom of expression,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d6cff78ccd5203e44fe07356d28bc1bb6464bb6/0_144_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e229b364c3356259a92e3b451abdafd1 1240w","title":"syrian airstrikes could disrupt commercial flights","story":"Eurocontrol advises airlines flying east Mediterranean routes to exercise cautionThe prospect of airstrikes in Syria has prompted the agency that coordinates air traffic across Europe to advise that commercial airlines flying east Mediterranean routes exercise caution over the next 72 hours.As debate mounted over possible military action, Eurocontrol said use of missiles could result in intermittent disruption of radio navigation equipment. The warning came on the back of increased discussion between the US and its western allies of airstrikes to punish the Syrian regime’s suspected ordering of a deadly chemical weapons attack in a rebel-held area of the country on Saturday. At least 42 people are thought to have died in Douma, the town where the attack occurred. In a statement on its website, the pan-European agency said due consideration should be taken in airspace across the region including Cyprus, the nearest EU member state to Syria.Most commercial carriers have stopped using Syrian airspace after warnings from aviation regulators during the country’s eight-year civil war. Only Syrian Air and Lebanon’s Middle East Airlines were offering commercial flights above Syria as of 0115 GMT on Wednesday, according to the flight tracking website FlightRadar24. Following the Eurocontrol statement a spokeswoman for Air France said the carrier had decided to alter flight paths on Beirut and Tel Aviv flights. EasyJet also announced that it would re-route flights from Tel Aviv. But Greece’s largest carrier, Aegean Airlines, which flies six times a day to Cyprus from Athens and Thessaloniki, said no changes had been made. “We are, like all airlines, on alert over the next 72 hours but no changes have been made on any scheduled flight for the time being,” a company representative said.The entire island of Cyprus and its surrounding waters were included in the designated airspace singled out by Eurocontrol.

The method it has developed does not detract from the taste of the finished drink, its says, while using less heat and water.Bubbles are said to be crucial in determining the taste of a beer. Traditionally, gas bubbles in the early stages of brewing are generated via steam through the natural cooking process, requiring bountiful levels of water and heat. AB InBev says, however, it is able to simulate the effects of boiling the brew.The new method involves heating the brew to below boiling point and then blowing nitrogen or CO2 into the tank to create bubbles without changing the taste. The company claims that because the beer is brewed at a lower temperature in the early phase, it can also stay fresh for longer. The bubbles found in the finished product are still to be produced in the normal way, typically by the yeast’s digestion of sugars or by pressurisation in the kegging process.David De Schutter, the company’s research director for Europe, said: “Boiling and these gas bubbles are the sacred formula in the brewing process. Each brewer goes through a boiling process.The company, which hopes all its breweries will adopt the technique within 10 years, is offering to share the patented technology free of charge with smaller brewers. A fee would be charged to the company’s larger rivals in the market. AB InBev has vowed to invest the money in further research to reduce its ecological footprint."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb16424df71d0782e4c88c0a2c0ff3d65460dddb/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=36539f24a45ad6f9351ac39d614c18c1 1720w","title":"good news at last the world isnt as horrific as you think","story":"Training yourself how to put the news into perspective – practising ‘factfulness’ – will change your outlook for the betterThings are bad, and it feels like they are getting worse, right? War, violence, natural disasters, corruption. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer and we will soon run out of resources unless something drastic is done. That’s the picture most people in the west see in the media and carry around in their heads.I call it the overdramatic worldview. It’s stressful and misleading. In fact, the vast majority of the world’s population live somewhere in the middle of the income scale. Perhaps they are not what we think of as middle class, but they are not living in extreme poverty. Their girls go to school, their children get vaccinated. Perhaps not on every single measure, or every single year, but step by step, year by year, the world is improving. In the past two centuries, life expectancy has more than doubled. Although the world faces huge challenges, we have made tremendous progress.The overdramatic worldview draws people to the most negative answers. It is not caused simply by out-of-date knowledge. My experience, over decades of lecturing and testing, has finally brought me to see that the overdramatic worldview comes from the very way our brains work. The brain is a product of millions of years of evolution, and we are hard-wired with instincts that helped our ancestors to survive in small groups of hunters and gatherers. We crave sugar and fat, which used to be life-saving sources of energy when food was scarce. But today these cravings make obesity one of the biggest global health problems. In the same way, we are interested in gossip and dramatic stories, which used to be the only source of news and useful information. This craving for drama causes misconceptions and helps create an overdramatic worldview.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can follow up with our Further Reading guides and can also recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.comWe still need these dramatic instincts to give meaning to our world. If we sifted every input and analysed every decision rationally, a normal life would be impossible. Just as we should not cut out all sugar and fat, we should not ask a surgeon to remove the parts of our brain that deal with emotions. But we need to learn to control our drama intake.Our instinct to notice the bad more than the good is related to three things: the misremembering of the past selective reporting by journalists and activists and the feeling that as long as things are bad, it’s heartless to say they are getting better. For centuries, older people have romanticised their youths and insisted that things ain’t what they used to be. Well, that’s true. Most things used to be worse. This tendency to misremember is compounded by the never-ending negative news from across the world.Stories about gradual improvements rarely make the front page even when they occur on a dramatic scale and affect millions of people. And thanks to increasing press freedom and improving technology, we hear about more disasters than ever before. This improved reporting is itself a sign of human progress, but it creates the impression of the exact opposite. At the same time, activists and lobbyists manage to make every dip in an improving trend appear to be the end of the world, scaring us with alarmist exaggerations and prophecies. In the United States, the violent crime rate has been falling since 1990. But each time something horrific or shocking happened – pretty much every year – a crisis was reported. The majority of people believe that violent crime is getting worse.My guess is you feel that me saying that the world is getting better is like me telling you that everything is fine, and that feels ridiculous. I agree. Everything is not fine. We should still be very concerned. As long as there are plane crashes, preventable child deaths, endangered species, climate change sceptics, male chauvinists, crazy dictators, toxic waste, journalists in prison, and girls not getting an education, we cannot relax. But it is just as ridiculous to look away from the progress that has been made. The consequent loss of hope can be devastating. When people wrongly believe that nothing is improving, they may lose confidence in measures that actually work.How can we help our brains to realise that things are getting better? Think of the world as a very sick premature baby in an incubator. After a week, she is improving, but she has to stay in the incubator because her health is still critical. Does it make sense to say that the infant’s situation is improving? Yes. Does it make sense to say it is bad? Yes, absolutely. Does saying “things are improving” imply that everything is fine, and we should all not worry? Not at all: it’s both bad and better. That is how we must think about the current state of the world.Remember that the media and activists rely on drama to grab your attention that negative stories are more dramatic than positive ones and how simple it is to construct a story of crisis from a temporary dip pulled out of its context of a long-term improvement. When you hear about something terrible, calm yourself by asking: if there had been a positive improvement, would I have heard about that? Even if there had been hundreds of larger improvements, would I have heard?This is “factfulness”: understanding as a source of mental peace.

The Mayor is currently in the West Bank city of Ramallah after border control officials at Ben-Gurion airport failed to prevent his entry last night due to the misspelling of his name on the warrant issued preventing him from entering the country. The Sinn Féin councillor travelled to Ramallah on the invitation of the Palestinian Authority, to attend a conference held on the status of the city of Jerusalem. A source in the population and immigration authority said the Dublin mayor entered Israel due to a technological glitch.“The details aren’t received with the man’s picture,” the source explained. “The ministry of strategic affairs misspelled the man’s name in the document it gave the border control, and that’s how it was entered into the system. If someone is barred from entering, the system should produce a warning as soon as the name is entered, but when someone arrives with a passport bearing a different name, there’s no way of knowing about the ban.”On Wednesday, Israeli ministries were blaming each other for the bureaucratic bungling that allowed the Mayor to pass through the airport undetected. The interior ministry claims it was provided with the wrong name, but the strategic affairs ministry insists Mr MacDonncha’s name was spelled correctly. “The probe is necessary in order to prevent such mishaps in the future and to glean lessons from what happened,” he said. “After the Lord Mayor of Dublin departs from the country, and in light of his activity against Israel, I’ve instructed that a letter be delivered to him which would forbid future entry into Israeli territory.” Mr Deri decided to bar the Mayor, who was invited to a conference in Ramallah as a guest of the Palestinian Authority, due to his active promotion of a boycott against Israel.In a statement to the media, Mr Deri said the Mayor led the Dublin City Council decision on April 9th calling on the Government to expel Israel’s ambassador to Ireland. Last August, Israel introduced a new policy to bar boycott activists from entering Israel. Officials in the strategic affairs ministry recommended Mr MacDonncha be denied entry into Israel due to his “consistent and clear activity to advance boycotts against Israel”, and his activity in one of the most radical boycott groups, the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Strategic affairs minister Gilad Erdan said “the policy I set is clear: He who works consistently to boycott Israel will not enter here”. Israel’s foreign ministry also issued a statement condemning the Dublin council decision calling for the Government to expel the Israeli ambassador.“The city of Dublin adopted a shameful and ridiculous resolution, in the hateful spirit of Hamas and similar organisations,” the statement said. “It is utterly unacceptable that the capital city of a country which is a member of the European Union adopts resolution that is entirely a boycott, hateful and racist. We expect a scathing Irish condemnation of this despicable resolution.”  Speaking on Wednesday morning on Newstalk Breakfast, Mr MacDonncha said he brought a message of support from Dublin for the need for inclusivity, a negotiated settlement and dialogue.Rejecting criticism that he should be focusing on the housing crisis in Dublin rather than travelling to Palestine, Mr MacDonncha said the visit was for only three days and that Ardmhéara had traditionally made occasional international visits.Mr MacDonncha said he had accepted the invitation because Dublin City Council supports the people of Palestine and was critical of Israel.Recent events in Gaza with the shooting of protesters by Israeli soldiers were reminiscent of Bloody Sunday in Derry, but on a larger scale, he said.The move by the Israeli government to declare Jerusalem the capital of the State of Israel was a backward step in the peace process, he added.Last year the United States also recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, in a move that sparked protests among Palestinians. “It’s very difficult to see hope of a peace deal,” Mr Mac Donncha said.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3458139.1523452645!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"czech-president-says-communists-and-far-right-could-join-government-1.3458147","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Thousands of demonstrators gather in Wenceslas Square to protest against Czech prime minister Andrej Babis, in Prague on Tuesday. Photograph: Martin DivisekEPAPro-Russian Czech president Milos Zeman has outraged opponents by urging prime minister Andrej Babis to try to form a government with ultra-nationalists who question the country’s EU membership and communists who want it to leave Nato. Mr Zeman made the suggestion to Mr Babis on Tuesday evening, when they discussed his Ano party’s failure to secure a parliamentary approval for its minority government almost six months after it won national elections.More moderate parties refuse to back a government led by Mr Babis while he faces prosecution for alleged fraud, relating to €2 million in EU funds that one of the billionaire’s many firms received a decade ago.The anti-immigration, Eurosceptic Mr Zeman has good relations with the communists and the Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party, which is virulently anti-Muslim and wants a referendum on a possible “Czexit”.“The presence of SPD extremists in government would harm the Czech Republic’s reputation in Europe. If Andrej Babis negotiates with them, it will confirm that he is not working for the people but only for the post of prime minister,” tweeted the Social Democrats’ chairman Jan Hamacek. Petr Fiala, leader of the centre-right Civic Democrats, said “an informal coalition” of Ano, the communists and the SPD had been operating since the election.“President Milos Zeman is its chief architect. So it is no surprise that he wants it to continue. It is up to Andrej Babis whether he wants to take responsibility for a government with extremists and communists.”Mr Zeman (73) was due to hold talks on Wednesday with communist leader Vojtech Filip and on Thursday with SPD chief Tomio Okamura, who has suggested that Czechs walk near mosques with dogs and pigs – unclean animals for Muslims – and boycott kebab stalls because their owners might be financing terrorism.Ano is expected to discuss Mr Zeman’s suggestion tomorrow, but some senior members have already refused to be part of any such coalition government.Coalition talks with the Social Democrats broke down last week when Ano refused to allow one of its members to become interior minister, which it demanded to ensure the impartiality of the fraud investigation facing Mr Babis.He denies wrongdoing, but suffered another blow in February when a court in his native Slovakia rejected his bid to be removed from a list of people who collaborated with the communist-era secret police.Thousands of people protested in Prague and other Czech cities on Monday to demand that Mr Babis drop his bid to become prime minister, to help end the political impasse and allow a new government to take power.Moderate parties have offered to form a coalition with Ano if it proposed a different premier Mr Babis (63) insists he would step aside for a party colleague, but Ano has refused to nominate an alternative.Mr Zeman – a frequent visitor to Russia who wants EU sanctions on the country lifted – has given Mr Babis until June to form a government, prolonging a period of political uncertainty in which his own power and profile are enhanced.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3458160.1523456542!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us-house-speaker-paul-ryan-announces-retirement-1.3458162","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan: Reports of his  departure have circulated for months.  Photograph: Shawn ThewEPAUS House Speaker Paul Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, told Republicans in the House of Representatives on Wednesday he will not seek re-election in November, his office said.Ryan will serve his full term and retire in January, said his spokesman Brendan Buck.“After nearly 20 years in the House, the speaker is proud of all that has been accomplished and is ready to devote more of his time to being a husband and a father,” said Mr Buck.The departure of 48-year-old Ryan could complicate Republican Party efforts to retain the House in November, when candidates may be dragged down by the unpopularity of President Donald Trump.The announcement of his departure months before the election will give potential candidates for House Republican leadership positions plenty of time to campaign for support.Reports of Mr Ryan’s departure have circulated for months. Politico reported in December that Ryan told confidants he would like to retire after the 2018 congressional elections.Friends said Ryan, a long-time champion of tax changes, was ready to step down after passing a taxation Bill, according to the Axios news site, which first reported on Wednesday that Ryan would soon announce his retirement.The tax Bill was Mr Trump’s first significant legislative victory since he took office in January 2017 despite being helped by Republican control of Congress.Politicians had expected Mr Ryan might leave Congress if Republicans lose the House in November. The early announcement could have an impact on Ryan’s ability to raise campaign funds for Republican candidates.More than three dozen House Republicans have said they are retiring, or running for another office, or resigning. Democrats need to win 23 seats in the elections to retake a majority in the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.Democrats believe that voter concerns over rising medical costs and Republican plans to cut Medicare and Medicaid will assist them in their fight to retake the House.“Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!” said Mr Trump.Mr Ryan was elected to the US House of Representatives in 1998 from Wisconsin at age 28 and was quickly pegged as a Republican rising star. He became 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential running mate, but Mr Romney was beaten by incumbent Democratic president Barack Obama.In Congress, Mr Ryan earned a reputation as a fiscal policy expert, serving as chairman of the House Budget Committee from 2011 until 2015. But as speaker was a driving force behind a Republican tax overhaul passed by Congress last year that is projected to balloon the federal deficit. – ReutersRead more about how and why Donald Trump\u0027s administration is sending shockwaves around the worldThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"day 1713 treaty utrecht signed ceding gibraltar britain","story":"A first edition of the Treaty of UtrechtWhen the insane King Charles II (“El Hechizado”, the bewitched) of Spain died childless in 1700, Europe was plunged into over a decade of conflict.Charles was the last Spanish Hapsburg, and a series of earlier treaties between England, France, and the Dutch Republic had preemptively ided up Spain’s possessions on his death and promised the throne to Prince Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria.
