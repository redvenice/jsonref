Other risk factors include an overweight father or pre-pregnant mother.A woman with high blood sugar can pass it through the placenta to their unborn child, which makes the baby’s body more likely to store fat, while overweight parents may pass on unhealthy eating habits. Other factors include a child’s birthweight, and weight compared to their length. Boys are about one fifth more likely to be overweight aged ten to 12 than girls.Older, more educated mothers, who may have higher incomes, are less likely to have overweight children. Other factors include ethnicity, parents smoking in the home and mothers smoking during pregnancy. Children exposed to smoke in the womb are born underweight, but then tend to grow more to compensate.

These showbiz highs, and lows, we owe to Sam Cowell.The highest-paid singing star of his day, he had songs known the world over, including the innocent-sounding Are You Good-Natured Dear? As his audiences knew full well, this was the stock greeting used by the prostitutes of the day sounding out any potential clients.         Music-hall veterans specialised in double-entendre, with suggestively titled songs like A Little of What You Fancy Does You Good!, and Pulling My Rhubarb Out. These showbiz highs, and lows, we owe to Sam Cowell. Pictured is music hall artist Marie LloydThese numbers went down a storm at the predecessors of the music halls, hugely popular evenings of musical entertainment organised by pub landlords and known as ‘free and easies’.Designed to keep their customers drinking, they were often rowdy occasions with audiences showing their disapproval of bad acts by hurling whatever came to hand at the stage. This included bottles, old boots and even, in one case, a dead cat.But Sam Cowell had few hecklers. Born in London in 1820, the son of actor Joseph Cowell, he had been appearing on stage since he was nine and his comic appeal was such that, as one reviewer wrote, it is ‘impossible to convey by words the inexpressible mirth which even his silence creates’.         Actress and male impersonator Vesta TilleyIn 1852 he was chosen to head the bill at the opulent pleasure palace that was London’s first purpose-built music hall, a 2,000-seat venue brimming with gaslights and glittering chandeliers.Grandly named The Canterbury Hall, it was designed to attract the aspirational working classes, who regarded themselves as too respectable for ‘free and easies’ and it seems fitting that it was on Westminster Bridge Road, not far from the hospital where Simon Cowell, the modern-day King of Variety, was born a century or so later.The attractions off the main hall included a waxwork exhibition and a menagerie, and there were occasional spectaculars such as the legendary Charles Blondin walking a tightrope strung across the auditorium at balcony level.But these one-offs apart, The Canterbury Hall put the emphasis firmly on nightly evenings of variety with acts including ‘Paul Vandy, the Peerless Juggler’ and ‘Mr Harry Edson and his Musical Pug’. But none ever outshone Sam Cowell who could earn today’s equivalent of £8,000 a week for his twice-nightly appearances at The Canterbury.When he once refused to go on stage one night, because another act had performed one of his songs, a near riot followed.By 1875, there were nearly 400 music halls in London alone. Most, like the Canterbury, seated the audience at long communal tables so that they could eat and drink during the shows.They could also promenade around the auditorium freely, leading to accusations that music-halls were being frequented by ladies ‘of known character’ — for which read prostitutes. Neither were moral campaigners of the day impressed by the ribald material of stars like Marie Lloyd.         By 1875, there were nearly 400 music halls in London alone. Most, like the Canterbury, seated the audience at long communal tables so that they could eat and drink during the shows. Pictured is famous juggler Paul Cinquevalli‘I haven’t had it up for ages,’ she would complain to the audience, unfolding her umbrella. As one impresario observed, she could have made the 23rd Psalm sound indecent.In the end, though, what did for the music halls was the realisation that audiences were prepared to pay more for plush inidual seats. From the 1890s onwards, a new breed of variety theatres spread across Britain. And in 1912, these venues reached even greater heights of respectability when the Palace Theatre in London hosted the first Royal Command Performance, in the presence of George V and Queen Mary.Performers included ‘The Little Flying Devil’ Paul Cinquevalli, who could balance a man on one arm above his head while juggling three balls with the other hand, and male impersonator Vesta Tilley, both inheritors of the variety tradition which Sam Cowell did so much to promote.Cowell did not live to see such acceptance.

Photograph: Win McNameeGetty ImagesUS attorney general William Barr defended his handling of the Mueller investigation during a fiery appearance at a US Senate committee on Wednesday.In his first appearance before Congress since he released a redacted version last month of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Mr Barr came under relentless questioning from Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee.Mr Barr stood by his handling of the report’s publication and his finding that President Donald Trump did not obstruct justice.His appearance at the committee took place hours after a letter from Mr Mueller to Mr Barr was released by Democrats. In the letter, Mr Mueller expressed his displeasure with the attorney general’s handling of his final report into his two-year investigation.In particular, he said the four-page summary of the report released by Mr Barr on March 24th “did not fully capture the context, nature and substance” of the report’s findings, and caused “public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation”.But questioned by senators on Wednesday, Mr Barr criticised Mr Mueller’s decision not to come to a conclusion about whether the president had obstructed justice. “I think that if he felt that he shouldn’t go down the path of making a traditional prosecutorial decision, then he shouldn’t have investigated,” he said.“We concluded that the evidence developed during the special counsel’s investigation was not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offence,” he said.‘Bit snitty’Towards the end of the hearing he also dismissed Mr Mueller’s letter as “a bit snitty”, adding that he believed it was written by one of his staff members.He said that he had phoned Mr Mueller after receiving the letter and the special counsel had said to him that his concern was not that Mr Barr had misrepresented the report, but that “the press was reading too much into it”.“He was very clear with me that he was not suggesting that we had misrepresented his report,” Mr Barr said, contradicting the contents of Mr Mueller’s letter.During hours of questioning in a packed Senate committee room, Mr Barr also clashed with senators about a passage in Mr Mueller’s report that states that White House counsel Don Mc Gahn had been told by Mr Trump twice during the summer of 2017 to tell the justice department to remove Mr Mueller because of conflicts of interest.Mr Mueller’s report quotes Mr McGahn as saying the president told him: “Mueller has to go.”Calls for resignationHowever, Mr Barr told the committee on Wednesday that “There is a distinction between saying to someone, ‘Go fire him, go fire Mueller,’ and saying, ‘Have him removed based on conflict’.”Mr Barr, who was appointed by Mr Trump to lead the Department of Justice earlier this year after he fired his first attorney general Jeff Sessions, reiterated his legal view that a president has a right to remove a special counsel.Following the hearing, several Democrats said Mr Barr should resign. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House of Representatives intelligence committee, said the attorney general had “misled the American people with his inaccurate summary of Mueller’s report, then he misled the Congress when he denied knowledge of Mueller’s concerns. How can he be trusted to impartially administer justice? He can’t”.While Mr Barr was also scheduled to appear before a House of Representatives committee on Thursday, it was still unclear late on Wednesday if he would do so due to a dispute over the format of the meeting."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignSketch of bearded man identified as second portrait of Leonardo da Vinci from his lifetimeHymns drop out of funeral song charts for the first

bearded man identified second portrait leonardo da vinci","story":"A portrait of Leonardo da VinciA sketch of a bearded man, held in the Royal Collection, has been identified as one of only two surviving portraits of Leonardo da Vinci made during his own lifetime. The picture, on a sheet of paper which also contains preparatory sketches by Leonardo, is thought to have been drawn shortly before his death in 1519.Showing the artist with a “well-kept and luxuriant beard” and “elegant straight nose”, he is described as appearing “a little melancholy and world-weary” in the rare depiction.The picture, now thought to have been drawn from life by an unnamed assistant of Leonardo, will now be displayed for the first time at the Queen\u0027s Gallery at Buckingham Palace after being authenticated by curators.Martin Clayton, head of prints and drawings at the Royal Collection Trust, identified the face as he prepared drawings which had been stored in Windsor Castle for the exhibition.Newly identified portrait of Leonardo da Vinci to go on display for the first timeOnly one other contemporaneous portrait of Leonardo is known to have survived, with this drawing considered to be a more private glimpse of the Renaissance artist.The other contemporary image of the artist is by his pupil, Francesco Melzi, and was produced at around the same time when Leonardo was around 65 years old.When comparing both, Clayton said, it\u0027s hard to avoid the conclusion that that is also an image of Leonardo. The face is on a sheet of paper which also contains the artist\u0027s studies of a horse\u0027s leg for an equestrian monument, commissioned by the French king.Martin Clayton, Head of prints and drawings, Royal Collection Trust  Clayton said: Sheets of paper could be picked up in the studio and used by Leonardo\u0027s assistants and companions just as rough paper for sketching on.The artist was rather unusual in having a beard and was renowned for his well-kept and luxuriant beard, Clayton added.He said: This very quick, casual sketch...is the closest that we get of a snapshot of Leonardo during his own lifetime.In 1968, art historian Kenneth Clark wrote that it was just conceivable that the portrait was of Leonardo when he compiled a catalogue of the drawings in the collection in 1968.The exhibition will also show studies of hands for the Adoration of the Magi by Leonardo da VinciBut the Royal Collection Trust said the suggestion went no further after this date, with the drawing returned to the archives for view only by scholars until being taken out again and reexamined ahead of the exhibition.The Buckingham Palace exhibition will mark the 500th anniversary of the artist\u0027s death and is the largest display of his work in more than 65 years.Leonardo da Vinci: A Life In Drawing runs from May 24 to October 13 at the Queen\u0027s Gallery, Buckingham Palace.Hymns drop out of funeral song charts for the first time Childhood obesity can now be predicted within months of a baby\u0026#39s birth Police chasing criminals in cars or on mopeds to get greater legal protection from prosecutionMan charged after the bodies of two women are found in the freezer of a London flatBoy, 15, stabbed to death in London as second teenager is found with injuriesPrincess Charlotte celebrates her fourth birthday with new pictures taken by the Duchess of CambridgeComment: Cabinet ministers usually have a licence to leak, but this appears to have overstepped the markPlanet Child, review: can a six-year-old really get the train to school alone?Forensics: the Real CSI, review: definitely not as glamorous as Jerry Bruckheimer\u0026#39s version Gavin Williamson sacked: How hunt for Huawei mole dug up a can of worms for Theresa MayJohn Bercow says he will not stay as Speaker for \u0026#39much longer\u0026#39 as fourth MP throws hat in ring to succeed himThe first British jail where there are no bars on the windows will open in 2021Comment: The Tories should be allying with Nigel Farage, not Jeremy CorbynComment: The Huawei leak was a story in the national interestGavin Williamson\u0026#39s sacking prompts unexpected cabinet reshuffle resulting in first female defence secretarySir Mark Sedwill: the architect of Gavin Williamson\u0026#39s sacking over Huawei leakGavin Williamson insists Theresa May has \u0026#39got the wrong person\u0026#39 after being sacked over Huawei leakReservist Penny Mordaunt becomes UK\u0026#39s first female Defence SecretaryMarcus Jones MP tells voters: Don\u0026#39t blame Conservative councillors for Brexit woes at WestminsterWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us says military intervention possible venezuela guaido calls","story":"Donald Trump’s administration has warned Russia to stop meddling in Venezuela and talked up the chance of US military action as a second day of clashes between protesters and security forces played out. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said that military involvement of some form is “possible” as he accused the Kremlin of convincing embattled president Nicolas Maduro to remain in post on Tuesday. John Bolton, the White House national security adviser, raised the possibility of fresh sanctions as he told Russia publicly that it had no business getting involved in the Venezuelan dispute. “This is our hemisphere. It\u0027s not where the Russians should be interfering. This was a mistake on their part,” Mr Bolton said. The Kremlin, which is backing Mr Maduro, in turn accused America of being behind an attempted “coup”, calling Washington’s actions a “gross violation of international law”.The US-Russia tensions flared as Juan Guaido, the 35-year-old opposition leader who declared himself interim president in January, once again took to the streets after urging a military uprising, despite violence leaving dozens injured the day before. Members of the Bolivarian National Guard who joined Venezuelan opposition leader and self-proclaimed acting president Juan Guaido fire into the air to repel forces loyal to President Nicolas MaduroIn Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, national guardsmen loyal to Mr Maduro roamed on motorcycles to control the demonstrations while tear gas was again used on the crowds.Mr Guaido had called for the biggest protests in the country’s history.  Supporters of Mr Maduro, the 56-year-old socialist leader, took to the streets as well.Mr Maduro was due to attend a rally and vowed that military figures who turned on him would not go “unpunished”. Tuesday’s calls by Mr Guaido for a military uprising had failed to topple Mr Maduro immediately and there were signs that some of those involved were seeking protection. Leopoldo Lopez, a well known opposition politician who escaped his house arrest and appeared in public on Tuesday, took refuge in the Spanish embassy. At least 25 Venezuelan troops have also applied for asylum in the Brazilian embassy.Maduro appears flanked by Venezuela\u0026#39s Defence Minister and two top military commanders in a photo released on Tuesday by the Miraflores Press OfficeTensions have been mounting between the US, one of more than 50 countries backing Mr Guaido’s claim to power, and Russia and Cuba, who support Mr Maduro and have been accused of propping him up. Mr Maduro denied a claim by Mr Pompeo that he was due to flee the country on Tuesday only to be convinced otherwise by the Russians. “Mr Pompeo, please, what lack of seriousness,” he said.The Russian foreign ministry also issued a denial, with spokesman Maria Zakharova calling it “absolute disinformation and fake news”. Mr Pompeo doubled down on the Trump administration’s instance for months that all options were on the table when it comes to US military action in Venezuela.The president has been crystal clear and incredibly consistent. Military action is possible. If that\u0027s what\u0027s required, that\u0027s what the United States will do, Mr Pompeo told Fox Business Network.An opposition demonstrator walks near a bus in flames during clashes with soldiers loyal to MaduroHe later talked to Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and urged the Kremlin to stop its “destabilising” actions, according to the State Department.Mr Lavrov in turn called US actions illegal, according to a read out from the Russian foreign ministry, and warned the continuation of aggressive steps is fraught with the most serious consequences”. With the Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro claiming a “crack” in the Venezuelan military had been revealed but Mr Maduro himself insisting commanders remained loyal, the Venezuelan president\u0027s chances of staying in office remain unclear. But some are predicting he could yet retain power. Sergio Gúzman, a Bogota based political risk analyst, told The : “I think the moment has gone for Guaido. Maduro may have lost some military support but the opposition is losing momentum at a greater rate.”Please review our commenting policyHymns drop out of funeral song charts for the first time Sketch of bearded man identified as second portrait of Leonardo da Vinci from his lifetimeChildhood obesity can now be predicted within months of a baby\u0026#39s birth Police chasing criminals in cars or on mopeds to get greater legal protection from prosecutionMan charged after the bodies of two women are found in the freezer of a London flatBoy, 15, stabbed to death in London as second teenager is found with injuriesPrincess Charlotte celebrates her fourth birthday with new pictures taken by the Duchess of CambridgeComment: Cabinet ministers usually have a licence to leak, but this appears to have overstepped the markPlanet Child, review: can a six-year-old really get the train to school alone?Forensics: the Real CSI, review: definitely not as glamorous as Jerry Bruckheimer\u0026#39s version Gavin Williamson sacked: How hunt for Huawei mole dug up a can of worms for Theresa MayJohn Bercow says he will not stay as Speaker for \u0026#39much longer\u0026#39 as fourth MP throws hat in ring to succeed himThe first British jail where there are no bars on the windows will open in 2021Comment: The Tories should be allying with Nigel Farage, not Jeremy CorbynComment: The Huawei leak was a story in the national interestGavin Williamson\u0026#39s sacking prompts unexpected cabinet reshuffle resulting in first female defence secretarySir Mark Sedwill: the architect of Gavin Williamson\u0026#39s sacking over Huawei leakGavin Williamson insists Theresa May has \u0026#39got the wrong person\u0026#39 after being sacked over Huawei leakReservist Penny Mordaunt becomes UK\u0026#39s first female Defence SecretaryWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/03/15/TELEMMGLPICT000191070798_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdEKusUCeKq9VS5XNTYK1PDHFr457yWWe8vtuBCymv1E.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"venezuela shows disastrously socialism always ends tyranny","story":"Venezuelans living in Colombia hold a demonstration against a massive blackout that has left millions without power in their countryFriedrich Hayek\u0027s The Road to Serfdom is playing out in the catastrophe engulfing Venezuela Writing in the midst of World War II, Friedrich Hayek warned, in his classic polemic The Road to Serfdom, that central planning and public ownership, the central tenets of a socialist economy, would, if left unchecked, descend slowly but inevitably into tyranny.

That pulled down revenues at Apple, which took in 5 per cent less than it did in the same period a year ago, it said in the new results.But the market was happy, as shares surged and Apple presented the results optimistically.That seems to be largely because of Apple\u0027s growing services business, onto which it has tried to switch attention recently. Faced with a decline in iPhone sales, and a technology market that is switching towards people paying for recurring services\u0026nbsprather than hardware with one-off big purchases, it has switched attention to subscriptions.Now, that appears to be working. The company so famous for the iPhone appears to have found a way to a future where it sells less, according to the latest results, with the money from people buying iPhones dropping and the money that people spend on those iPhones growing.As part of the results, Apple said its services business had hit\u0026nbsprecord success. Though it does not break down exactly which services are doing well, it has rolled out a whole host of paid-for services in recent times, including the introduction of a paid-for magazine and newspaper subscription service called News+ along side older services like Apple Music.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple has cancelled its AirPower wireless charging mat, which was slated as a way to charge numerous apple products at once India has claimed status as part of a super league of nations after shooting down a live satellite in a test of new missile technology5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Growth of output and new orders slowed, leading to job cuts for the third time in the past four months.“The trend in new export business was especially weak, as high stock holdings at clients and slower global economic growth led to reduced demand from key markets such as the European Union, the USA and China.”Brexit stockpiling continued to support production output as Britain\u0027s exit day remains uncertain, with a new deadline of October 31 to come up with a deal.Manufacturing employment declined for the third time in the past four months during April, with job losses attributed to “natural wastage, improved efficiency and workforce restructuring”.“Companies plan to use new product launches, new technologies and improved marketing strategies to drive growth forward in the coming months.“However, Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on plans, as some firms remain concerned about future growth prospects and the likely impact on output and demand from the unwinding of inventory positions later in the year,” Mr Dobson added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mike Ashley\u0027s Sports Direct has appionted an employee director The Government’s “world leading package of corporate reforms” have certainly generated some world leading excuse making on the part of Britain’s biggest companies.\u0026nbspWhen she entered Number 10 Downing Street, Theresa May looked like she might be poised to do something bold and radical on behalf of employees by giving them a voice in the boardroom, only to back pedal in the face of an intensive lobbying campaign.The end result was that companies were given a couple of cop outs. As an alternative to appointing employee directors, they could instead designate an existing non executive director to pretend to care about\u0026nbspworkers interests or set up an employees’ advisory panel.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s plan to put workers on boards comes from EUMike Ashley’s Sports Direct weighs up £61m Debenhams deal\u0027Mission led\u0027 Legal \u0026amp General has mission to thwart employee directorsA big problem\u0026nbspat the outset is that the measures were introduced via Britain\u0027s corporate governance code.\u0026nbspIt gives businesses\u0026nbspcarte blanche to ignore anything they don’t like as long as they say why they’re doing so under the principle of “comply or explain”.\u0026nbspWhen the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, whose members oversee £230bn of investments, conducted a survey of companies to find out how they were dealing with the new rules, nearly one in five (18 per cent) said they planned to ignore them. That’s where the world leading excuse will come\u0026nbspin.Of those planning to comply, just five per cent\u0026nbspsaid they would\u0026nbspappoint employee directors, with nearly three quarters (73 per cent) opting instead to hand the job to\u0026nbspexisting non executive directors. The remainder chose to convene advisory panels.\u0026nbspA look at the way some companies are handling the latter two suggests that they\u0027re treating the new requirements with rather less seriousness than you would hope.\u0026nbspMelrose, which controversially took over engineering group GKN a while back, has, for example, filled its panel not with workers but with the HR directors of the various manufacturing businesses it owns. \u0026nbspMediclinic, which operates private healthcare clinics in Southern Africa, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, has, meanwhile, appointed its former CEO Danie Meintjes to speak for employees in his new role as a non executive director. It’s hard to imagine a less appropriate person to serve as the voice of its workers than a company’s former boss.\u0026nbspThe LAPFF, which commendably supports reform, described its overall findings as “particularly disappointing given that no respondent to the survey considered the changes would be negative for the market or their company”.The sort of cynicism it has unearthed is, however, by no means true of all British companies. Transport operator FirstGroup has, for example, had an employee on its board for 30 years. I’ve talked to the group about its experience of this in the past and the response has been extremely positive.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

That’s right, Sports Direct. When it comes to employee representation none other than Mike Ashley is setting an example.\u0026nbspGiven the way the Sports Direct founder conducts his business, that serves as a rather damning indictment of the rest of corporate Britain, and of the government’s tepid efforts at reform.\u0026nbspThe LAPFF says it’s disappointed with its findings and hopes to see more “innovation” in future.

The numbers really aren\u0027t as good as they look\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentSainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe pleased the City with first set of results after the collapse of his planned merger with AsdaSainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe needed to pull a rabbit out of his hat after his attempt to merge the grocer with Asda was blown up by the Competition \u0026amp Markets Authority.With his full year\u0026nbspnumbers, he found\u0026nbspone. It’s just that a fluffy bunny is not the sort of thing that can be relied upon to keep the wolves from the door for long.\u0026nbspThe numbers Coupe unveiled contained much of what the City, which doesn’t tend to look much further than the end of its own nose, tends to coo over.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s boss favoured profit over logic in the Asda mergerCMA slays Sainsbury\u0027s, Asda attempt to create supermarket Thanos Sainsbury\u0027s £12bn merger with Asda blocked by regulatorUnderlying profits - which strip out all sorts of nasties such as the £48m blown on the failed Asda experiment - were up 7.8 per cent at £692m and so (crucially) was the idend. Debt was down, ditto underlying costs.\u0026nbspIt was better than analysts had expected and lit a fire under the shares, which were the biggest gainers on the FTSE 100 early on.\u0026nbspBut all those apparently fresh looking numbers need a little context. Let’s start with the shares. They’ve been bouncing around at near 30 year lows. Set against that, a 4 per cent boost to the price is like scoring a consolation goal in injury time to ease the pain of being down by five.\u0026nbspThen there’s the “underlying” number Sainsbury’s\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspso keen for people to focus their attention on. It excluded\u0026nbspfully £396m worth of supposedly “one off” items.\u0026nbspIn addition to the money the company blew on the deal, Sainsbury’s listed\u0026nbspcosts relating to guaranteed minimum pensions, retail restructuring, “Sainsbury’s Bank transition”, and the integration of Argos into the business.\u0026nbspAfter factoring them all in,\u0026nbspprofits\u0026nbspslumped by 41.6 per cent to just £239m. That’s a lot less fluffy than the underlying number Coupe was so keen to show off.\u0026nbspIt has risen for two years in a row but pre tax profits have been down for three. Given how regularly these “one offs” are hitting Sainsbury’s, how much meaning does that underlying number\u0026nbspreally have?\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Kantar’s authoritative retail survey has shown the group consistently losing market share.

Coupe has bought himself some breathing space. It will, however, prove temporary if he can’t stop Sainsbury’s from wilting. Make no mistake, that’s what it has been doing while he’s been he’s been off trying to strike a mega deal. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Growth of output and new orders slowed, leading to job cuts for the third time in the past four months.“The trend in new export business was especially weak, as high stock holdings at clients and slower global economic growth led to reduced demand from key markets such as the European Union, the USA and China.”Brexit stockpiling continued to support production output as Britain\u0027s exit day remains uncertain, with a new deadline of October 31 to come up with a deal.Manufacturing employment declined for the third time in the past four months during April, with job losses attributed to “natural wastage, improved efficiency and workforce restructuring”.“Companies plan to use new product launches, new technologies and improved marketing strategies to drive growth forward in the coming months.“However, Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on plans, as some firms remain concerned about future growth prospects and the likely impact on output and demand from the unwinding of inventory positions later in the year,” Mr Dobson added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

its first self-service outlet with no checkouts, what does it mean for Britain’s retail sector which employs more than any other part of the economy?Click to followThe IndependentStarting this week, shoppers at Sainsbury’s in High Holborn simply scan their own items using an app and then walk outAt a small, central London branch of Sainsbury’s, one mainstay of the traditional supermarket is notable by its absence: checkouts.Starting this week, shoppers in the High Holborn\u0026nbspbranch will simply scan their own items using an app and then walk out.\u0026nbspThe supermarket giant plans to use the trial to develop the app which it says will make grocery shopping quicker and more convenient.\u0026nbspBut it highlights a deepening trend towards fewer tills and ultimately fewer staff.So what might a new till-less future mean for British supermarkets and, more specifically, for the 2.7 million people who work in the retail industry?There’s little doubt stripping out tills from supermarkets will mean fewer jobs in retail, a sector that employs more than any other in the UK, comfortably ahead of the next largest employer, construction, with 1.8 million.Sainsbury’s has said the\u0026nbspnew setup merely frees up staff to spend time on the shop floor helping out customers and stocking shelves.\u0026nbspBut it would defy business logic to think retailers will keep on all of the 200,000 cashiers estimated to work in the UK when the need for them disappears.Created with Sketch.Ageing Japan: Robots\u0027 role in future of elderly care Show all 15Created with

biggest costs and one which they need to cut if they are to face up to the looming challenge of online retailers, including the mighty Amazon.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that around two-thirds of cashier jobs are at high risk of being replaced by technology. That would mean around 135,000 jobs disappearing.The new store format is more evolution than revolution.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s\u0026nbsphas already trialled its self-service app in other convenience stores and rivals including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and the\u0026nbspCo-op have piloted\u0026nbsptheir own equivalents.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, thousands of supermarket jobs have already gone at all of the big players as they battle discount chains like Lidl and Aldi which employ fewer checkout staff.It won’t have escaped anyone’s notice that supermarkets increasingly rely on self-service checkouts. The self-scan app is the next step on\u0026nbspthat trend.Why shell out on expensive till technology when most shoppers now have a portable barcode scanner in their pocket in the form of their smartphone?So the trend towards automation is well established, but it still has a long way to go.Large parts of the supply chain that brings food (and other products) to our doors could also be automated within the next decade or so.With artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robots, the technology to replace lorry drivers,\u0026nbspwarehouse workers and administrative staff is already here.\u0026nbspPerhaps half of jobs related to retail could be automated as that technology improves and costs comes down, according to some estimates.Created with Sketch.

Improving the efficiency of one of the most important parts of the economy should be welcomed and new jobs will be created as old ones disappear. But the impact of these changes depends hugely on how the process\u0026nbspis managed.\u0026nbspAutomation is frequently referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution”.The government must play a much more proactive role than in previous upheavals, actively forecasting the changes and proactively helping those affected into training and alternative employment rather than hiding behind the excuse that “market forces” will work their magic.It seems likely that they will, but that shop floor workers will still have a significant, if reduced, part to play.\u0026nbspUltimately it will come down to shoppers’ preferences. After all, supermarkets introduced (non-smartphone-based) self-scan apps in the\u0026nbsp1990s\u0026nbspbut the idea never really took off.Will we be willing to pay a little extra to go to a shop that has a few more staff that we can ask for assistance or will we go for the cheapest option?\u0026nbspThere’s almost certainly room for both. As many retailers well know, price is an important determinant of consumer behaviour but it is far from being the only one.\u0026nbspTherefore, there will be room for a no-frills, no-tills shopping experience\u0026nbspalongside more traditional offerings, perhaps with a relatively small number of highly knowledgeable retail assistants that online rivals can’t offer.Traditional retailers are increasingly switching on to the fact that our experiences\u0026nbspof shopping in a real-life store – the sights, sounds, textures and personal interactions – are their key advantage.So a future where we glide in solitary fashion through\u0026nbspthe aisles filling up our baskets without ever interacting with\u0026nbspanyone seems – thankfully – a little way off yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This information can help buyers make the right decision.”A Plusnet spokesperson said: “We’d like to apologise to our customers as we know this isn’t the service they’ve come to expect from us.“We worked with Ofcom to keep them informed and to ensure our customers received the best service through this difficult time.“This report refers to complaints during that time in October to December since then we’ve been working hard to get things back on track and the most recent complaints data shows that we are heading in the right direction.”TalkTalk said: “We’re pleased that Ofcom’s data again shows an improving trend for the number of complaints received about TalkTalk. And while some of the results in the quality of service report are disappointing, we are already seeing more customers than ever staying with us.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others stressed security, such as new encryption tools which will stop messages from being snooped on.But others just added other new fe\u0026nbspatures – including one that allows Facebook to tell people who is crushing on them.The app taking the lead in Facebook\u0027s new privacy-focused approach, Messenger has been made end-to-end encrypted by default for the first time, fully securing messages sent on the service.The app itself has also been completely rebuilt from the ground up, Facebook says, as part of a project called LightSpeed that will make the app smaller and quicker to download, as well as faster to load.A standalone desktop app for both Windows and Mac users is also being introduced, as is a new space in the Messenger app called Close Friends, where users can share messages and Stories with selected close friends and family.The world\u0027s largest social media platform is getting a redesign - with the trademark blue panels of the site being turned white.The company says the redesign, which will roll out later this year, will make the website simpler, faster, more immersive and puts your communities at the centre.The firm\u0027s Facebook Dating feature has also been updated to include a new Secret Crush feature, which will allow users to select up to nine people they\u0027re already friends with they can express interest in. If that person has opted into Facebook Dating they will receive a notification telling them someone has a crush on them. If they add the original user\u0027s name to their own list it will inform both parties of a match, otherwise, the interest will remain secret.The social network confirmed its first physical product - the Portal video calling device - is to start shipping internationally this year.The photo-sharing platform has confirmed it is testing a feature that hides the total number of likes on photos and videos to try and focus attention on posts rather than the likes they get. The feature will be initially tested in Canada.Shopping is also becoming more integrated into the app, with users able to start tapping on items they like in a post and buying it on the spot.The Camera mode is also being updated, with a Create feature that will enable users to add more creative stickers and effects to their posts.The business version of the messaging app is introducing catalogues, which will enable users speaking to firms via the app to browse product catalogues without leaving the platform.Facebook said the service was aimed at small businesses who may not have a website.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Eminem also raps: Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne.“I just like Em’s flow but don’t like that he’s dissing new rappers,” Bieber wrote. “I like the new generation of rap he just doesn’t understand it.”Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 32Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 432 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.532 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Eminem, 46, released\u0026nbspKamikaze\u0026nbspas a surprise in August last year. The album was certified platinum later in 2018.Combined with Eminem’s back catalogue,\u0026nbspKamikaze\u0026nbspmade him the top album seller of the year.Biebers’ most recent album,\u0026nbspPurpose, dates back to 2015.

Fans are hopeful the\u0026nbspidentity of the enigmatic H will be revealed following a devastating episode that saw Superintendent Ted Hastings end up behind bars.The latest outing saw the addition of Anna Maxwell Martin who plays Patricia Carmichael. Speaking on Zoe Ball’s Radio 2 show, the Bleak House actor revealed it was a struggle to learn her lines for the dialogue-heavy interrogation scenes.Created with Sketch.The best TV cliffhangers of all time Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.“It is quite hard,” she said. “I became hysterical throughout the whole process giggling the whole time, internally freaking out the whole time.\u0026nbspI don’t remember much, oh gosh.\u0026nbspI learned one hundred million lines so I blanked it out like a trauma.”Line of Duty concludes this Sunday at 9pm on BBC1Line of DutyThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And now the researchers have revealed early results from that study, published in a new paper in the\u0026nbspMonthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.The rock hit the moon while it was going\u0026nbsp61,000 kilometres an hour, they said, and left a crater behind that will be 10 to 15 metres across. When it hit, it did so with the force of 1.5 tonnes of TNT,\u0026nbspthrowing out debris that was as hot as 5400 degrees Celsius, roughly the same as the surface of the Sun.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

They are often travelling at very fast speeds when they arrive, meaning the rocks vapourise instantly and leave a plume of debris that can be seen even from Earth.Lunar eclipse stuns skygazers –\u0026nbspif they were able to see itThat flash\u0026nbspwas the first ever to be filmed during a lunar eclipse, despite repeated attempts by scientists.Something inside of me told me that this time would be the time, said Madiedo, who was impressed when he observed the event, as it was brighter than most of the events regularly detected by the survey.By analysing the flash using a vast set of telescopes, the researchers were able to conclude that the rock had a\u0026nbspa mass of 45kg, measured 30 to 60 centimetres across, and hit the surface at 61,000 kilometres an hour.The team plan to keep watching for such impacts in the future, and learning more about how they happen. As well as yielding important scientific information, such study will be necessary to ensure the safety of the astronauts who are expected to head back to the lunar surface in years to come.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

its first self-service outlet with no checkouts, what does it mean for Britain’s retail sector which employs more than any other part of the economy?Click to followThe IndependentStarting this week, shoppers at Sainsbury’s in High Holborn simply scan their own items using an app and then walk outAt a small, central London branch of Sainsbury’s, one mainstay of the traditional supermarket is notable by its absence: checkouts.Starting this week, shoppers in the High Holborn\u0026nbspbranch will simply scan their own items using an app and then walk out.\u0026nbspThe supermarket giant plans to use the trial to develop the app which it says will make grocery shopping quicker and more convenient.\u0026nbspBut it highlights a deepening trend towards fewer tills and ultimately fewer staff.So what might a new till-less future mean for British supermarkets and, more specifically, for the 2.7 million people who work in the retail industry?There’s little doubt stripping out tills from supermarkets will mean fewer jobs in retail, a sector that employs more than any other in the UK, comfortably ahead of the next largest employer, construction, with 1.8 million.Sainsbury’s has said the\u0026nbspnew setup merely frees up staff to spend time on the shop floor helping out customers and stocking shelves.\u0026nbspBut it would defy business logic to think retailers will keep on all of the 200,000 cashiers estimated to work in the UK when the need for them disappears.Created with Sketch.Ageing Japan: Robots\u0027 role in future of elderly care Show all 15Created with

biggest costs and one which they need to cut if they are to face up to the looming challenge of online retailers, including the mighty Amazon.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that around two-thirds of cashier jobs are at high risk of being replaced by technology. That would mean around 135,000 jobs disappearing.The new store format is more evolution than revolution.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s\u0026nbsphas already trialled its self-service app in other convenience stores and rivals including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and the\u0026nbspCo-op have piloted\u0026nbsptheir own equivalents.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, thousands of supermarket jobs have already gone at all of the big players as they battle discount chains like Lidl and Aldi which employ fewer checkout staff.It won’t have escaped anyone’s notice that supermarkets increasingly rely on self-service checkouts. The self-scan app is the next step on\u0026nbspthat trend.Why shell out on expensive till technology when most shoppers now have a portable barcode scanner in their pocket in the form of their smartphone?So the trend towards automation is well established, but it still has a long way to go.Large parts of the supply chain that brings food (and other products) to our doors could also be automated within the next decade or so.With artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robots, the technology to replace lorry drivers,\u0026nbspwarehouse workers and administrative staff is already here.\u0026nbspPerhaps half of jobs related to retail could be automated as that technology improves and costs comes down, according to some estimates.Created with Sketch.

Improving the efficiency of one of the most important parts of the economy should be welcomed and new jobs will be created as old ones disappear. But the impact of these changes depends hugely on how the process\u0026nbspis managed.\u0026nbspAutomation is frequently referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution”.The government must play a much more proactive role than in previous upheavals, actively forecasting the changes and proactively helping those affected into training and alternative employment rather than hiding behind the excuse that “market forces” will work their magic.It seems likely that they will, but that shop floor workers will still have a significant, if reduced, part to play.\u0026nbspUltimately it will come down to shoppers’ preferences. After all, supermarkets introduced (non-smartphone-based) self-scan apps in the\u0026nbsp1990s\u0026nbspbut the idea never really took off.Will we be willing to pay a little extra to go to a shop that has a few more staff that we can ask for assistance or will we go for the cheapest option?\u0026nbspThere’s almost certainly room for both. As many retailers well know, price is an important determinant of consumer behaviour but it is far from being the only one.\u0026nbspTherefore, there will be room for a no-frills, no-tills shopping experience\u0026nbspalongside more traditional offerings, perhaps with a relatively small number of highly knowledgeable retail assistants that online rivals can’t offer.Traditional retailers are increasingly switching on to the fact that our experiences\u0026nbspof shopping in a real-life store – the sights, sounds, textures and personal interactions – are their key advantage.So a future where we glide in solitary fashion through\u0026nbspthe aisles filling up our baskets without ever interacting with\u0026nbspanyone seems – thankfully – a little way off yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This information can help buyers make the right decision.”A Plusnet spokesperson said: “We’d like to apologise to our customers as we know this isn’t the service they’ve come to expect from us.“We worked with Ofcom to keep them informed and to ensure our customers received the best service through this difficult time.“This report refers to complaints during that time in October to December since then we’ve been working hard to get things back on track and the most recent complaints data shows that we are heading in the right direction.”TalkTalk said: “We’re pleased that Ofcom’s data again shows an improving trend for the number of complaints received about TalkTalk.

A 30-minute live performance at Tate ModernVictoria\u0026nbspPomery, director of the venue, said Stagecoach South East – which provides local buses\u0026nbsp– was good for the area, adding: “I think the service that they provide is first rate.”Pressed further, she added: “We have to take on board a whole range of issues when deciding our sponsorship. In this instance we decided that the role that the company plays in the area is very important.”Mr Farquharson later told the media: “I think that’s probably enough on sponsors.”Last year’s\u0026nbspTurner\u0026nbspPrize was won by Charlotte Prodger with her film, shot on an iPhone, about “queer identity” and her experience of coming out as gay in rural Scotland.The spotlight has also been thrown on other arts donations in recent months.In March, a £1m\u0026nbspdonation from The Sackler Trust to the National Portrait Gallery was cancelled, amid the opioid crisis in the US.The full shortlist for the Turner Prize 2018The Turner Prize’s 10 most memorable and outrageous winnersFollowing the press conference today, Stagecoach issued a statement, saying it “does not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind based on disability, gender, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, religion, belief, age, nationality, race or ethnic origin.“Our Stagecoach culture values transparency, ersity, and respect,” it said. “We expect our employees to commit to doing the right thing, to respect other iniduals at all times and treat them with dignity, and thoughtfulness, and we are committed to providing equal opportunities for all.”Turner\u0026nbspContemporary said it had “spearheaded the social and economic regeneration of Margate”, and added: “The gallery seeks to challenge assumptions, break down barriers and showcase artistic excellence.”Tate said that taking the\u0026nbspTurner\u0026nbspPrize to a new location every other year “wouldn’t be possible without the host venue raising local support, and the value local businesses bring to these venues is enormously important, both to the exhibition they stage and the education and community projects it inspires”.This year’s shortlist includes Lawrence Abu Hamdan,\u0026nbspwho conducted interviews with former detainees of a notorious Syrian jail.The other three nominees include London-based filmmaker Helen Cammock, Colombian-born sculptor Oscar Murillo,\u0026nbspand self-taught artist Tai Shani, who explores “feminine subjectivity and experience through a gothicscience-fiction lens”.The four shortlisted artists’ work will be displayed from 28 September 2019 to 12 January 2020 at\u0026nbspTurner Contemporary in Margate. The winner of the £40,000 prize will be announced on 3 December at an award ceremony, which will be broadcast live on the BBC.Additional reporting by agencies.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Operators say that\u0026nbspas a result, they need to make up that shortfall by charging customers instead.They say they also need to increase fees as consumers increasingly switch to contactless payments, meaning fewer people are using cash machines.But Link said there was no danger of free cashpoints disappearing.John Howells, the chief executive, said: “Free access to cash is vital for consumers and the UK enjoys extensive coverage that Link is committed to protecting.“There are more than 50,000 free-to-use ATMs across the UK, 10,000 more than we had in 2009, and currently 12,700 pay-to-use cash machines, down from over 23,000 in 2009.“Less than 3 per cent of withdrawals at Link ATMs incur a fee.”A spokeswoman for Cardtronics said: “The decision on whether to introduce a fee is taken on a case-by-case basis and reflects the economic viability of the inidual machine. We only ever charge a fee when there is no other option apart from removing the machine altogether.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We are talking about nothing less than the irreversible destruction of the environment within our lifetimes.”During the debate on the motion\u0026nbspenvironment secretary Michael Gove, who met with climate activists at Westminster on Tuesday, also said the government recognises “the situation we face is an emergency”, but stopped short of meeting Labour’s demands to officially declare one.High Court approves third runway at Heathrow despite climate crisisClimate activists describe Gove meeting as ‘less s*** than expected’Fight climate change on ‘war footing’ like defeat of Nazis, May toldSadiq Khan meets Extinction Rebellion protesters and pledges actionFracking tsar quits government post and blames eco activists“It is a crisis,” he added. “It is a threat that all of us have to unite to meet.”Mr Gove continued: “Five of the warmest years that this planet has endured have happened since 2010. The consequences for all of us are visible.“While statistics can sometimes be abstract and the impact can seem distant, we can all know that as inidual citizens and as parents that the next generation will face the consequences if we do no take action now to deal with climate change.”The cabinet minister also insisted the legislation will be introduced by the government “shortly” to ensure the UK has the “highest standards of environmental protection” as he claimed it would mark a “step change in how this country tackles the twin challenges of climate change and broader ecological degradation”.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it fails, it could be seen as evidence that he lacks the support he says he has. It might also encourage the authorities, which have already stripped him of parliamentary immunity and opened multiple investigations into him, to arrest him.In January Mr Guaido, the leader of\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s opposition-controlled National Assembly invoked the constitution to declare himself interim president, arguing that Mr\u0026nbspMaduro’s re-election in 2018 was illegitimate.The United States was among some 50 countries that recognise Mr Guaido as\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s president, and\u0026nbspimposed sanctions to try to dislodge Mr Maduro, but the president has so far clung to power.Donald Trump has yet to comment on the uprising, although the White House confirmed he was “monitoring the ongoing situation and secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u0026nbspsaid the US government “fully supports” Mr Guaido’s call for military backing.A former US\u0026nbspofficial said that while it was unclear of Mr Guaido’s efforts would trigger a broader military uprising, it appeared aimed at building momentum towards mass protests planned for Wednesday.Mr\u0026nbspGuaido has said the May Day demonstrations “the largest march in\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s history” and\u0026nbsppart of the “definitive phase” of his effort to take office in order to call fresh elections.Mr Maduro has accused Mr Guaido of being a\u0026nbspUS-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup. The government has arrested Mr Guaido’s top aide, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and opened multiple probes. It has also barred him from leaving the country, a ban Mr Guaido openly violated earlier this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Idealistic young voters are all ears.There is a solution to our looming energy crisis — cheap, clean shale gas. But feeble Energy Secretary Greg Clark threw it away, forcing fracking tsar Natascha Engel to quit yesterday in disgust.After nine dithering years in power, with no idea how to keep the lights on, this Government is damned now whichever way it jumps.Protesters claiming “The End Is Nigh” are swarming like angry wasps.Their claims may be simplistic and sometimes , but they have been nailed on Netflix by national treasure Sir David Attenborough and hammered home by Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg.Jezza is using these crowd-pullers to turn dull carbon emissions into a glittering crusade — a national emergency no less.His Momentum Marxists are tutoring the Extinction Rebellion protesters who gridlocked London and turned -year-old Greta into a global warming superstar. The Tories have nothing to say.Gutless Clark abandoned fracking contractors who risked hundreds of million only to see Project Shale strangled at birth.Engel’s walk-out should surprise nobody. I received a frantic call from the ex-Labour MP weeks ago warning about “nonsense” rules which stop fracking at the slightest tremor.She told me: “This is a real threat to the industry and means buying more Russian gas.” Her argument doesn’t wash with Jezza’s anti-capitalist anarchists, Greta or Blue Planet’s Sir David, who between them now run UK energy policy.Arguments for shale have been drowned out by images of raging bushfires, tidal waves and an Apocalypse Now soundtrack.Saint David’s bell tolls, and it tolls for the Tories.Climate change is the issue of the day. They have thrown in the towel on this as on so much .Greta Thunberg is Sweden’s new dancing queen, upstaging gas-guzzling hypocrite Emma Thompson and treating Britain’s top ministers with withering sarcasm.They were doing NOTHING to reduce carbon emissions, she spat. In truth, Britain is leading Europe, at huge cost, in reducing carbon emissions while replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy. Wind and solar energy are replacing coal.It is also a fact, courtesy of the respected Intergovern- mental Panel On Climate Change, that global warming is not about to roast us all alive or drown us beneath stormy oceans.Polar bears are multiplying, not disappearing. Walruses are thriving, not throwing themselves off rocks.None of this washes with single-issue, black-and-white zealots who regard all inconvenient truth as the work of the Devil. I am no climate change denier. We are polluting the water we drink and the air we breathe.If I ruled the world, Russia, China, India and America would not turn oceans and rivers into chemical sewers.I would ban plastic dumping, save sea le from being choked or poisoned and halt deforestation and desert- ication. But I don’t rule the world, and nor does Saint David or Greta Thunberg — or the hundreds of, let’s say, well-intentioned young folk who think paralysing London is the next best thing.Britain deserves credit for cutting carbon emissions further and faster than most EU countries.Temperatures are rising, but not by Extinction Rebellion or Miss Thunberg’s worst-case projections.Evangelical followers want an end to air travel except when they go skiing.Everything must come by sea even though shipping is a highly polluting form of transport.We must grow our own food, putting farmers in poor countries out of a job and workers here on the dole.WARREN BUFFETT, the legendary Sage of Omaha, has amassed billions putting his money where his mouth is.He thinks Britain, with its rule of law and decent, hard-working citizens is the world’s best place to invest, regardless of Brexit.He’s not alone. Once Brexit is settled, a wall of money will be unleashed by firms at home and abroad who have been sitting on the fence for three years.There is only one fly in the ointment – the prospect of anti-Semitic, US-hating, terrorist-backing Jeremy Corbyn as our next PM.Jezza’s much brighter brother Piers deserves a final say on this sudden burst of mass hysteria and Greta worship.“Listening to an ignorant, brainwashed child is deranged,” he tweets. “I am an actual scientist of physics, meteorology, astrophysics and climate and say Greta Thunberg is wrong.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It could also hand Britain an economic boom, and reduce our dependence on energy imports from far-flung dictatorships.Cowardly Business Secretary Greg Clark is squandering this windfall by giving in to the green lobby. As Engel says — listen to the science, not just to those who shout the loudest.At least the Tories aren’t quite as bad as Jeremy Corbyn, who would ban fracking altogether and destroy hundreds of jobs in the process.It is time the Government ignored leftie posturing and turned on the shale gas taps.THE five thugs suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence have repeatedly dodged justice. So it’s an outrage they’ve been allowed to run up nearly £million in legal aid — funded, of course, by the taxpayer.Gary Dobson and David Norris lied for  years before finally being convicted of murder, while the other three have always refused to explain their role in the racist attack on Stephen.Of course every suspect has the right to a defence, but it can’t be fair that such sums have been lavished on lawyers for these fundamentally dishonest men.Contrast this state-funded generosity with the treatment of Stephen’s grieving parents, who were denied legal aid when trying to get justice for their son.Coming hot on the heels of Shamima Begum’s legal aid windfall, this is fresh proof the system isn’t working. Legal aid is meant to ensure the right to a fair trial, not help killers avoid being held to account.LEEDS United boss Marcelo Bielsa has restored faith in modern football.His players were wrong to score against Aston Villa while their opponents had a man down injured, but he immediately put it right by gting Villa an equaliser.You could see on Bielsa’s face how much it hurt. The gesture was the final nail in the coffin for Leeds’ automatic promotion challenge — and an incredible example for footie-mad kids who need to know the importance of fair play.In an era where sport stars hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons, it’s heart-warming to see a team go about things the right way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Once she was hooked in, the messages rapidly escalated to “Jason” telling her he loved her and that, surprise surprise, he was having some financial dficulties and needed help because a film payment had been delayed.He added, and I write this verbatim: “I really need you to do this for me honey I can’t trust anyone but you with my money honey.”At this point, did alarm bells ring that she was, in fact, ­conversing with the Hunny ­Monster  Nope, seems not.So, over a period of time, she sent “a substantial amount which would have made a dference to my le and my family”.I’m torn between sympathy and utter disbelief that someone could be so naive.Online fraud is now an epidemic and plenty have lost money in scams so sophisticated that even the most tech-savvy would struggle to spot them.It’s a world away from the ­early-day scams of someone in Nigeria claiming to have a ­fortune locked away in an account they can only accessyou can just send £squillion right now.But what of “Jason Statham” and his like or, worse, the ones who frequent dating sites in the hope of carrying out their sting in person Barely a week goes by when we don’t read a story of someone who thought they had met the partner of their dreams . . . only to discover, several thousand pounds and a whole lot of heartbreak later, that they weren’t who they claimed to be.It goes without saying that loss or loneliness can sometimes make us throw caution to the wind in our search for love.But common sense must always be preserved.FORMER principal ballet dancer Dame Gillian Lynne has left £.million in her will.A robust fortune garnered from her role as choreographer for smash-hit musicals such as Cats and Phantom Of The Opera.Gillian’s path to success is a salutary lesson for anyone currently despairing that their child is struggling at school.When Gillian was young, her mother was concerned about her lack of concentration, and therefore progress, in lessons.So she took her daughter to see a child behavioural specialist who, after a few routine questions, switched on the radio and told Gillian that he and her mother were going to step outside for a while.Once in the corridor, they peeped through the window and watched as Gillian started moving to the music.“There’s nothing wrong with your daughter,” he concluded. “She’s a dancer. Take her to dance school.”Sadly, around  years on, the State still fails to understand that creativity is as important as literacy in giving kids the best chance of a happy, successful adulthood.When you have a spare  minutes, watch Sir Ken Robinson’s TED talk asking: “Do schools kill creativity ”They can, and plenty do.

Its author is not your standard liberal conscience, ­cloistered in Whitehall or a university sociology department.  Baroness Helen Newlove knows only too well what it is like to be a victim of crime.Twelve years ago she was an ordinary mum living in a suburb of Warrington, Cheshire, when her husband left their home to confront a group of drunken youths who were vandalising his car. He never ed.He was kicked and beaten so savagely that he later died in hospital.What was especially galling for his we and three daughters was that the three youths responsible —  who were each jailed for le — had been the ­subject of numerous complaints.One of those jailed for Garry’s murder had already been on an assault charge but had been released on bail just a few hours earlier to resume his le ­terrorising local residents.Neither police, prosecutors nor the courts seemed to appreciate just how far out of control the youths had become.They failed to put together numerous complaints of antisocial behaviour to see the overall picture. As a result, the problem was allowed to escalate to its murderous conclusion.Sadly, to judge by Baroness Newlove’s report, too little has changed in the years since her first husband’s ­murder. Still, she says, police are treating complaints about anti- social behaviour as isolated incidents, each dismissed as “low-level crime”.A vandalised car is treated as a problem to be sorted out with an insurance claim.  Youths riding motorbikes round a children’s playground might be challenged by police on one ­occasion but it is never followed up.  Dope-smoking seems effectively to have been legalised, the police ­having all but given up even speaking to those involved. At the same time, incidents of antisocial behaviour are  rising sharply.Last year,  per cent of people responding to the British Crime Survey — an annual poll of more than , randomly-selected Britons — reported witnessing antisocial behaviour, up from . per cent the year before.This wasn’t how it was supposed to be.In  the Government introduced what it called a “community trigger” — which was supposed to give residents the right to demand greater actionthree or more separate reports on antisocial behaviour were received within a six-month period.Residents can demand a “case review”, at which the authorities must explain what action they intend to take.Yet in half of local authority areas, says Newlove, the community trigger process was not used during  .Newlove also has a gripe with the police  service — the non-emergency number introduced in .  It was ­supposed to encourage us to report non-le-threatening incidents for which we might be reluctant to call .But, as I found from my own experience, it seems to be used as a means of fobbing us off.When I came across someone stealing from a pile of wood by the roadside I rang the number —  but it took ages to have the call answered and even when it was, nothing  happened, even though I had taken down the registration plate of the thieves’  vehicle.To cap the insult, while  calls are free it costs p to call .Of course, police can’t be expected to deal with and solve every single crime. I know that officer numbers have fallen and that in some areas they are struggling with an epidemic of kne murders, which obviously needs to take priority.Butyou give people the impression that you are no longer even bothering to try to police “low-level” crime, you are just inviting the problem to escalate.It isn’t just the police, however, who are responsible for the lack of action on antisocial behaviour. Local authorities have filled their town centres with enforcement officers, who merrily hand out £ fines for the smallest misdemeanours, such as dropping fag ends.Yet the private firms trusted with ­dealing with litter louts — and who are disgracefully often employed on contracts which incentivise them to hand out as many fines as  possible — are not  interested in policing housing estates.They are only interested in what they find profitable — dishing out fines to soft targets in shopping centres.Serious antisocial behaviour of the sort which preceded Garry Newlove’s murder falls between two stools — it is considered too much bother for enforcement officers but not serious enough for police investigation.But as Baroness Newlove knows only too well, turning a blind eye to repeated antisocial behaviour makes the lives of residents a misery and can end up ­having fatal consequences.The Government has been quick to respond to proposals from the usual bleeding-heart liberals who seem to run the criminal justice system — recently agreeing, for example, to look into ­abolishing prison sentences of less than six months.Ministers must take note of what the outgoing Victims’ Commissioner is saying on the lax approach to antisocial ­behaviour and put the interests of the victims, not criminals, first. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is something I really do care about.The ambition for the new Kantor Centre of Excellence is hugely inspiring. The bringing together of research, education, practice and policy, all in one place, will take Anna Freud Centre’s mission to the next level.It is testament to what can be achieved when people work together to realise a shared vision.The centre will provide training for professionals and postgraduate teaching for the leaders of tomorrow.The school combines mental health care and education for children aged five to  in a setting where a parent joins their child in the classroom.The centre is named after Anna Freud, the pioneer of child psychoanalysis - and daughter of the famous psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud - who was instrumental in its creation.She set up the Hampstead War Nurseries in  in response to the social and emotional upheaval faced by children in wartime, and over the decades it developed into a centre of teaching and research and a major service provider.Professor Peter Fonagy, chief executive of the Anna Freud Centre, said: Childhood mental health disorders have reached unacceptably high levels.

who was swept back into power in January following controversial elections deemed illegitimate by many countries.Guaido was joined by Venezuelas most-prominent opposition activist Leopoldo Lopez in a three-minute video to announce the coup yesterday morning.Lopez was apparently released from house arrest by soldiers who defected to the growing anti-government cause and were now answering to Guaido.In the video, Lopez declared: I want to tell the Venezuelan people: This is the moment to take to the streets and accompany these patriotic soldiers.And Guaido said of his defecting military supporters: The armed forces have taken the right decision.With the support of the Venezuelan people and the backing of our constitution they are on the right side of history.The calls kicked off a day of bloody clashes as thousands took to the streets just blocks away from president Maduros presidential palace.The violent street battles that erupted in parts of Caracas were the most serious challenge yet to Maduros rule.While the rebellion seemed to have garnered only limited military support Guaido sought to keep the momentum going at the end of the day by calling for people to take to the streets again today.Yesterday, Guaido and Lopez coordinated actions in the capital from a highway overpass - while troops loyal to Maduro fired tear gas from inside the adjacent air base.A crowd that quickly swelled to a few thousand scurried for cover, reappearing later with Guaido at a plaza a few blocks from the skirmishes.A smaller group of masked youths stayed behind on the highway, lobbing rocks and Molotov cocktails toward the air base and setting a government bus on fire.The head of a medical centre near the site of the street battles said doctors were treating  people, about half of them with injuries suffered from rubber bullets.Venezuelan human rights group Provea said a -year-old man was shot and killed during an anti-government protest in the city of La Victoria.As Maduros forces repelled the action, Lopez and his family sought refuge in the Chilean ambassadors residence in Caracas before moving to the Spanish embassy.Maduro tried to project an image of strength, saying he had spoken to several regional military commanders who reaffirmed their loyalty.He wrote on Twitter: Nerves of steel!But the head of Venezuelas secret police penned a letter breaking ranks with the embattled leader.Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figuera, the head of Venezuelas feared SEBIN intelligence agency, said it was now time to rebuilt the country.He added: The hour has arrived for us to look for other ways of doing politics.To build the homeland our children and grandchildren deserve.Governments from around the world expressed support for Guaido while repeating calls to avoid violence.US National Security Adviser John Bolton said the Trump administration had received assurances from three key Maduro officials that the president would be removed peacefully.Mr Bolton declined to discuss possible military actions - but said that all options are on the table as President Trump monitors developments minute by minute.President Trump had tweeted: I am monitoring the situation in Venezuela very closely.The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom!The uprising has been fuelled by popular resentment at political corruption in the country still wracked with poverty despite it having the worlds largest oil reserves.When oil prices crashed in , the Venezuelan government had not used the prosperous years to build up reserves to fall back on.Large areas of the collapsing country have been left in the dark for days at a time by power outages.More than three million Venezuelans have fled in recent years.Maduro has strongly resisted calls for an early vote or that he leave power early before his six-year second term ends in , sparking huge anti-government demonstrations.Venezuelas socialist party boss, Diosdado Cabello, called on government supporters to amass at the presidential palace to defend Maduro from what he called a small uprising of traitorous military soldiers backed by the US.He desperately tried to downplay the signicance of the rebellion, saying Caracas is calm and that the air base near where the rebellious soldiers are gathered had not been touched.Cabello said the opposition had not been able to take over the air base, which he said remained absolutely under the operational control of the government.Meanwhile supporters of UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn — a vocal admirer of the embattled socialist regime — dubbed the uprising a Pincohet-style coup.Corbynista MP Chris Williamson said: It appears that the USA is ramping up its efforts to overthrow the legitimate and democratically elected President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, in a military coup.I stand in full solidarity with the people of Venezuela against this attack on their democracy and sovereignty.The middle ranks are earning around  to  a month, and that is impacting their own structure, said one expert on Venezuelas armed forces.The military has also struggled to maintain its equipment as it suffers from a shortage of spare parts.According to some analysts, intelligence agents are also embedded among the military forces to guard against anti-regime activity.Those troops  who support the opposition have been accused of betrayal and have been arrested, according to Human Rights Watch.Authorities have also arrested the family members of some suspects in an effort to determine their whereabouts, the rights group said.Guaido, the leader of Venezuelas opposition-controlled National Assembly, in January invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency.He argued that Maduros re-election in  was illegitimate.Around  countries including the United States have recognised Guaido as Venezuelas interim president.Maduro calls Guaido a US-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup.The government has arrested his top aide, stripped Guaido of his parliamentary immunity and barred him from leaving the countryLast week, Guaido said his congressional ally - opposition lawmaker Gilber Caro - had been detained, and that  members of his team had been summoned to appear before the Sebin intelligence agency."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000332699416.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mum swindled 70k from employer disneyworld","story":"Charlotte Clton, , doctored payments to suppliers and staff to fund the holiday, as well as meals out and her beautician course.She wept in the dock as she was handed a -month sentence, which the judge said she would serve at least six months of behind bars.The mum-of-three was accounts manager at County Gates Ltd, a small business based in Stockport that provides custom gates, railings, balconies and other metalwork.She was responsible for paying weekly wages to staff and suppliers, Minshull Street Crown Court heard.Before Christmas  a routine check of payments was carried out before the firm closed for the holidays.It was discovered that one payment went into Cltons account instead of to suppliers, according to Manchester Evening News.A company investigation then found that there were  fraudulent transactions disguised as payments to staff and suppliers.The sum of the money was £,, which the judge said the small firm could ill afford.She used some of the money to become qualied in doing non-surgical cosmetic procedures, which allowed her to set up shop as a self-employed beautician.Huw Edwards, defending, said she made the first few payments because of her dire financial position but became greedy when she got away with it.He urged the judge not to send her straight to prison.Mr Edwards said Clton, who has no previous convictions and three children, was genuinely remorseful for her actions and would be greatly affectedshe was jailed.Nicholas Clarke QC, told her that her -month sentence could not be suspended.He said: You indulged yourself at the expense of your employer, who trusted you explicitly.As accounts manager you were responsible for paying suppliers and staff wages.

It is important for us to be looking at the new models that are available.“It’s also all too often framed in terms of existing language which people take to mean certain things.“Often people will use the terms customs union and have in their mind dferent things about what that achieves.”Mrs May added: “We are sitting down and talking about what both sides both want to achieve in relation to customs.“Can we come to an agreement on that  I hope we will, but those discussions continue.”In a unique display of cross-party Brexit unity, Labour chiefs reinforced Mrs May’s words last night to suggest a customs compromise was in the offing.Mr Corbyn’s spokesman said: “There is more than one way to skin a cat in terms of the Government moving off its position on a customs union.“The name isn’t the most important thing.”During the  minute session with the MPs, the PM also clashed with both Remainer and Brexiteer critics.Arch Tory Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash told her: “You’ve just said you want to leave the EU.

He said: “This can act as a wake up call to ensure that children can be set on the right road, with healthier habits.”Other key predictors are diabetes and smoking during pregnancy, and whether the child’s parents are also fat.Prof Vrijkotte hopes the test will help medics identy children at higher risk so they can act early to prevent poor health.She said many parents would be shocked by the tool’s predictions.Speaking at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow, she added: “It is so dficult to lose weight so I think we should focus on prevention, so that children can become healthy adults.“I think we should start earlier than two years old... to use these kinds of tools in discussing with the parents, when the infant does not have a problem yet.”CHATTY parents are more likely to have brainier kids with larger vocabularies, a study found.Tots exposed to more adult words aged two to four performed better in thinking, numeracy and shape awareness tests.They also used a greater iety of words themselves.Researchers fitted tiny sound recorders into the clothing of  pre-school children and monitored them at home for three days.Mums, dads and other carers also completed activities with the kids, such as drawing, copying and matching tasks.Analysis revealed children with the most talkative parents scored highest.Those who were encouraged to explore and express themselves were also less likely to be restless, aggressive and disobedient.Study leader Katrina d’Apice, from the University of York, said recording the children at home gave better results than previous lab-based tests.She added: “We found that the quantity of adult spoken words that children hear is positively associated with their cognitive ability.“However, further research is needed to explore the reasons behind this link.“It could be that greater exposure to language provides more learning opportunities for children.“But it could also be the case that more intelligent children evoke more words from adults in their environment.”Prof Sophie von Stumm, who also worked on the study, said: “This study is the largest naturalistic observation of early le home environments to date.“We found that the quantity of adult spoken words that children were exposed to ied greatly within families.“Some kids heard twice as many words on one day as they did on the next.”The findings are published in the journal Developmental Psychology.Possible interventions include diet changes or more exercise to reduce their obesity risk.Commenting on the study Dr Max Davie, Officer for Health Improvement at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “Any model that accurately predicts an increased likelihood of developing obesity allows us to intervene and provide targeted weight management support and advice at an earlier stage.“We know that overweight children are more likely to become overweight adults with an increased risk of serious health problems, so being able to identy and help young children at risk would go some way towards protecting their health in the future.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

DOWNING STREET LONDON SWA AA THE PRIME MINISTER  May  Dear Gavin  Thank you for your time this evening. We discussed the investigation into the unauthorised disclosure of information from the National Security Council meeting on  April. This is an extremely serious matter, and a deeply disappointing one. It is vital for the operation of good government and for the UK’s national interest in some of the most sensitive and important areas that the members of the NSC — from our Armed Forces, our Security and Intelligence Agencies, and the most senior level of Government — are able to have frank and detailed discussions in full confidence that the advice and analysis provided is not discussed or ulged beyond that trusted environment. That is why I commissioned the Cabinet Secretary to establish an investigation into the unprecedented leak from the NSC meeting last week, and why I expected everyone connected to it — Ministers and officials alike — to comply with it fully. You undertook to do so. I am therefore concerned by the manner in which you have engaged with this investigation. It has been conducted fairly, with the full co-operation of other NSC attendees. They have all answered questions, engaged properly, provided as much information as possible to assist with the investigation, and encouraged their staff to do the same. Your conduct has not been of the same standard as others’. In our meeting this evening, I put to you the latest information from the investigation, which provides compelling evidence suggesting your responsibility for the unauthorised disclosure. No other, credible version of events to explain this leak has been identied. It is vital that I have full confidence in the members of my Cabinet and of the National Security Council. The gravity of this issue alone, and its ramications for the operation of the NSC and the UK’s national interest, warrants the serious steps we have taken, and an equally serious response. It is therefore with great sadness that I have concluded that I can no longer have full confidence in you as Secretary of State for Defence and a Minister in my Cabinet and asked you to leave Her Majesty’s Government. As you do so, I would like to thank you for the wider contribution you have made to it over the last three years, and for your unquestionable personal commitment to the men and women of our Armed Forces. Yours Sincerely  Theresa May   The Right Honourable Gavin Williamson CBE MP Gavin Williamsonaposs reply:Dear Prime Minister,It has been a great privilege to serve as Defence Secretary and Chief Whip in your Government. Every day I have seen the extraordinary work of the men and women of our armed forces, who go to incredible s to defend our country.I am sorry that you feel recent leaks from the National Security Council originated in my Department. I emphatically believe this was not the case. I strenuously deny that I was in any way involved in this leak and I am confident that a thorough and formal inquiry would have vindicated my position.I have always trusted my civil servants, military advisers and staff. I believe the assurances they have given me.I appreciate you offering me the option to resign, but to resign would have been to accept that I, my civil servants, my military advisers or my staff were responsible: this was not the case.Restoring public confidence in the NSC is an ambition we both share. With that in mind I hope that your decision achieves this aim rather than being seen as a temporary distraction.As I said there has been no greater privilege than working with our armed forces and I will continue to stand up for our service personnel and the superb work they do.Yours ever,Gavin"},{"url":null,"title":"tories could lose 800 council","story":"NewsJeremy Corbyn says bickering will cost Tories as party faces  seat wipeoutJeremy Corbyn has accused the Theresa May government of bickering while the public suffers at the hands of austerityShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsTheresa May is set to have yet another bad week \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Tories are on the brink of a local election meltdown tomorrow as voters go to the polls across the country. Theresa May’s party could lose around  council seats inflicting further misery on the already battered Conservatives. And the Prime Minister knows a disastrous day at the polls could hasten her departure.  Her only silver lining is that Nigel Farage’s Brexit party is not standing and UKIP is only putting up candidates in one in six seats. Speaking to the Mirror, Jeremy Corbyn accused ministers of “bickering and jostling” while the country suffered from austerity. “People don’t feel like what’s going on in Westminster has any bearing on their lives,” he said.    Voters are desperately concerned by the social care crisis, rising crime, the plight of high streets and school cuts. But Mr Corbyn added: “In their front rooms TVs have blared about the mess Theresa May has made of the Brexit negotiations and plots to depose her.”The Labour leader is hoping to show the momentum is with his party by clocking up over  gains. But he acknowledged that the elections could be “tough” for Labour too with Brexit “overshadowing” everything. And party insiders suggested polling expertsapos predictions the Tories could lose more than  seats were “way off”.  This set of elections were last fought on the day of the  general election, when turn-out was high and David Cameron won a small majority.    A lower turnout nearly always disproportionately hits the Labour vote. The elections are also predominantly in Leave-voting Tory heartlands that could punish Labour over its second referendum stance.   In a plea to voters, Mr Corbyn said: “Today people have the chance to elect caring and hardworking Labour councillors and mayors to show Theresa May and the Conservatives that after nine years of running down and cutting vital services, there is an alternative.” Some , seats are up for grabs in  councils in England.

And they were published too late for , ex-Tax Credit claimants who have already been moved onto UC through a change in circumstances.  Mr Sharma claimed the Department for Work and Pensionsmade a mistake in withholding the report from the public for more than a year. He did not explain how the scandal happened, but told MPs on the Commons Work and Pensions Committee: Certainly it was a mistake. We should have published this earlier, I’m not going to defend that.” The Employment Minister added: In terms of that report, to be very up front with you, absolutely we collectively dropped the ball on that. “The intention was that should have been published earlier.  “We are making sure we have systems in place to make sure we don’t make that kind of mistake again.” It came as MPs quizzed chiefs on the movement of millions of existing benefit claimants onto Universal Credit. They have raised fears over the hundreds of thousands of existing claimants whoaposve already been shunted onto UC due to changing circumstances. However, aposmanaged migrationapos of other existing benefit claimants has been stalled until  due to concerns about the system. Today UC Director-General Neil Couling admitted the date could not be brought forward any earlier. He said his team was full of mechanics with their hands in the engine, attempting to move claimants off IT systems conceived in the late s and built in the s. He described UC as the biggest digital development in Western Europe - and warned that once aposmanaged migrationapos begins, it will happen at breakneck speed. He told MPs: “The reason why it’s tricky and I’ve asked for the time to do this to the middle of  is because you go straight to a high volume. “As soon as we switch it on, in that week the run-ons will apply to ,-odd cases.

Mother-of-three Charlotte Clton doctored payments to suppliers and staff to funnel tens of thousands of pounds into her own account.Clton wept in the dock as the judge told her she would serve at least six months behind bars for her deception, reports the Manchester Evening News.The -year-old worked as accounts manager at County Gates Ltd, a small business based at Chadkirk Industrial estate in Romiley, Stockport, that provides custom gates, railings, balconies and other metalwork. She was responsible for paying suppliers and the weekly staff wages, Minshull Street Crown Court heard. In December , a routine check of payments was carried out before the firm closed for Christmas. It was discovered that the bank account details on one payment were not that of the supplier, but Cltonaposs.    A more detailed examination revealed  fraudulent transactions disguised as wages payments or payments to suppliers. The total amount of money funnelled out of the company was said to be over £,, a sum a judge said companies of that size could aposill affordapos. Police said Clton used to the money to obtain qualications for non-surgical cosmetic procedures, which have enabled her to start up her own business as a self-employed beautician. She also spent the money on days out, eating out and even booked a family holiday to Disneyworld in the US, they added. Clton, of Dorking Close, Stockport, admitted one count of fraud at an earlier hearing. Huw Edwards, defending, said Clton made the first few payments due to her then aposdire financial positionapos, but because she aposgot away with itapos, she aposbecame greedyapos and carried on taking money, which she began to rely on. He said Clton, who has no previous convictions, was aposgenuinely remorsefulapos and urged the judge not to send her straight to prison. Mr Edwards said Clton has three children, who would be greatly affectedshe was jailed. I cannot think of a more worthy candidate to have her sentence suspended, her offending behaviour aside, he added. Clton wept in the dock as the judge, Recorder Nicholas Clarke QC, told her a -month sentence could not be suspended. She will serve half her sentence in prison and the rest on licence. He told her: You indulged yourself at the expense of your employer, who trusted you explicitly. As accounts manager you were responsible for paying suppliers and staff wages. This offence was sophisticated and involved the altering of records.    It was devious and quite deliberate. The total amount is signicant, over £,, which small family firms can ill-afford. There is a perception that fraud is a faceless crime but this case is a good example that most certainly is not. The company told police: Charlotte was a well-liked and trusted member of staff. We are shocked at the level of deception Charlotte has shown herself capable of. We had concerns because although we were busy and had plenty of customers, we were only making a minimal profit. Charlotte knew that we were cutting back. Despite this, she has continued to take from us. A Proceeds of Crime Acthearing will be held at a later date to begin to try and reclaim the money.

Neal, from Blackburn, Lancashire, claims he can touch his next door neighbouraposs wall by sticking his arm out of his upstairs window.    Blackburn with Darwen Council planning officials approved the extension and maintain there was no fault in the decision making process. The neighbours, a family of six, had the extension done before moving in a year ago according to Neal, who said he has no relationship with them.

Now, with Meghan Markle due any day now, the spotlight has fallen once again on the rights and wrongs of expecting new royal mums to face the media hours after giving birth.Some think itaposs the price you pay for a le of immense, largely public-funded privilege. Others feel itaposs completely inhumane to ask a mum so immediately postpartum to do this. Remarkably, Kate not only did it with her firstborn, but then again with Charlotte and Louis.While a lot was obviously made of her changing style and the subtle nods to Diana , another change was playing out before our eyes. If you look back at Kateon the famous Lindo Wing steps with each of her babies, other dferences in how she handled the publicity become more apparent too. Prince George With so many new royal babies having made their debut - or about to - Georgeaposs birth on  July seems like a letime ago. Just a day after his birth, the new parents faced the press and the public outside the Lindo Wing.  The couple had delayed announcing the birth for four hours as theyaposd wanted to just enjoy spending some time with their tiny son first. When they eventually tottered outside, they were very generous with their time in the front of the cameras. Out of all of their children, William and Kate spent the longest posing for photos with George. As for why, there are a number of potential reasons.  It was a warm summer evening. George will be king one day, meaning public interest was particularly high. And, as elated, emotional, first-timers, they may have felt more inclined to show their baby off. Dressed in a polkadot Jenny Packham number, Kate did not try to hide her postpartum tummy. She paired the dress with some casual cork wedges and wore her hair in a natural, loose style.There were some signs of nerves from the new parents .Kate kept a firm hold on George, cradling him with both arms during their appearance. Only once did she release one hand to wave for photos.  Onlookers also witness a sweet and slightly fumbling handover as Kate passed George to William - and then there was the struggle fitting the car seat, which any parent can relate to. Kateaposs body language also gave away her nerves.Kateaposs feet are nearly overlapping as sheaposs standing on the stairs, body language expert Patti Wood told Good Housekeeping .This indicates that she feels the need to keep it all together. Both of them have relaxed hands but thereaposs slight gestures like the feet and forced smiles that indicate theyaposre a bit tense in this moment.    And who could blame them  Princess Charlotte Just under two years later and William and Kate are no longer first-time parents working through all the nerves and novelty of having a newborn. Kate was admitted to hospital in the early hours of the morning on May , and left later that evening.    The couple once again posed for photos but there was a marked dference from the photocall with George. Not only did Kate seem a lot more polished and preened , but she seemed a lot more confident too.    This tender moment between Will and Kate is something out of a movie, Wood said. Her fingers are locked inside his, which is her subtle way of saying aposthis moment is all about us.apos  This time, she and William spent less than two minutes in front of the camera. There was no answering questions of walkabout as there had been with George, and Kate kept hold of Charlotte the whole time - albeit cradling her with just one arm. They both appeared more poised and comfortable - and a little more businesslike.    William, this time, bossed fitting the car seat - and he even flashed a cheeky peace sign at the waiting paps. Prince Louis By the time baby Louis arrived, the Cambridges were seasoned pros at parenting - and their appearance outside the Lindo Wing proved it. There was a smaller crowd gathered outside this time - perhaps because the little prince falls slightly further down the royal ranking.  Kate was ready to face the cameras just seven hours after giving birth, and looked even more cofed, once again wearing Jenny Packham and in high heels. Perhaps mindful of the cool wind and their two eldest waiting for them at home, she and William spent just a minute and a half outside. One particularly touching shot of Kate and her new son shows them mirroring eachothersapos hand gestures.    Sure, Kate is fixing her hair from the wind but itaposs also an indicator of a strong rapport between the two, Susan Constantine, human behavioral expert and author tells Good Housekeeping. After some brief posing, the couple marched over to their car - completely confident and in sync.

The St Cuthbert’s Centre in west London provides a fine-dining experience for rough sleepers and other vulnerable members of the community five days a week.Those who attend are left amazed at the standard of the food with many left saying aposthereaposs nowhere  like itapos and apositaposs one of the best places Iaposve ever eatenapos. The open door service, known as Refettorio Felix and under the umbrella of non-profit organisation Food for Soul, is run by an amazing team of dedicated staff and volunteers. They cook up a delicious menu which changes every day and caters for inidual dietary requirements. Once a week, the centre has a aposguest chef takeoverapos - with famous names coming to prepare the food. A team from Heston Blumenthalaposs three Michelin star restaurant The Fat Duck are regulars who take control of the kitchen.  Brett Graham, head chef of the two Michelin star restaurant The Ledbury also pays a visit once every four weeks to cook up a special feast. Other well-known names who have offered their time and expertise are Executive Chef of the Ritz John Williams, who has cooked at the centre with his team, chefs from Harrods, and Jason Atherton who co-hosted the Sky Living TV series My Kitchen Rules in . And just like the regular staff at the centre, the top chefs have no idea what they will make until a van delivers fresh ingredients first thing in the morning, donated on a daily basis from a range of charities, supermarkets and restaurants working to minimise wasting surplus food. Most of the ingredients come from The Felix Project, which collects surplus food from food retailers and wholesalers and then redistributes it to charities and schools that provide food for those in need. But others are donated from Michelin star and popular restaurants, with everything on site made from scratch.  The Ledburyaposs Brett Graham said chefs are in a fortunate position to help charities.  He said: These people need a bit of nourishment, a lot of people are down on their luck. Itaposs about making a place where they feel normal. Some of the people who attend donapost have anyone to help them, no family or support. I want that place to feel special. I want people who use the service to feel like itaposs a treat and to feel like they are going to a restaurant. I enjoy cooking there and being part of it. I felt quite emotional on my first time there two years ago. Mr Graham helps out once a month but praised the work the regular staff do on a daily basis as aposfantasticapos saying: The chefs do a great job there every day and the volunteers are amazing.  About  per cent of people who turn up to St Cuthbertaposs are rough sleepers. The rest who attend are made up of the elderly, adults with learning dficulties and people with mental health conditions who live in the community but need help with caring for themselves. One woman who attends the centre, Rene, said: This is one of the best places I have eaten - I really appreciate their efforts. Russell, , has been homeless since , eating at dferent centres or waiting outside takeaways for them to throw out leftovers. He said nowhere  compares to the food at St Cuthbertaposs.  Thereaposs nothing I know of thataposs close to it for food, Russell said. Itaposs nice to be able to come and eat here and thereaposs far more people who would comethey knew about it than this place can even accomodate.  I heard about it through word of mouth - and this is what I found, he said. And he said the fine-dining experience was far from anywhere  heaposd been.    Russell said: I used to go to a day centre where everyone, like me, was homeless. But people would arrive there staggering drunk and it was the kind of place I didnapost want to be, so I had to stop. One of the problems I had to solve is, where do I get food  I regularly go to a carry out place when it closes at pm for leftovers. But anytime you find somewhere like that you have to be careful because before you know it thereaposll be others standing around doing the same. People say apossave for a rainy day,apos but what do you doevery day is a rainy day   Russell, who sleeps rough, said heaposd been in low paid jobs his whole le until he found himself out of employment and on the streets, with no savings.  I realised the alternative was ending my le or trying this le of being homeless, he said.  I donapost go to shelters because the people there are drug addicts or gamblers, they take peopleaposs things.  There are rules and regulations of shelters but I like my freedom.  If I can find a safe, quiet place to sleep, I would rather not get someone aposs permission. One man, who has been homeless for  years and did not want to be named, said: We get free food here and nice chefs who are kind. I can sit down calmly and have my food served to me. Here is a list of some of the guest chefs who have visited the charity: * Fat Duck group chefs Edward Cooke,Tom Allen, Jonny Glass and Daniel Svensson * Brett Graham, head chef of the two Michelin star restaurant The Ledbury * Executive Chef of the Ritz, John Williams * Greg Marchand, whose restaurant Frenchie Rue du Nil in Paris has been awarded a Michelin star * Sally Abé who is the head chef at Michelin-starred The Harwood Arms in London * Michelin-star chef Merlin Labron-Johnson * Chefs from Harrods * Jason Atherton who co-hosted the Sky Living TV series My Kitchen Rules in .   Jean Usher, , lives nearby and the centre enables her to have company and make great friends. We have lots of celebrity chefs here. We get a chef from the Ritz and Brett Graham from The Ledbury. Itaposs a great place to be, I wouldnapost want to be anywhere . Where would I go  I would be sitting in my one-bed flat feeling sorry for myself. Here we get a dferent menu every day. Fidela Orthega says she was once homeless for three weeks so she can relate to many people at the centre. A regular at St Cuthbertaposs for nine years, she said she is diabetic but her needs are catered for. Fidela, , said: This place is a home away from home. Steve, , added: I have got an awful lot of problems. I donapost like being on my own. Here I get my tea and a lovely lunch.  Examples of dishes Brett Graham has rustled up at the centre include veal T bones, pumpkin soup with ginger, chilli, turmeric, yoghurt and coriander and a iety of freshly made ice cream. This month chefs from The Fat Duck and Dinner by Heston attended the centre and the menu entailed a roasted vegetable salad with hummus and a pesto dressing to start, a choice of two curries for the main and a sticky toffee pudding to finish off. An example of a meal cooked by the centreaposs regular staff is a Morrocan-style white bean stew with pumkin and sesame with a pineapple carpaccio dessert.  The St Cuthbert’s Centre is a charity set up  years ago, but the Chief Executive said it was what you would expect a drop in centre to look like. It was around two years ago that the concept changed. They gets referrals from shelters and hospitals - but people mainly turn up after hearing about it through word of mouth. Chief Executive of St Cuthbertaposs Centre Ali Kingsley says: A lot of people helped by the centre are at crisis point, they are sleeping on the streets.  Itaposs all about giving them back their dignity, until they feel valued and that they are in a special place. He said for many who come to the centre, the three-course meal has to sustain them for  hours until they come back the next day. * Veal T bones * Pumpkin soup with ginger, chilli, turmeric, yoghurt and coriander * Morrocan-style white bean stew with pumkin and sesame * Moroccan-style chicken with spiced carrots, potatoes, leeks and cabbage * Hot smoked salmon fish pie with broccoli and green beans * Broccoli, caullower and courgette gratin with potatoes * Roasted vegetable salad with a hummus and a pesto dressing* Roast carrot and fennel soup with sunflower seeds * Sticky toffee pudding * Pineapple carpaccio with mint, sugar and a chocolate slice * Apple strudel * A iety of freshly made ice cream.   Two mental health support staff work at the centre - one a counsellor and the other a nutritional psychologist - and they can refer people to other services.Practical advice is offered to people on Universal Credit , and homeless people are helped with filling in forms and getting appointments with a doctor in some cases.The seating - long tables set out in the hall - is laid out to promote social interaction, a key element to what the centre does. About  people are fed the lunch each day, many are regulars but new faces are seen daily as well. Two staff chefs and four volunteer assistants make the food every day, when St Cuthbertaposs is not apostaken overapos by celebs. The centre also offers clubs for activities such as knitting and art. A barber comes in once a week to offer haircuts, clothes can be washed on site, and showers are available. Melissa, a volunteer, said she works at St Cuthbertaposs because, like many others who are involved in the initiative, I feel I want to give something back to the community.

We are driving forward a change that is urgently needed because one in eight children and young people have a mental health problem at any one time - thataposs . million in England alone.    Before an unveiling ceremony, the duchess told the invited guests: We are all here today because we care so much about transforming the mental health of children, young people and their families. I have learnt so much about early childhood development and the importance of support for parents through your work here at the Anna Freud Centre - this is something I really do care about. The ambition for the new Kantor Centre of Excellence is hugely inspiring.

Andy and Magnus Tait spent six years planning their journey visiting streets, villages and towns with naughty titles. They stopped off at Cumwhinton, Fanny Street, Upperthong, Butthole Lane, Willey, Titty Ho and Sandyballs. They also visited Bellenden Gardens, Poundbottom, Cockermouth, Penistone, Butthole Bell End, The Knob, Lower Swell, Old Sodbury, Butcombe and Shaftesbury.    The pair also took in Shitterton, Lickfold, Fingringhoe, Slutshole Lane, Feltwell, Fanny Hands Lane, Scunthorpe, Rimswell and Wetwang. The lads spent four days on their road trip and took a selfie at  roads, town or village signs. Their remarkable tour of Britain saw them trek through at least  counties on each of the north, east, south and west coasts. The trip took six years for -year-old Andy, from Aberdeen, to meticulously map out.  He dreamed up the idea after he drove past a place called South Gash, in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire in  with his brother Magnus, , from Edinburgh. Andy says he couldn’t help but laugh at the signpost and ever since that day has researched the location of other amed places. He then went on to painstakingly map out a route, incorporating  stops in almost every corner of Britain. “I always enjoy going out of my way to have fun and to take things too far”, said audio engineer Andy.  “It was a lot of fun and we actually saw a lot of interesting places, he continued. “It was a bit of a slog towards the end and it was dark when we got to some places. But never at any point did we get bored. “I’d say it’s definitely an alternative was to see Britain. We just found it hilarious. We laughed our asses off at each place and that says a lot about us.” Andy and software developer Magnus set off on their journey from Bellenden Gardens, in Edinburgh, last Friday morning. They arrived back in the same street at .am yesterday morning.    He says it took him six years to convince his brother to join him on the trip after constant pestering ever since the pair passed South Gash together in . Andy chipped away at planning his route on a monthly basis over the six years, before finally packing up a few belongings, snacks for the road and wads of cash for fuel. He says the trip saw they visit some of the country’s prettiest places. The most picturesque places for him were Poundbottom and Sandyballs in the New Forest.  But his favourite out of the whole lot based on the hilarity of its name was Wilsford Cum Lake. Andy said: “I’ve had the idea for six years now. I insisted we stopped at South Gash to take a photo but Magnus didn’t fancy it. “That led to an obsession for places with funny names and six years later Magnus decided to make it up to me. “He saw the funny side of it eventually.”  Andy’s route is so well mapped out that it only took the pair between  and  minutes to drive between each stop. He said: “We went right down the west coast, along the south coast and up the east coast of England. “We have got a childish and immature sense of humour. “This is something we can tick off our bucket list.” "},{"url":null,"title":"slimming worlds greatest loser 2019","story":"NewsSlimming Worlds Greatest Loser who was size XXXXXXXL sheds incredible  STONEJon Vidler is now looking for love after he lost a vast amount of weight - and is planning on climbing Mount SnowdonShareCommentsByLaura Connor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsAt his heaviest Jon Vidler couldn’t stand for more than a few minutes without suffering from back pain \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAt st lb and size XXXXXXXL, Jon Vidler’s hopes of being a winner in love were slender – but not now after becoming Slimming World’s Greatest Loser .

The -year-old died in  while studying at the University of Bristol - where  students have taken their own le in the last three years. An English undergraduate, he had been told the university had chosen to dismiss him from his course following his lack of attendance at lectures and at an exam.But at an inquest into his death at Avon Coroneraposs Court his parents James and Janet Murray said they feel that the university failed their son.James, from London, told the inquest that  dferent members of staff were involved in email correspondence during Benaposs seven months at Bristol University. But he said not one face-to-face meeting was organised with Ben. The student then became confused and upset about the universityaposs decision to dismiss him from his course, it was said.  Benaposs father James told how he saw Ben for lunch the same day that his son died - just hours before Benaposs death. He said: He mentioned that Bristol Uni had written to him to say thathe didnapost engage they might remove him from the university. We discussed this, and I said thathe didnapost want to continue with university that was okay. But I told him to try and pass his exam so that he could have the summer to decide whether he wanted to leave on his own terms. After lunch I hugged him and told him I loved him, and he went back to his halls - or at least, that was what he told me. James added: I feel like that last lunch I walked into a perfect storm - not knowing that he had been kicked out already, and was being forced out his accommodation, his home, the following week. In a statement to the hearing, Benaposs parents said: As a family we believe time was a critical factor in Benaposs death. He spent far too long aposstruggling in the waterapos, so to speak. Much earlier intervention was needed and should have happened. Ben was not even referred to the university halls welfare officer, as he was not considered at risk. But in the workplace, you do not just send letters to sack people. There are proper, face-to-face procedures that should be followed. For a -year-old fresher to be kicked out of his first year course without a face-to-face meeting is unacceptable and extraordinary. If a -year-old says he is anxious, and is not attending lectures, you should immediately take action, and not just send him links. What further signs do you need that something is wrong  We believe Bristol Uni failed on a number of occasions with the lack of pastoral care given to Ben. Benaposs social media messages to his university friends had suggested he was suffering from depression and they urged him to speak to student services. He had twice told senior tutor Charles Gunter that he was not feeling well, and had been struggling to connect, an inquest heard.  But although Mr Gunter emailed Ben information on how to register with student services, no checks were made on whether Ben actually did so. The inquest heard that Ben was sent a letter dated February , informing him that he was being dismissed from his course due to lack of engagement. This followed senior tutor Charles holding a telephone meeting with Ben on December , during which Ben expressed he was struggling to settle in at uni and struggling to connect. Mr Gunter said: I told him it was quite natural to feel a little bit unsettled. I established that he hadnapost registered with the uni health services, and sent him information on that and how to register. I wanted to make sure that he was aware that there was support. After Ben missed an exam in January, Mr Gunter got back in touch with him and advised him to fill out an exam absence form, as Ben once again told him he had been unwell. Mr Gunter added: At the start of February the next teaching block started, and for the second term in a row Ben did not complete registration for that teaching block. I asked ious tutorshe was attending classes, and I received mix replies. Some said he had been to lectures, others said he had come to some of them. The situation became one that required attention. This was not just Ben missing one or two classes, or failing to hand in an assignment. He had failed to engage and had not passed  credits. At a faculty meeting at the start of February, the university Arts Faculty made the decision that Ben be dismissed from his course. However, despite Mr Gunter contacting the Humanities School education doctor, Lesel Dawson, to try and raise Benaposs attendance, the senior tutor said that the dismissal letter of February  was the last contact the English School had with Ben. He said: I had hoped that Benaposs issue was just an issue with settling in in the first term. I escalated Benaposs case to Dr Dawson because I felt I had already made contact and had done what I could. I find that sometimesa student no longer wants to engage with one member of staff, perhaps talking to a new member of staff can help. However, Dr Dawson proposed a meeting with Ben on March  - two days after Benaposs appeal period to remain at the university would have passed, the inquest heard. And, the very day before his death, Benaposs friend Stefan Lossev said Ben messaged him, concerned and confused about an email informing him he had to move out of his halls the following week. Ben wrote to Stefan: I feel like Iaposm leaving the Matrix or unplugging, to which Stefan replied: Donapost kill yourself, please. The inquest heard that Ben had been known to take recreational drugs - and it was believed to be this that had contributed to his poor attendance at university lectures. Ben had started at University of Bristol in September  - but Bristol was not his first choice of uni, the inquest heard. He had hoped to go to Edinburgh University with his long-term girlfriend - and his mother Janet said that the long distance relationship was quite hard for both of them. Benaposs mum said: Ben was in a transition year. He was in his first year, having come through clearing, and so was under academic pressure. He was also facing bereavement, having lost both his grandparents to cancer  months before his own death. They were very important in Benaposs le, and he would definitely have felt that loss. I suggested that he see a counsellor to talk about his feelings around that, but he didnapost want to. Ben was in good health and was not on any medication that I was aware of. When he ed to the university after his first-year Christmas holidays, he said he was going to eat more of a plant-based diet, and be more conscious about the food he ate. He didnapost mention that he was unhappy at Bristol or not attending lectures. The inquest continues.

Chloe Storer, , was taking a picture of her -month-old son Jake when she spotted the right side of his face appeared to be paralysed. The worried mum was concerned Jake had suffered some kind of stroke and showed medics the picture during a hospital appointment.Jake had been to ious hospital appointments since birth after he stopped growing at  weeks and had to be delivered over a month early.He was eventually diagnosed with micro duplication q. - a condition so rare that only  people are diagnosed worldwide.Jakeaposs disorder can cause facial paralysis and it could even leave him with learning dficulties , heart conditions and hearing loss.   The mum-of-one, said: It becomes more obvious when he smiles or eats, and initially he had problems with his eye. I hadnapost noticed his face appeared to be drooping on the one side until I was taking a photograph of him. Theyaposre not sure why his face is paralysed, and whether itaposs linked but because the condition is so rare, weaposre still learning about it. Initially I didnapost notice but it becomes more obvious when he smiles or when he cries. With hindsight, Jake was premature and he was five weeks early. Heaposd stopped growing at  weeks and there had been no explanation for that from the doctors. They made the decision to induce early, and they began testing on him straight away - theyaposd assumed heaposd had a stroke initially but there was more to it.    When they first told me his diagnosis, it sounded like a jumble of letters, and I felt very much out of my depth - after all only  people have it worldwide. As far as we know, Jakeaposs future is completely unknown - the doctors predict things like learning dficulties, heart conditions and hearing loss, Iaposm hopeful it wonapost affect him too much, but Iaposm still learning all the time. Right now, I notice that Jake stands out because heaposs very small and he has delayed milestones. He only started walking this week, and he couldnapost roll or sit up at the normal times. He sometimes struggles eating, and when he smiles, I notice his face, itaposs almost like it could be a facial nerve. Chloe has since decided to begin her own support group in the hope of finding other aposchromo cutiesapos after struggling to find any mum and baby groups she could join. She plans to find other parents and caters for those who have children with rare chromosomes disorders.    Chloe added: Jake initially couldnapost close his right eye and I donapost think he can feel much as he sticks his finger in his eye. The most help Iaposve had has been through the charity UNIQUE who can answer some of my questions, and provide information and leaflets. But I want Jake to find someone like him - most groups are five years and over, and I just wanted to find someone in my situation. It would be a leline - there would be someone to empathise rather than sympathise. Sometimes I struggle with it, and what the future may hold for Jake, but when I see him hit milestones that we didnapost expect, like when he started walking last week, it hits home.

Barry Briggs, from Ohio, fell ill after a boating trip in Tampa, Florida and ended up with horric injuries.He raised awareness of his illness through Facebook , posting raw images of what the flesh-eating bacteria can do - leaving his foot and shin without any skin. Barry was rushed into Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton after ing home where he then spent  days undergoing extensive treatment for the terrying condition.He underwent skin grafts and was put on several dferent antibiotics, but eventually he was lucky that doctors were able to save his foot.    Barry was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis caused by group a Streptococcus bacteria which usually enters through a small wound. Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare infection and there are  to  cases in the U.S. annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Mike Walton said he was poked by a fishing hook  miles off the coast of Palm Harbor.  I had like little blisters starting to form on my hand and you could watch like sweat beads coming up on side of the hand, and then they just turned black, he said. Doctors told Mike he’s lucky to be alive, and lucky to have his arm. “When you look down and you can see your own tendons, back of your hand and your bone going up your arm,” Mike said, “that makes it real.” Walton is now recovering at home and will have to be treated with antibiotics for the next month.

He clambered on to an external air conditioner unit as the inferno ravaged his familyaposs flat in Russia. The petried child, named Denis, was heard pleading in anguish mama help me - but she was not at home. A resident of the block, who witnessed the drama, said: “His screams broke my heart.” The youngster was home alone after school in Samara city when the flames tore through his eight floor apartment. Unable to let himself out of the flat’s outer door, and choking from smoke, he climbed onto one of two air conditioner units, the one furthest from the flames.    A hair-raising video shows Denis crouching on top of the air conditioner - and at one point precariously peering down the the ground below. He held tightly to the window frame, but had also undergone training as a young climber - which may have saved his le. A worried eyewitness called Anastasia said: “The boy was home alone.  “The fire was very strong, flames were coming outside from the balcony. “The kid had nothing  to do but climb out of the window and crouch on the air conditioner. “We feared that the air conditioner would break off and fall.”  Luckily the unit stayed put and a firefighter eventually got into his flat and plucked the child to safety. Earlier rescuers had tried to raise a ladder to the boy but it got stuck in trees next to the block. After being alerted to the fire, the boy’s father had rushed home and let fireman into the flat. Anastasia said: “His parents arrived at the same time as the firefighters. “Thank God, the child is okay, just very scared. “He is now in the ambulance wrapped in a blanket having tea.” The boy was taken to hospital for serious smoke inhalatinon. The firefighter who rescued him, Evgeny Gulyaikin, said: “We were in breathing apparatus because the apartment was heavy in smoke.  “We entered the big room, where the sofa was already burning. “I and my partner rushed to the bedroom where the boy was outside the window. “He saw us, I grabbed him tightly. “I was so afraid to drop him - the height was eight floors. “I brought him in through there window. “I immediately took him out of the apartment block and handed him to medics. “The boy, of course, was in shock. And for us it was very worrying.” The boy’s parents had been at work when the fire ignited, said reports. An investigation into the cause is underway. Some  firefighters were involved in extinguishing the fire, with  residents needing to be evacuated.

-minute rail journey from to a London Zone  station and designated as London according to IATA city code”.It means flights to London from Dundee could potentially switch from Stansted to airports such as Luton or Southend, should the winning bidder chose to redirect the route.Tenders for consideration need to be submitted by June .The invitation for airlines to provide a twice-daily connection between Dundee and London comes only a month after the Tele revealed that air links between the two cities could be set for a shake-up, after it emerged funding for the current Stansted route is only to be available until later this year.The local authority has pledged £, to support the route as part of a public service obligationpackage agreed between itself, the Department for Transport, Transport Scotland and route operator Loganair.It also comes a week after Loganair announced it would not be introducing its new fleet of planes to the Dundee to Stansted route.Alison Henderson, chief executive of Dundee and Angus Chamber of Commerce, said the invitation for the tenders was a sign that there was a commitment to the Dundee-London route.Ms Henderson said: “This is an important route for tourism and business, linking Dundee not only with London but hopefully with an airport that connects to other airports outwith the UK.“Ideally we would like to see flights from Dundee to an airport that provides a central onward hub where out of the UK.“Air travel is hugely important both for business and tourism in Dundee.“Dundee businesses are very keen to see regular flights to London and would welcome flights to an airport hub.“We are hoping for the right flights, to the right locations at the right price to be put in place as quickly as possible.”Dundee City Council and airport

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"strathlachlan cup attracts players from all over argyll","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe annual Strathlachlan Cup Open Pairs indoor bowling competition took place on Saturday February  at Strachur Memorial Hall.There was a good turnout of  pairs with members from Cairnbaan, Colintraive, Connel, Innellan, Inveraray, Kilmun as well as the host club  Strathlachlan.There were some close games in the qualying rounds and the lucky four pairs to reach the semi-finals were Tom Paton and Moira Robertson, Strathlachlan Myra Campbell and Duncan Lauder, Innellan Fulton Ronald, Connel, and Robert Scott, Cairnbaan, and John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs Senior, Strathlachlan.The finalists were Strathlachlan#s John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs v Fulton Ronald and Robert Scott, with the visiting team going into the last end one shot up.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

This mast should provide an lsquoemergency servicersquo for all the local residents and businesses should our land lines fail, as they frequently do.ldquoThere have been many occasions when accidents have happened with no means of getting help.ldquoThis will also be a great asset to tourists and traffic passing through our valley.The local branch of the National Farmers Union, which counts  members, has also thrown its weight behind the proposals.In a support letter, Selkirk branch secretary Rory Murray writes: ldquoIt is vital that in todayrsquos connected world, basic services now include the provision of a reliable mobile network, and not just for the obvious benefits to rural safety, should people be stranded without signal.ldquoA solid G signal will transform many agricultural-based businessrsquo ability to complete basic tasks that are now exclusively online, as the time constraints poor mobile phone signal and broadband signal places on rural businesses is a very real worry for our members.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council has received nine letters of objection to the plans, with objectors citing the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.Mr Brian Russell, of Selkirk, writes in his objection letter: ldquoThat the Ettrick valley must have mobile masts is disappointing to those of us who came here to escape such things.ldquoOf course escape is now becoming impossible anywhere on this island, but at the very least we had hoped to be allowed to live far enough away from a base station not to be adversely affected.ldquoHealth concerns for masts and cell phones are largely discounted now, but itrsquos as well to remember that the questionable safety of very profitable technologies may not come out for decades after their introduction, e.g. in the s and s there was widespread use of agrochemicals. I was a farmer at that time and was told they were perfectly safe. Many of the chemicals we were using then have now been banned as unsafe for one reason or another.ldquoI fear the same sort of thing will happen with mobile technologies, the overuse of which masts like this one will encourage ndash technologies which are described as essential but are more often than not simply recreational or convenient.In a submission to council planners, the developers have tried to address some of the issues raised by the objectors.Damian Hosker, the principal planner at WHP Telecoms, writes: ldquoG connectivity enables iniduals and businesses to work and ecommerce effectively from home.ldquoThis means that car travel can be reduced which has a positive effect on the environment.ldquoMobile connectivity creates a sustainable community and promotes environmental issues.ldquoThe proposal is set against the backdrop of the forest.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly. Unfortunately for Rae, it was the wrong story ndash true, but wrong in that it was not the story that Victorian England wanted.Unspotted Snow is a play of two halves: the first set on the barren ice flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing Room, where John Rae again finds himself telling a story that his audience simply cannot, or will not, understand.Unspotted Snow will be performed at the MacArts in Galashiels on Thursday, May  and

have electricity and water shortages and to fetch and carry drinking water.ldquoFor the two years I went without washing machines, showers, fridges, cookers, TV or a flushing toilet.His desire to experience the tough reality of le in these societies is perhaps unsurprising given his previous holiday destinations have included North Korea, Chernobyl and the annexed Crimean Peninsula.Despite the dficulties faced by the communities he assisted, Dominic was struck by the gratitude and positivity he encountered. He said: ldquoThe best part was seeing the smiles and laughs of the people I helped.ldquoThey were grateful and happy, and because I lived like the majority of the people in the slum they made feel a part of the community - I really did feel like it was home.This sense of community was demonstrated when a newly born child was named after him, an experience which left Dominic ldquospeechless and overwhelmed.The experiences of his spartan existence during his charitable travels, and the positivity of communities with so few of the things we take for granted, have shaped Dominicrsquos attitude

Valley.Warrington-based WHP Telecoms plans on erecting a  metre-high G tower on Deephope Hill, just off the B between Eskdalemuir and Ettrick.The plans have largely been welcomed by local residents, who cite the current lack of mobile phone signal as a detriment to both the quality of le in the valley and the ability of businesses to thrive.However, they also attracted nine letters of objection, which cited concerns over the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.One supporter, Ogilvie Jackson, of Selkirk, appeared before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday to urge councillors to support the plans.He told the committee: ldquoWe have been lobbying very hard to get mobile coverage in the valley.ldquoFor the last three years our neighbours at Ettrick village have enjoyed good coverage due to government funded masts that tower over the settlement.ldquoThe mast before you will give us near perfect G coverage for the Ettrick Valley.ldquoThe proposed site could not be better. In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks. This will avoid the need for a proleration of other masts locally.ldquoThe proposed development complies with the principal policy requirements of the local development plan and is consistent with ensuring that an improved digital infrastructure is available, to ensure people and communities are better connected.While discussing the proposals, councillors were broadly in favour of granting planning permission.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: ldquoI have no problem with this application whatsoever.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun.

The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it. There is enough connection to our national hero in East Lothian to say our landscape can also claim connection to him.I will search deeper for references to Wallacersquos Mutton Hole at Yellow Craig andmy findings to this pagemy search proves fruitful. But regardless of the results of this search, for me Yellow Craig will always be a place of magic contemplation and imaginative possibilities."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-golf-scorecard-from-musselburgh-up-for-auction","story":"Estimated at pound,-,, the card, which has been framed and mounted, dates from December , .It shows that a Mr Cundell played the five holes within the Musselburgh race track twice, a total of  holes in  strokes.

It recommended the introduction of six tests to guide that transition, one of which is the financial requirements of Scottish residents and businesses.ldquoThose tests were back by SNP conference on Saturday. Our position is clear. Until a new currency can be safely and established in the interests of the whole economy, the currency of an independent Scotland should continue to be the pound sterling.Mr Kelly said the SNP wanted to drop the pound immediately, devaluing savings, and would make Scottish families and business ldquosignicantly worse off.Mr Mackay, who was on the Growth Commission, said he was ldquodelighted the currency resolution he co-authored was passed - after activists added ldquoas soon as practicable.He said: ldquoWe have set out, in terms of currency, the position that we continue with the pound.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service. If a bin has not been emptied and tagged explaining why it has not been emptied, it is contaminated and the offending materials must be removed before the next collection. Crews will notto empty a rejected bin until the next scheduled collection day for the same bin.Bins considered to have little or no levels of contaminants will be emptied as normal.Collection crews will keep a record of bins unemptied due to overloading or contamination and this will be checked before a decision is made toto empty any bin reported as a missed collection.For those with a lot of recyclable materials, additional, free recycling bins can be requested by contacting the council’s Wasteline. Additional non-recyclable waste bins may also be authorised where there is a genuine need following a home visit and assessment by a Community Waste Officer. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland\"  Police urge revellers to be safe and responsible viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"The council’s Head of Roads, Waste and Landscape services, Philip McKay, said: “It’s important residents understand how to recycle properly and make best use of the facilities available to them. “Sending waste to landfill costs more than double the amount it costs to recycle and tackling the levels of contamination in kerbside bins is intended to reduce the amount of recyclates sent to landfill.“We will be enforcing the procedures in a staggered rollout, tackling problem routes first. This will allow crews to get used to the new procedures without any severe implications for the collection schedule.”Over half the materials in local non-recyclable waste bins are recyclable through existing services – equating to around , tonnes of recyclable materials being landfilled at a cost of £.million a year.Not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other essential council services.Residents are encouraged to get in touch with the Recycling and Waste Aberdeenshire Facebook pagethey are unsure of how to dispose of any material not listed in the A-Z guide.For any recycling and waste related queries, or to request an additional recycling or non-recycling bin, please contact Wasteline."},{"url":null,"title":"occasional hours licence for brewdog","story":"An Aberdeenshire licensing authority has narrowly paved the way for the anticipated opening of BrewDog#s new #, Inverurie bar and restaurant next month.Despite the brewing giants not possessing a provisional licence, Aberdeenshire Central Licensing Board took the highly unusual step of granting two occasional licences to enable it to open in the former Mitchell’s Dairy premises on Market Street.Some  new staff can now be employed at the bar which will see the number of BrewDog employees in Aberdeenshire soar to more than .BrewDog retail director James Brown told the board the firm had made “a huge commitment to Inverurie and Aberdeenshire” and afterwards said he was “delighted” with the decision which will initially allow the bar to operate from May  to .The company’s full licence application is currently being fast-tracked by the council after delays incurred due to the installation of a new data system and subsequent backlog.Under the agreement after a close - vote by licensing board members, the bar has been limited to operating from am to  midnight Sunday to Thursday and from am to am Friday and Saturday but only while former BrewDog Tap Room manager Craig Cargill is on the premises. Off-sales have been approved from am to pm Monday to Sunday.However, among ious conditions imposed by the licensing standards team, it was also agreed that the outdoor space to the rear of the premises will not be utilised by customers until a full licence is granted.The licensing board heard from Audrey Junner of agents Hill Brown Licensing that BrewDog had no intention to trade by way of occasional licences for an extended period of time.She added: “We would like to reassure members that a provisional premises licence has been submitted… for the avoidance of doubt my clients wholly accept that no assumptions can be made about the grant of that provisional licence.“They have undertaken the fit-out works at the business entirely at their own risk.”But licensing standards officer Lisa Gordini reminded the board that while a provisional licence had been applied for, it would not be discussed until the board’s June meeting and could receive representations or objections which could impact on BrewDog’s operation.She maintained there was an argument that the board should not be granting any occasional licences which may “conflict with the consultation process” of the provisional licence application.After considerable debate, board member Robbie Withey proposed refusal of the application, saying the authority expected a six-month consultation period to process applications and that the company – which operates  bars around the world – should have applied sooner.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Andy Beattie will be honoured with a new road named after him at Midmill Business Park\"  Honour for football manager viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"But admitting that the application was “a dficult one”, Gwyneth Petrie proposed making an “absolute exception” to usual practice and proposed approval."},{"url":null,"title":"pitcairn dominates thainstone breeding sale","story":"A Limousin cross British Blue heer and its heer calf sold for the top price at Aberdeen and Northern Marts# annual show and sale of commercial beef breeding cattle at Thainstone, sponsored by East Coast Viners.The animals from regular consignors, Craig and Katreen Malone, Pitcairn, Lochgelly, Cardenden, Fe, sold for £,.Champion in the pre-sale show judged by Will MacDonald, Tormore, Dunbeath and Kris Sutherland, Dunbeath Farms, Dunbeath, this heer was originally bought as a bulling heer from William and David Moir of Moir Livestock, Fraserburgh, while the heer calf is by Lodge Hamlet.The outfit sold for the lead price of £ to Dunbeath Farms, Dunbeath, Caithness.Craig and Katreen also scooped the reserve champion honours with a Limousin cross heer bred by Tom Howden, Stanley Farms.

With new surfacing laid over the last week, the council say that a short time will be required for the surface to cure, with the streets to reopen to traffic on Friday at the latest.The works are part of the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative’sPlaces and Spaces project, which include changes to the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, as well as providing a new path to the War Memorial on the Kirk Green.With the initial phase of the project now completed, works will be suspended for the main summer season. Plans are for work to move to the entrance to Victoria Street in the autumn, being suspended again in December for Christmas shopping season.The Places and Spaces initiative was developed alongside community groups such as the Kirkwall and St Ola Community Council and the Kirkwall BID, who identied key areas of the town where it was felt improvements could be made. According to OIC, proposed improvements were the positively received by the Orkney community during a two-day consultation period, where  per cent of those who attended said they supported the proposals,  per cent were against and the rest were undecided.The Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative is a five-year heritage-based grant scheme which seeks to deliver sustainable improvements to the built heritage of the Kirkwall Conservation Area, in an effort to regenerate the centre of Kirkwall for the benefit of local communities and businesses, as well as to attract visitors.

The council say that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling the local authority to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon. This, OIC believes, will provide a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council hopes that developments will allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney, including future development of the marine energy sector.OIC believes that the wider economic development value of a new cable to Orkney could be highly signicant, particularlya substantial proportion of local ownership can be secured — which could help employment and income remain in the county.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The proximity of the project at Quanterness to Kirkwall could also enable a separate private wire network project in which the council could directly supply electricity to its own buildings as a means to reduce costs.Public engagement events have been organised for Kirkwall, Eday and Rendall over the coming fortnight. Proposed plans for the developments will be on display at these, with elected members and council officers on hand to discuss the plans with members of the public. The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six m blade tip height turbines. The site on Faray has enough space for up to eight m blade tip height turbinesThe event details are as follows:An event will also be held in Westray, with the date yet to be confirmed.The current proposal at the third site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines, compared to the  presented in the original plans.The proposals for each site are expected to evolve as further site investigation work and consultation is undertaken. Site investigations, including bird and telecommunications studies, will be ongoing at all three sites.The council#s intention is to reach planning permission stage by the end of , ensuring all views and issues are fully explored and considered before any final decisions are made.  Proposals for how the applications will be determined are currently being considered.Councillor James Stockan, Orkney Islands Council leader said: “It is vital that the Council now takes an active ‘developer approach’ to energy projects in our islands. Not only does this allow us to maximise the resources available to us in the islands to support services and projects for local people, but it also allows us to contribute signicantly and in a meaningful way to allow our world-renowned local energy industry to survive and thrive through a new grid connection.“Our strategy is one that meets uncertainty head-on. The final details of proposals are by no means set in stone whilst investigations are carried out at the three sites, nor are all three sites guaranteed planning permission — and of course we also wish to take into account public opinion on the developments. Widening the net and moving to investigate three separate sites, allows us a degree of flexibility in the make-up of the final outcome.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The report follows contributions from  universities and student unions and six regional roundtable evidence sessions with  attendees on how the attainment gap should be tackled.Five steps for universities to improve BAME student outcomes have been identied and include providing strong leadership and having conversations about race and cultures.The other three recommendations are developing racially erse and inclusive environments, getting the evidence and analysing the data, and working together to understand ldquowhat works.Baroness Amos said: ldquoOur universities are racially and culturally erse, compared to many other sectors, but we are failing a generation of studentswe donrsquot act now to reduce the BAME attainment gap.ldquoWhile many universities are proactive on the issue, this report and its recommendations aims to deliver transformation in our sector.ldquoIt is important that universities act and are transparent in their approach so black, Asian and minority ethnic students are given the best chance of success.

This is a curious thing, as the proportion of people who actually have a boat is quite small. And yet there is research somewhere – or,there isn’t there should be – that shows that just about everyone at some time or another thinks “Wouldn’t it be nice to have a boat ” In many cases that is as far as it goes in others, the thought becomes a reality and le as they knew it changes forever. That is the essential revelation of boat ownership: nothing is ever the same.Of course, many people do not realise that having a boat is well within their means. Boats can obviously be extremely expensive: a good number of the sleek yachts to be seen in the cruising grounds of the Caribbean and the Mediterranean will not be the fruits of honest labour, but are the status symbols of hedge-fund managers and the like. These boats usually bring unhappiness, in a contemporary Faustian sense, perhaps, as the owners of super yachts will always be jealous of those whose yachts are bigger than theirs. They are just that sort of person. So when, from a tiny passing boat, or from the crowded  of a cheap and cheerful cruise ship, one sees these people basking on recliners on their pristine teak decks, do not imagine that they are happy. They are not.: Extraordinary le of Captain John Isbester recalled in new bookAt the other end of the spectrum – where most of us find ourselves – the urge to have a boat can be very easily satisfied. Small, knockabout boats are not at all expensive, especiallyacquired second-hand. A rowing boat may be bought for a few hundred pounds, as may a kayak. These are boats, and they float,put in the water the right way up. That is something you should perhaps be certain of before you put your newly acquired boat in the water. You should also familiarise yourself with bungs. These, to use land-based language, are the corks that boats have. You will find them down at the bottom, usually at the back . Make sure the cork is in, or your boat will fill with water and sink.You should also be careful what bit of water you put your boat into. Broadly speaking, water falls into two categories: saline and non-saline. Saline water is known as the sea, and it is very dangerous in every respect. Non-saline water is to be found in rivers, lochs and canals. You can put your boat into a river, but remember that when you put a boat in a river it tends to end up in a dferent place from the place in which it was first launched.A loch is a safe bet, although a large loch can get rough in the middlethe wind blows up. As a general rule, the wind is always blowing up, especially during those months in which it is not meant to be blowing up. There are also certain places where the wind is so strong that any form of boating is not recommended. Scotland is one of those places. Greece is another, where there is a wind called the Meltemi that blows up every afternoon.People who buy boats usually have no idea where they want to go in them. As a result, most boats you see in coastal waters are not going anywhere at all, but are simply circling about before theyto the place from which they set out. These places are called marinas, and are highly profitable to the people who run them. They have shops there known as chandleries that will sell you things for your boat. These things are regularly needed as most things already on boats will fall into the sea and require to be replaced.:  of the best sailing holidays in ScotlandThe crew of boats also regularly fall into the sea and require to be replaced. To limit the need for replacement, people wear le jackets. These are now triggered by exposure to water and are self-inflating. In Scotland, where we are all exposed to water in the atmosphere, these le jackets may inflate at odd moments. These occasions can be treated as practice drills.Many delights await youyou are fortunate enough to sail on a slightly larger boat . These are equipped with galleys, where food such as cold sausages, may be prepared. They also have toilets, known as the heads, which are designed to be ecologically sensitive and therefore do not work.Calling in on a harbour in one’s boat is a very particular pleasure. Medical attention will usually be available, and thereafter one may go to a harbour pub and listen to people singing about being out at sea. The usual song is Spanish Ladies, although you will hear The Mingulay Boat Song in places like Stornaway or Ullapool. You do not need to know the words of these songs to sing them to some effect.The happiest day of your le is the day you buy your boat. An even happier day is the day you sell it. The bit in between can be full of joy, too, in its special way. Read Patrick O’Brian and find all about it.

But any prospect of the UK government repeating the granting of a Section  order, which would allow Scottish ministers to hold a legally binding vote, was ruled out by Mr Lidington.“We don’t see any evidence that there is a demand from the people of Scotland to review the decision they took in ,” he said. “That referendum was said at the time to settle matters for a generation.“We don’t see that a Section  order is called for. I don’t see how it would help put right problems with Scottish schools and hospitals.“Devolution in Scotland has given many additional powers to the Scottish Parliament and some of those powers have not even be used. So I think there is plenty more that can be done in terms of the Scottish Government using the powers that are already there.”Askedhe would rule out granting a Section  order before , the minister said: “We have made it very clear we don’t think that is justied.”The First Minister indicated the Scottish Government would hold off requesting a Section  order. While Mrs May’s administration has ruled out granting one, the Prime Minister is widely expected to stand down in the coming monthsa Brexit deal can be secured. Mr Lidington refused to speculate on whether a new Tory government would be more likely to grant the order. The minister’s remarks were seized on by the SNP, with the party’s Westminster leader describing them as an “arrogant diktat”.Ian Blackford said: “Scotland’s future cannot and will not be decided by the arrogant diktat of this shambles of a Tory government, which has been rejected by Scottish voters at every election and which is soon likely to be out of office.“Whatever people’s views on independence, a strong majority of people back the Scottish Parliament’s right to determine the nation’s future.“Overwhelmingly, it is Holyrood – not Westminster – which the people of Scotland believe should have the right to decide this country’s democratic path.“The Westminster system is broken beyond repair and does not serve Scotland’s interests – something now conceded at senior levels in the Scottish Tory ranks.” But the Scottish Conservatives said the new polling proved there was no demand for another referendum.The Survation poll found more people were in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK than leaving. Askeda referendum was held on the question “should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom ”,  per cent said they would vote remain and  per cent said they would vote leave.More respondentssaid leaving the UK would be worse for Scotland’s economy than Brexit, while  per cent thought it would be better.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!"},{"url":null,"title":"li","story":"The Liberal Democrats claimed by far the highest number of Shetland votes in Thursday#s European elections, gaining roughly twice the number of nearest rivals the SNP.However, the isles# effort was unable to save the Euro seat of Lib Dem George Lyon, who was likely to be replaced at Brussels by UKIP#s David Coburn.Returning officer Jan-Robert Riise at the European Election count.

Salmond and Farage, the opposite sides of a nasty #nationalist# coin.And what of British Nationalists Mr Tinkler For example Michael Gove yesterday, banning #Of Mice  Men# and #To Kill a Mockingbird# from school reading lists in England.Can you imagine the SNP doing likewise because the want -% of literature studied to be Scottish Inconceivable.For whatever reason British nationalism # incredibly, even in the form of UKIP # isn#t sneered at the same way as Scottish nationalism.What is your point Carl  Scotland is somehow superior to England because it does not ban “Of Mice  Men” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” from school reading lists. How very petty of you. For information I loathe all nationalism, Scottish, British what is the dference, just raw tribalism by another name.SNP, UKIP, Scottish Independence, United Kingdom Independence, as I said, two sides of a very nasty littlecoin.How verySad andironic, the Scots# inScotland have just elected a UKIP MEP!! I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example. Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead. I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak.

However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it.

I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws.

Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian.

I saw so many people cycling and scooting without helmets on.”Joshua, who has been riding his bike since the age of three, said: “I’ve always worn a helmet. It’s very important for safety, just like wearing a seatbelt when you’re in a car. It should be made into a law.”His father Michael said: “Joshua asked me how it could be made into a law. I tried to explain to him how Parliament worked and suggested that he write to the prime minister about getting a law passed. He did just that and asked her to make it illegal to cycle without a helmet.“He was overjoyed when he got a letter back from  Downing Street thanking him for his letter.”Joshua said: “I’d like to see it made law in the next two or three years.

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"yfc get on their bike with 75km for 75 years","story":"Rathfriland Young Farmers Club are set to kick off their th anniversary celebrations with a bang this weekend.The club are delighted to announce their first event to commemorate the milestone anniversary with a sponsored cycle challenge.

They’ve been to an All-Ireland semi-final and they know when to stop the game and they have a few marquee players. I thought our boys matched them. We were under the cosh at times, but our boys showed desire and pride too. The conditions were dficult and we saw some of the shots and passes out there – the game was probably lucky to be played, but the surface was fine.”The teams were closely matched for the first  minutes with Antrim’s Paudie McLaughlin cancelling out an early Liam McDonald free for Monaghan.However, the hosts were dealt a blow when full-back Emmett Irvine, who had impressed in the early stages, picked up a black card after  minutes and the Farneymen assumed control for the remainder of the half with scores from Jason Irwin, Darragh Dempseyand McDonaldputting them - to - ahead at the break.Antrim’s second and final point arrived via a well-taken effort from Daniel McNicholl while Irwin landed his second of the evening on  minutes.Yet, the Monaghan captain, booked in the first half, picked up a second yellow for a high tackle moments later and the visitors were guilty of some cynical fouling as they looked to preserve their lead.Another Dempsey free moved them four clear inside the final  minutes and they looked to have done enough to seal victory.Antrim’s Ryan Lennon was black-carded for a third-man tackle, but a clever pass across the face of goal in stoppage time from Reuben Carleton allowed McNally to palm the ball past Joe Kirk in the Monaghan goal.Monaghan corner-forward McDonald was issued with a straight red for a strike while Antrim didn’t have time to muster a late equaliser.McAllister’s men must quickly regroup for the Qualiers as they will face Armagh in the Athletic Grounds on Saturday afternoon.ANTRIM: J Rodgers R Carleton, E Irvine, M Ferris R Hagan, E Higgins, S O’Callaghan J McNally -, D McNicholl - R McKillop, S Madden, C Higgins P McLaughlin -, R Lennon, R Boyle.Subs: C Killough for Irvine , M Lynch for Higgins .

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in.

But the Court of Appeal ruled today that was the wrong outcome, and remitted the case back to another judge to consider a fresh hearing.Mr Devine, who operates Devines Chauffeur Services out of the Republic of Ireland, picked up the undisclosed band member at the Culloden Hotel on the outskirts of Belfast.Promoters of the One Direction concert had instructed him to take the VIP passenger to the performers entrance at the SSE Arena.Driver and Vehicle Agencyexaminers investigating a complaint about an allegedly unlicensed taxi spoke to him after he made the drop-off at the venue.Under caution Mr Devine stated that his Mercedes Viano was booked as a continuous service which originated and was to terminate in the south of Ireland, the court heard.He confirmed that he did not have a Northern Ireland Public Service Vehicleor taxi drivers licence, but had all the necessary accreditation in the Republic.Mr Devine was subsequently summonsed for alleged offences of driving and operating a taxi service without the necessary permits.During the original proceedings his lawyers requested full details on any surveillance or monitoring carried out on him.They claimed department officials had been watching Mr Devine on the night in question following a complaint.The Public Prosecution Service resisted disclosure, asserting public interest immunityon the intelligence document containing information passed to the DVA.Appeal judges were asked to consider the case following decisions to refuse the PII application and to stay proceedings against Mr Devine.They concluded that both determinations had been incorrect.Lord Justice Treacy confirmed: \"We are remitting the case to Belfast Magistrates Court to be heard by another district judge.\"Following the ruling, Mr Devines solicitor, Denis Moloney, expressed his hope that the prosecution will ultimately be dropped.He said: \"Mr clear instructions from Mr Devine is that he was making a continuous journey in the one direction.\""},{"url":null,"title":"dr paisley would be aghast dups gay candidate a betrayal says jim wells","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In the late s then leader Mr Paisley led a Save Ulster from Sodomy campaign in an attempt to prevent the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland.Mr Wells has attracted criticism for his comments in the past, most recently banning two DUP colleagues from his social media for voting in favour of LGBT issues.The former Health Minister alleged that Ms Bennington had been selected to run by party officers over more qualied local candidates. data-dfpadtargetingJim WellsRead MoreDUP fields first openly gay council candidateWells bars DUP pair from his social media sites over LGBT voteJim Wells expresses grave concern over introduction of HIV preventative drug in Northern Ireland\"Nobody in the party beyond headquarters staff were aware of this,\" the South Down MLA said.\"I have had calls from every corner of Northern Ireland and further afield, from Londonderry, Kilkeel, Ballymena, Tyrone, all absolutely shocked on so many levels.\"\"There was absolutely no consultation with anybody at any level.

bpanews_bba-dd-e-bb-bd_EmailAn SNP MP has said he would be prepared to cast the deciding vote against Scottish independence as Commons Speaker..pushPerth MP Pete Wishart announced his bid to become the new Speaker when incumbent John Bercow steps down.The current Speaker had to side with the Government in a historic Commons tie over indicative votes in order to break the Brexit deadlock.When the Press Association asked Mr Wishart what he would doa similar deadlock were ever to happen in the Commons on Scottish independence, he admitted he would have to make “unpalatable” decisions.He said: “The Speaker always has to cast the vote in favour of the status quo, regardless of how unpalatable that might be.“From personal point of view it’s not great but there are years and years of these types of conventions.“In terms of Scottish independence I can’t actually foresee a situation where we can expect Westminster to be deciding that, though.”But Mr Wishart said nobody should doubt his personal commitment to independence, as he had demonstrated during the first independence referendum.I was here in Westminster during the first independence referendum and I dont think I ever worked so hard to kick myself out of a job than during thatPete Wishart MPAcknowledging some SNP supporters had been extremely unhappy with his announcement, claiming he was not “settling up but settling in”, the Perth MP appealed for them to recognise his long history of campaigning for Scottish independence as an MP.He said: “I was here in Westminster during the first independence referendum and I don’t think I ever worked so hard to kick myself out of a job than during that.“When we have the next independence referendum I will be trying equally hard.“Some of the more enthusiastic supporters could look at who would be better in the chair than an MP who comes from the SNP.”Mr Wishart said he also understood he would not have the natural, large support base of the two main parties but hoped to attract MPs who were tired of the status quo and wanted a modernised and more equal Commons.The shadow Commons leader’s manesto includes bringing in electronic voting, which is already in place in the Scottish Parliament, and calling MPs who have campaigned on topics first instead of by seniority.The veteran MP, who also chairs the Scottish Affairs Committee, wants to end the practice of referring to MPs by their constituency, because he wants MPs to “speak to each other like ordinary human beings”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Speaker John Bercow addresses MPs during Prime Minister’s Questions And Mr Wishart said he had “total respect and admiration” for the work of his friend Mr Bercow, despite accusations of bullying.The SNP MP said: “I thinkhas transformed the whole role in the face of consistent attacks from the executive and the Government and the way he has conducted himself has been exemplary.“I hope he does stay on for his whole term.”He does not address the issue of bullying directly in his manesto, which he admits to the Press Association he should “probably have included”, and stressed his long history of working to combat bullying.A pledge to reform the management of the Commons by including staff as well as MPs, is included, as is promise to remove sanctions for clapping and push for more family-friendly working hours.Ive got no intention of retiringPete Wishart MPMr Wishart also denied he was edging towards retirement due to disappointment when he pulled out of the deputy leadership last year.“I’ve got no intention of retiring,” he said. “I’ve never really had any leadership ambition.“I sort of stumbled into being a politician from being a musician and I’ve taken forward causes that are really important to me regardless of how popular or unpopular they might be.“This is the same thing because people at home are looking at us and thinking ‘what on Earth is going on in that place ’ and we need to look at what a st-century Parliament should be.”"},{"url":null,"title":"some language in book deplorable says foreword writer corbyn","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Like too many on the Left, he did make a racist  ugly alignment of ‘Jewish finance’ with imperialism. But he was also an important figure, worthy of study, within the th century liberal tradition.— Tristram HuntMay , A Labour Party spokesman said: “Jeremy praised the Liberal Hobson’s century-old classic study of imperialism in Africa and Asia.“Similarly to other books of its era, Hobson’s work contains outdated and offensive references and observations, and Jeremy completely rejects the anti-Semitic elements of his analysis.”Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told Sky News that she had not read Hobson’s book, but added: “The guy in question was a political thinker of his time, whether you agree with his opinions or not.“Numerous Labour and Conservative colleagues have commented on him, whether that’s negatively or positively, taking certain parts of his thinking into consideration.“But in no way would the Labour Party or Jeremy Corbyn condone any anti-Semitic comments in any way.”A senior Labour source rejected suggestions that Mr Corbyn had shown a pattern of selective blindness towards anti-Semitism.Hobson’s book also contained “repugnant and racist” language about African and Asian subjects of imperial power, said the source, adding: “It’s not that he couldn’t see that, it’s that he wasn’t talking about that. He regarded it as a book of its time with the language of that era.”It was “reasonable” for Mr Corbyn to write a foreword about Hobson’s broader economic ideas without focusing on the offensive language used, said the source.“He was talking about a much broader set of issues and didn’t engage with the detail of the language, whether it applied to anti-Semitism or other forms of racism,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"indian army claims yeti discovery prompting social media mockery","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nerves of steel, calmness and sanity. Long live the workers and of the country!”On Tuesday the opposition’s hoped-for split in the military did not emerge, a plane that the United States claimed was standing by to ferry Mr Maduro into exile never took off and by nightfall one of the government’s bravest opponents, who defied house arrest to join the insurrection, had quietly sought refuge with his family in a foreign embassy.Mr Guaido, the telegenic -year-old leader of the opposition-dominated congress who is recognised by the US and over  nations as Venezuela’s rightful president, nonetheless pressed forward in calling for a new round of mass street protests. Opposition forces are hoping that Venezuelans angered by broadcast images of armoured vehicles ploughing into protesters and fed up with their nation’s dire humanitarian crisis will fill streets across the nation.In one blow to Mr Maduro, the head of Venezuela’s feared intelligence agency announced that he was breaking ranks with the embattled socialist leader.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Men look to recover usable parts from motorcycles burned during the previous day’s clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces in Caracas, Venezuela “We need to keep up the pressure,” Mr Guaido said. “We will be in the streets.”The latest chapter in Venezuela’s political upheaval marks the most serious threat yet to Mr Maduro’s contested rule. The leader, who has been relying on support from Russia and China, was largely absent as events unfolded on Tuesday. He finally emerged late in the evening to call the small-scale uprising a failed US-backed coup attempt.Speaking on state television, Mr Maduro said that the unrest had been quelled and that Venezuela would not succumb to right-wing forces intent on “submitting our country to a neocolonial economic domination model and enslaving Venezuela”.“Now you can see a Venezuela largely in peace,” he proclaimed.Venezuelans waited to seethat remained the case.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A Boliian National Guard vehicle sprays opponents of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro The competing quests to solidy a hold on power produced one of the most stunning days yet for a country with the world’s largest proven oil reserves but is struggling with an economic contraction that is worse than the US Great Depression.The turmoil on Tuesday began when Mr Guaido, flanked by a few dozen national guardsmen and some armoured crowd-control vehicles, released a three-minute video shot near the Carlota air base.In a surprise, Leopoldo Lopez, Mr Guaido’s political mentor and the nation’s most-prominent opposition activist, stood alongside him.

A smaller group of masked youths stayed behind on the road, lobbing rocks and petrol bombs toward the air base and setting a government bus on fire.“It’s now or never,” said one of the young rebellious soldiers, his face covered in the blue bandanna worn by the few dozen insurgent soldiers.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  An opponent of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro Amid the mayhem, several armoured utility vehicles drove at full speed into the crowd.

There were also reports that  soldiers who had been with Mr Guaido fled to Brazil’s diplomatic mission.Amid the unrest, Mr Maduro’s military commanders went on state television to proclaim their loyalty. Flanked by top generals, defence minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez condemned Mr Guaido’s move as a “terrorist” act and “coup attempt” that was bound to fail like past uprisings.“Those who try to take Miraflores with violence will be met with violence,” he said, referring to the presidential palace where hundreds of government supporters, some of them brandishing firearms, gathered in response to a call to defend Mr Maduro.But in a possible sign that Mr Maduro’s inner circle could be fracturing, the head of Venezuela’s secret police wrote a letter breaking ranks with the embattled leader.In a letter directed to the Venezuelan people, Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figuera, the head of Venezuela’s feared SEBIN intelligence agency, said he had always been loyal to Mr Maduro but now it is time to “rebuild the country”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Francisco Fajardo road sits empty the day after clashes occurred He said corruption has become so rampant that “many high-ranking public servants practise it like a sport”.“The hour has arrived for us to look for other ways of doing politics,” Mr Figuera wrote.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed Mr Maduro had an airplane “on the tarmac” Tuesday morning and was ready to flee but was dissuaded by “Russians”.Mr Maduro ridiculed that idea in his TV speech, adding: “Mr Pompeo, what lack of seriousness.”Most shops and businesses were closed and the streets of the capital unusually quiet as people huddled at home to await the outcome of the drama.Mr Guaido said he called for the uprising to restore a constitutional order broken when Mr Maduro was sworn in earlier this year for a second term following a presidential election boycotted by the opposition and considered illegitimate by dozens of countries.As events unfolded, governments around the world expressed support for Mr Guaido while reiterating calls to avoid violent confrontation.The majority of Venezuelans and the leading democracies in the region have called for the exit of foreign security and intelligence forces from Venezuela and reiterated the rejection of Maduro’s usurpation of power.— John BoltonMay , US national security adviser John Bolton said the Trump administration was waiting for three key officials, including Mr Maduro’s defence minister and head of the supreme court, to act on what he said were private pledges to remove Mr Maduro. “All agreed that Maduro had to go,” Mr Bolton said.Thus far, Mr Maduro has refrained from detaining Mr Guaido, but the president said Tuesday night that Venezuela’s chief prosecutor was assigning three deputies to investigate the uprising and promised there “will be criminal charges”.“What do they want, a military battle ” Mr Maduro asked, seated beside the Venezuelan flag. “Does that benefit Venezuela, democracy, peace ”"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures workers of the world unite to mark may day","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The ferry is a real benefit to Strangford, it canrsquot be a liability.Cllr Enright claimed that the DfI ldquoin order to save on staff costs, have not been using the queuing area on the Strangford side.During a recent meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, roads officials confirmed that they were evaluating introducing an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to Strangford.Councillor Gareth Sharvin said he was also concerned about the regular traffic congestion in Strangford after being contacted by local people caught up in the weekend traffic jam.He said: ldquoI donrsquot understand why there is ferry traffic congestion when there are good ferry traffic lines around the harbour. I will be contacting the Departmentrsquos permanent secretary, Katrina Godfrey, to have a full review and overhaul of the ferry services to ensure that this does not happen again.Strangford businessman, Robert Duffy, owner of a Mace grocery store, confirmed that the village was snarled up with traffic on Saturday evening but reported traffic and the ferry had been running smoothly over the rest of the Easter bank holiday weekend.However, Mr Duffy added: ldquoThe traffic was only bad for a couple of hours on Saturday evening and it was compounded by Saturday night mass in Strangford.ldquoSaturdayrsquos problem was that there was only one boat on. There was racing in Kirkistown and you had between  and  motorhomes travelling from Bishopscourt and that happens every single year.ldquoIrsquove been here  years and it is what it is ndash holiday traffic.

The Town Committee asked for the money to go towards a two-week festival they are organising in the town this summer.But councillors bluntly pointed out this week that they have already pumping enough money into the resort for other activities and had already sufficiently helped the Town Committee.Councillors pointed out that the council had spent a ldquovery considerable amount of money in promoting a nine-week summer entertainment programme in Newcastle and had given specic help to the Town Committee in the funding of a joint press conference, advertising and publicity material, as well as providing Radio Newcastle and other facilities.Because of all this ldquoit would not be appropriate to gibe a cash grant in addition.However, the decision did not go down well with Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth, who said it was regrettable that the council had decided to give nothing to the Town Committee.She thought thatthe council could not help by giving the full pound, they should at least have given a part and she hoped the council would have another look at the request.Newcastle councillor Mr Norman Bicker, a member of the Town Committee, said he hoped the council might be able to do something, but he realised there was already a big council programme and he agreed that it was not possible to allow more money.The councilrsquos recreation officer, Mr Bryan Coburn, also pointed out that there was already considerable investment in finance and labour in Newcastle and he felt it would not be appropriate to give more.BALLYGOWAN mdash Bicycling Ballygowan minister, the Rev James Harper, peddled into town last week with a beaming smile on his face for he had just taken part in a smash hit -mile cycle to raise funds to build a new hall in his area.Mr Harper led a team of  modern bikes into Ballygowan on an  year-old penny farthing, which had been loaned to him by cycling enthusiast Albert Watson.The sponsored -mile bike ride took in Raffrey, Derryboy, the Pikestone, Crossgar and Saintfield. Between pound and pound was raised.Itrsquos not the first time Mr Harper, minister of Ballygowan Presbyterian Church, has come up with unusual ideas to raise money. When ministering in Killyleagh he took part in a sponsored bed push and also cycled on a tandem.Coping with the penny farthing proved easier than Mr Harper expected. ldquoIt was remarkably comfortable and I felt really refreshed after the journey, he said.ldquoThere was only one problem mdash it had no brakes, but the police helped us by going ahead to make sure the way was clear.The penny farthing dates from  and is ft in high. Mr Harper only got one half-hour practice to get the feel of it before setting out on the y journey.DOWNPATRICK mdash A proposal to locate a regional museum in Downpatrick has been supported by the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Board members want to be involved in the museumrsquos management together with local councillors.The recommendation is that the museum should be the responsibility of the district council, but Board member Mr Jack Magee believes the concept is too narrow.Board members want top priority to be given to recruiting a pool of staff for regional museums and that they should be seconded for proper professional training to acquire a professional qualication.Meanwhile, Down Council is pressing ahead with its own plans to establish a museum in Downpatrick.The council museum was started before the announcement that Downpatrick had been nominated as the location for a regional museum and it is believed that the council museum will be used as the basis for the regional museum.Councillors have accepted that it will be some time before money will be made available for the appointment of museum staff, so a full-time curator is now needed to enable their lsquoDown Museumrsquo to progress properly.It has been confirmed that until the appointment is made, Mr Albert Colmer, chairman of the Lecale Historical Society, will continue to act as curator.STRANGFORD mdash The Strangford Ferry fares will be increased next week, despite strong protests from Ards and Down councillors and members of Portaferry Development Committee.Representatives from all three groups recently met with the Department of Roads Service, which operates the ferry, and were told that the increases were the absolute minimum which could be implemented.Down councillor Mr John Ritchie said he was told that the fares should meet at least % of the servicersquos running costs, which now stood at nearly pound, a year.KILLYLEAGH mdash The blueprint for Killyleaghrsquos one-day festival of family fun in June was revealed at a public meeting in the Cooke Hall in the town.The planned programme, ranging from car slalom, marathon darts, senior citizensrsquo talent contest and yard of ale competition, makes impressive reading, attempting as it does to involve the whole community.ldquoWe must put Killyleagh on the map, was the message message hammered home at the meeting by Mr Winston Maguire, chairman of Killyleagh Town Committee.The organisers received an enormous boost when local hotelier Mr Harry Briggs offered free of charge for three nights the main hall of the Dunmore Hotel.The organisers have appealed for sponsorship, especially donations for prizes. The townspeople will not only enjoy the one-day festival, but any profits made from the event will be ploughed back to provide Christmas lights for the townrsquos streets.DRUMAROAD mdash Outbreaks of sheep worrying hit the area at the weekend when more than  lambs were savagely attacked and killed by marauding dogs.Mr P J McGrady, a farmer from Drumaroad, lost ten lambs over the weekend, He spotted a black dog with white spots on his land and he rushed into his house for his shotgun, but the dog had gone when he went outside.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A pair of talented Ballynahinch sisters, Lesley and Gail Newham, are among four students from the South Eastern Music Centre who travelled to Grantham in Lincolnshire with the British Youth Symphony Orchestra this week.This is the second year in succession that the sisters have been chosen to join the  young musicians from all over the UK who will be giving concerts for the next two weeks.Mr David Newham, father of  year-old Lesley, who plays a horn, and  year-old Gail, an oboeist, is director and advisor of music for the South Eastern Education and Library Board.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A speedboat with the engine still attached was found drting in Strangford Lough close to Don OrsquoNeill Island on Saturday by Mr Paul McCann, of  Springvale Park, Dpwnpatrick.The speedboat was taken to a temporary mooring at Castleward Bay provided by Strangford Sailing Club.

The event was finished off by further prayers and hymns with soup served to all.The call for the Church of Ireland community to boycott the event was ignored as several additional ministers attended the event for the first time.Former Bishop Trevor Williams, recently retired from the Church of Ireland diocese of Limerick and Killaloe and former rector of Newcastle, said he felt it was important to attend the event.ldquoThe Christian message for me is one primarily of love and concern for others and on this Good Friday thatrsquos precisely the message, the cross of Jesus Christ and what he gave to the world, he said.ldquoJesus said love one another as I have loved you so that is the importance of this day. We learn most from those who are dferent so this walk today gives us an opportunity to realise that each of our traditions have something to offer, each has something to learn from each other.Church of Ireland minister, the Rev Adrian Dorrian from the Lecale group of churches, said he felt it was important to attend the walk.ldquoWe have a similar walk of witness in Downpatrick today, he said. ldquoBut, given the coverage this year and the protest letter which we disagree strongly with, we wanted to show support. Dean Henry Hull would have been here but he has other Good Friday service commitments. Irsquom very glad to have been able to come and represent the other churches in the town.Castlewellan parish priest, Fr Denis McKinlay, said: ldquoItrsquos been a great turnout today and great show of support and solidarity from some very important people. After all it is a peace walk and itrsquos about peace, reconciliation and hope and we all have to learn from one another. Surely that has to be a great thing In welcoming the walkers to St Paulrsquos, the Rev Brian Cadden said: ldquoIt is a real sense of joy today, despite dferent expressions of the Christian faith, that we can come together to share the most basic aspect of our faith which is the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.St Malachyrsquos parishioners, Harry and Margaret McCartan from Newcastle, have attended the walk for years.Mr McCartan said why there were there: ldquoTo bear witness with our Christian neighbours, thatrsquos what it is all about, he said.ldquoThatrsquos exactly it, this is nothing to do with politics, added Mrs McCartan.He continued: ldquoWhy be a Christianyou are afraid to show it Gerald King from Annsborough said he attended the walk due to recent newspaper coverage.ldquoI came today after seeing that letter because them men are wrong, he said. ldquoLove one another as I have loved you, thatrsquos what this is about.St Malachyrsquos parishioner Mary Steele, who walks every year, said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely and peaceful and calm. Itrsquos a prayerful day and it should be. Good Friday is the day and the resurrection is the day. Let those without sin cast the first stone.Fellow St Malachyrsquos parishioner Philomena Rice was there with her three grandchildren as she has done in previous years.ldquoI think itrsquos important to show my grandchildren the other church, she said. ldquoThey like coming out to this, carrying the cross as they call it.Ronnie Hamilton, secretary of the Castlewellan Area Bible Prayer Group said: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the turnout today and itrsquos more than we normally have.

As well as the senior event, Phil Hodge organised a junior run as a selection race for an international event.These young ones are aged  to  and it was incredible that Tom Crudingtonof Newcastle AC, on a slightly shortened course, managed to cross the line even ahead of Seamus Lynch.Ciara Savage, of Newcastle AC, was the first female junior. A massive congratulations to all of the juniors who entered and hopefully we can encourage even more for the next junior race at Binnian.The ladiesrsquo event followed a similar vein with last weekrsquos winner Esther Dickson, of Newry AC in dominate form.Second place was Karen Wilton and Sarah Graham romped home in third. Poor Sarah, however, was cornered by McNeilly in the Avoca at the presentation, who was heard regaling her of his past triumphs, including his  minute k and  minute  miler.Perhaps there was some consolation for Sarah in that she wasnrsquot subjected to Joe McCann recounting his illustrious Armagh .

This week he was given an extra job in removing directional tape that is hung from branches along the race course.He complained about the use of a set of steps in setting the course out as he couldnrsquot reach most of the tape until it was explained that Phil Hodge had hung the said material.

Main buildings around the world were turned green to mark this day.ldquoAnd, as the Good Friday Agreement comes under pressure, St Patrick speaks to a shared heritage across this island. And he should be a force for reconciliation right now.Mr Coveney added: ldquoThere should never be ision in this island and we should share the richness of his story. St Patrick is a treasure to us all.ldquoA treasure to those of faith and to those with no faith at all. He challenged this island and found courage, redemption and transformation.The Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, discussed the grave of St Patrick with Mr Coveney and other clergy and politicians.Dean Hull added: ldquoSt Patrick probably died in his church at Saul and was driven by a cart and four oxen, which settled on the hill in Downpatrick, where he was buried. As was the custom, Patrickrsquos remains were subject to becoming reliquaries and part of his jaw bone is in the Down County Museum today..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traders fume at roadworks delay  ","story":"WORK on a major public realm scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick is to take more than twice as long to complete than originally planned, sparking a furious reaction from traders.Work on the near pound, scheme was due to complete at the end of March but contractors will not now be finished their work until the end of June.And, to compound tradersrsquo frustration, once contractors move off site, Irish Street will be completely closed to traffic for a short period to allow the main road to be resurfaced. It is understood that it could be early July before this work is completed.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme to provide new paving, street lighting and furniture in Irish Street with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have now arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base, but of major concern is problems with the sewer network.A series of frenetic phone calls to politicians and NI Water were made recently after raw sewage flowed out of an old section of piping for over a week.Businesses say they have been told that major sections of the sewer network need replaced and that contractors recently discovered that one large section of the sewer was completely blocked with concrete and has most probably been like this for decades.All businesses have reported a downturn in trade since work in Irish Street started and a temporary one-way traffic system was introduced, while there is concern that a number of parking spaces have been lost and that the width of the main street has been substantially narrowed in places.Calls have been issued for a rates reduction given the impact the work has had on business with traders highlighting that the delay in completing the scheme, ironically designed to help attract more shoppers, is outside their control but has had a signicant impact upon them.Mr Alan Oakes, of Plus  Print, said the sewer outside his business collapsed for eight days, with main contractors apologising for what was happening.ldquoTrade has been poor since the works started on January  and with further realistic delays forthcoming, we donrsquot know what the future might hold, he said.ldquoOne business in Irish Street has now closed, traffic is at a standstill, deliveries are impossible and collection from businesses is a nightmare while footfall is at zero. The management of the entire streetscape has been disastrous from day one and now more delays are anticipated.Mr Oakes said what concerns him most has been the lack of communication provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council. He also fears that the sewage infrastructure in Irish Street is at breaking point.He added: ldquoWe are a family-run business with  yearsrsquo experience in the town and an employer. These past few months been very testing and dficult for all businesses in Irish Street.Another trader said that given the loss in trade businesses have experienced, they should be entitled to a rates rebate.He said: ldquoWe all accepted that the street upgrade was needed but the work was supposed to take three months. Now they are saying that it will be the end of June and even into July before it is completed. What is going on ldquoEveryone has taken a hit and, given that fact, we deserve a rates rebate. Business is hard enough without having to put up with this. We were told the work would take three months, but we will be into a seventh month before this over.A spokeswoman for the Department of Infrastructure said the Irish Street scheme is a project it is managing on behalf of Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities.ldquoThis is a full refurbishment of the existing streetscape, with the provision of new street lighting, street furniture and carriageway resurfacing, she explained.ldquoUnfortunately the scheme has encountered a signicant number of unexpected delays due to utility alterations and dficulties with construction around the old blast wall foundations at the PSNI station.The spokeswoman confirmed that in consultation with the contractor carrying out the work, it is now anticipated that further delays are ldquounfortunately unavoidable at this stage with the finish date of the main paving works now expected to be June .She also revealed that a full road closure will then be required to carry out resurfacing of the carriageway.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWhile we appreciate this unavoidable delay has caused concern, please be assured that all measures to expedite works are being taken.South Down MLA, Colin McGrath, said it was ldquodisappointing to learn that the completion of roadworks at Irish Street have been delayed until the end of June.ldquoWhile residents and business owners will want to see the work completed to the highest standard, that this will be at the cost of another two monthsrsquo interruption which is disheartening. If the work can be completed ahead of schedule this would be welcomed, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Work set to resume at old Downe  ","story":"BUILDING work on a new social housing project at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick is due to resume in the near future.Contractors moved off site a few weeks ago after laying foundations for a number of new homes whichare being built on behalf of Clanmill Housing.An initial  homes are being built part as part of a major social housing project at the site where around  new homes could eventually be constructed.While concern has recently been expressed locally about the halt to construction work at the site,Clanmill has explained that there is a valid reason.The social housing provider said it is aware that work at the sprawling town centre site mdash which borders four main roads mdash has ceased for a short period of time.ldquoThe developerrsquos subcontractor is awaiting the arrival on site of a piling rig to allow work to continue, she explained.ldquoWe appreciate the continued support and patience of local residents as construction continues and are looking forward to welcoming families to the first phase of the development later in the year as planned.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.Itrsquos understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, is pleased that the suspension to building work is only temporary.ldquoThe redevelopment of the former hospital site will go some way to reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick, he said.ldquoThe Clanmill project is an eagerly awaited development. Not only will it provide much-needed new homes, but greatly assist with the social and economic regeneration of this particular part of the town. People are eager to see the first tenants move into their new homes and the transformation of this particular site.Cllr Curran said he is also pleased that tenants could be in their new homes later in the year.ldquoWe have a number of people on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category. They will no doubt be eagerly monitoring the progress of building work at the old Downe complex, he continued.Cllr Curran added: ldquoHaving viewed plans for the redevelopment of the entire site, I can say that they are particularly impressive and will transform what had become a blot on the landscape into a vibrant, and much-needed social housing development..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17591064.council-election-2019-erne-west/resources/images/9783052.jpg","title":"life without art would be empty and unsatisfying","story":"JC: What is your artistic background JC: What inspires your art JC: Is there a specic place that you do your work JC: What has been your most ambitious piece to date JC: What dferent artistic media do you use and which is your favourite JC: What are you currently working on JC: Do you exhibit your work anywhere JC: Any new artistic ventures planned for  JC: What are you up to when you arenrsquot painting JC: What does your art mean to you This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

eight, episode three of Game of Thrones. Directed by Miguel Sapochnik – who also helmed fan-favourite episodes including ‘Hardhome’ and ‘Battle of the Bastards’ – last night’s instalment ‘The Long Night’ was billed as one of the longest and largest battle scenes ever committed to film or TV.And while the episode was filled with explosive and grisly scenes of warfare, some have been complaining that they were straining to see the battle, due to the episode’s apparently darker-than-usual cinematography.One Twitter user wrote: “Tried to watch Game Of Thrones tonight but the episode was too dark to see anything. It sounded very exciting though!”Another said: “I’ve been watching ep for  minutes, still don’t know what’s going on it’s too dark.”Some have suggested that people could have solved the issue by adjusting the settings on their TV’s, with one person stating: “Did people forget they can increase the brightness and contrast on their TVs ”Another claimed it may have been due to the limitations of streaming services: “One of the reasons for the ‘it’s too dark’ complaints about the new Game of Thrones is because so many will be streaming it. Many streaming services are still poor when it comes to video encoding for dark scenes.”However, plenty of viewers seemed to have no problem and were left wondering what all the fuss was about“Turn your light off, close your blinds and stop whining,” one Twitter user wrote.Another said: “I saw what I needed to see. Arya kicked butt. And the red woman came back and helped. Theon protected Bran till the end. Jorah protected Dany.”“I guess its winterfell’s fault for not having proper street lighting,” joked another.Man dies after being hit by two vehicles in Hampshire town Cranleigh School opens new

He said that there were areas which “unionism has in the past only touched on a superficial basis, perhaps because of perceptions that it was not worth it given the lack of potential votes”.Mr Dougan accepted that abortion was not primarily an issue for local government but said that it was a topic on which he felt passionately and “I believe these big issues are important” and councillors had a role in lobbying beyond their council work. However, he said that  posters were removed in what he believed was “an organised exercise”.Mr Ó Coigligh said: “I have found huge support for the DUP stance on abortion in nationalist republican areas ... people as erse as a former GAA county captain and a former member of the UDA who served a sentence in Long Kesh in the early s said that cross-community support for the DUP was the way forward and that they admired my modest efforts in this regard.”Mr Dougan said that he had respect for the Irish languaage – and Mr Ó Coigligh translated one of his booklets on Orangeism into Irish – but did not support an Irish language act.DUP-Free Presbyterian tension as party’s gay candidate choice moves it further from church roots Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID

It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The report said: ldquoMany universities have made a considerable effort to address this gap over several years with collaborative work between university leaders, staff and studentsrsquo unions, but there is still a long way to go.ldquoEliminating these attainment dferentials and transforming the university experience for BAME students will require sustained work from across the higher education sector.Led by Baroness Valerie Amos, director of SOAS, and Amatey Doku, vice president for higher education at the NUS, UUK and the NUS have been working with universities and students since June  to tackle the disparity between the proportion of top degrees achieved by white and BAME students. The report follows contributions from  universities and student unions and six regional roundtable evidence sessions with  attendees on how the attainment gap should be tackled.Five steps for universities to improve BAME student outcomes have been identied and include providing strong leadership and having conversations about race and cultures.The other three recommendations are developing racially erse and inclusive environments, getting the evidence and analysing the data, and working together to understand ldquowhat works.Baroness Amos said: ldquoOur universities are racially and culturally erse, compared to many other sectors, but we are failing a generation of studentswe donrsquot act now to reduce the BAME attainment gap.ldquoWhile many universities are proactive on the issue, this report and its recommendations aims to deliver transformation in our sector.ldquoIt is important that universities act and are transparent in their approach so black, Asian and minority ethnic students are given the best chance of success. Inaction is not an option.Mr Doku said: ldquoFrom decolonising the curriculum to more culturally competent support services, many students and studentsrsquo unions have been fighting and campaigning for action in this area for years and this report highlights good practice, and clear practical steps for universities to take to begin to respond to many of the concerns raised..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uLong way to go u to eliminate BAME attainment gap at universities article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail.

The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/DEB.jpg","title":"debenhams pushes on with cva and store closures","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business Debenhams has launched its cost-saving plans as it reveals it will push forward with the closure of  of its stores next year, it has emerged. The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive. With margins so tight, that tax burden is making le dficult for high street retailers.\"View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Email-640x315.jpg","title":"it firm pinnacle hosting event at kingspan stadium","story":"Posted on Tuesday  April  by Ulster Business A leading IT firm will host an event at the home of Ulster Rugby at an event to help educate and inform businesses.
