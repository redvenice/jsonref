butcher\u0027s shop relevant.But despite his efforts to ersify by baking pies, curing meats and making ready meals, gradually rising business rates have threatened to push Hayman\u0027s Butchers off the high street.Although they do not have to pay rent on the building in Sidmouth, Devon, because his grandfather bought it outright in 1907, his business rates are £12,000 a year.Mr Hayman said:

I\u0027m really done seeing that. It\u0027s just negative.\u0027      Premise: The show will feature several people loosely connected to royals living together in the English countryside. Tyler is the only AmericanMr Dooley\u0027s girlfriend Sandra Bazan, his mother Tracy, 53, and brother Thomas, better known as TJ, 26 are also set to appear on the show, according to the Sunday Mirror.Tyler admits in the clip that he didn\u0027t watch his \u0027Auntie Meghan\u0027s\u0027 wedding on TV, though he did fly to the UK for the festivities.  \u0027I didn\u0027t watch the royal wedding. Sorry Meghan, I didn\u0027t. I went over there, I was in London to support my Aunt Meghan,\u0027 he says.\u0027Honestly, with the controversy that\u0027s happened with my family, all I wanted to do was show my support.\u0027          Though Tyler was not invited to the Duchess\u0027 wedding to Prince Harry, he did fly to London to celebrateHe adds: \u0027My favorite member of the royal family would be my lovely Aunt Meghan because I don\u0027t know anybody else in the royal family.MTV bosses are believed to have taken an interest in Tyler after his run-in with London police just hours after the Royal wedding in Windsor.He was caught with a knife and pepper spray at a nightclub in Kingston upon Thames, which he surrendered to police and managed to avoid arrest.Speaking at the time of the incident, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: \u0027Police were called by security to a club in Union Street, Kingston upon Thames, in the early hours of Sunday, 20 May, after a man openly declared he had a knife as he attempted to enter the club. \u0027When officers arrived at 1.55am enquiries led them to a hotel in Kingston and two men in their 20s were spoken to by officers in connection with the incident.\u0027One of the men also voluntarily surrendered a noxious spray. Both men, who were visitors to the UK, were warned about their actions. Neither was arrested, no further action was taken and inquiries are complete.\u0027          How they\u0027re related: Tyler is the youngest son of Meghan\u0027s half brother Thomas Markle Jr. (pictured)In the preview clip for the show, he seems to allude to this, saying: \u0027The most outrageous thing that\u0027s ever happened to me on a night out, honestly, I\u0027m not gonna say anything about that.\u0027A source told the Mirror that producers cast the young man because of how different he is from his aunt.They said: \u0027Producers are fascinated by Tyler and his family, and how different their lives are from Meghan\u0027s.\u0027They think viewers will love him and the rest of the Dooleys, and become gripped by their soap opera lives. Tyler is really looking forward to it and sees it as great advertising for his marijuana business.\u0027Tyler was not invited to the Royal wedding, but flew over with his mother and brother, who were recruited by the news show Good Morning Britain as \u0027special correspondents\u0027.But unfortunately they never appeared on TV after Tyler\u0027s run-in with police. Meghan’s nephew, the marijuana farmer and TV star | Times2 | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"China prepares build airport Antarctica","story":"    Researchers board China\u0027s first polar airplane Snow Eagle 601 for a trial flight in 2015          China will build its first airbase in the Antarctica near its Zhongshan research station (pictured)China\u0027s president warns military chiefs to prepare for WAR...Twenty-one killed in mining accident in China after rock...Chinese man desperate for a son sells his 10-day-old...Out-of-control tanker slams into car and crushes it into a...Share this articleAccording to plan, the airport will have a 1,500-metre-long (4,921-foot-long), 80-metre-wide (262-foot-wide) runway. A group of Chinese scientists and researchers will leave for the Antarctica on Friday and  their main task is to build the airbase, reported Xinhua News Agency.The facility will be the home base of China\u0027s first polar fixed-wing aircraft, Snow Eagle 601.The aircraft has a cruising speed of 380 kilometres (236 miles) per hour, a maximum range of 3,440 kiometres (2,137 miles) and a maximum take-off load of 13 tonnes, but it has been using a Russian airfield since it was unveiled in 2015.To build a permanent airbase, the ice sheet will need to have stable and slow movement. And to ensure the spot they had picked was suitable, Chinese researchers built a weather station there in 2015 before spending a year observing the ice sheet and its movement, said the Xinhua report, quoting Science and Technology Daily.     This photo taken on September 10, 2018 shows Xuelong 2, China\u0027s first domestically-built icebreaker, being launched at a shipyard in ShanghaiThere are more than 20 airports in Antarctica at present, and they belong to Western countries including Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Chinese experts expect that the new airbase will help researchers carry out larger expeditions to the Antarctica.China aims to become a \u0027super power\u0027 in the polar regions in terms of scientific exploration, said a previous Xinhua report.

I think it is at best doubtful.Over the years, Charles has established close working and personal ties with royal Arab leaders. \u0027I was lucky to have known him\u0027: Prince William leads...\u0027Publicity-hungry\u0027 Prince Harry gazumped his father Charles...Share this articleHe is well respected in the Gulf States and Middle East, not least for his sympathetic speeches about Islam. Like Blair, he studied the Koran in depth and has even, over years, learned Arabic.When corresponding with Arab leaders he always signs his name in Arabic, another small nod to respecting the other culture. Indeed, he thinks Islam can teach us all a way of understanding and living in the world, which sadly, he believes, Christianity is poorer for having lost.Prince Charles believes that, by shackling Britain to the flawed Bush administration, Tony Blair missed a golden opportunity to forge an alternative consensus, one that both secured the crucial support of Arab leaders and embraced their unique perspective and understanding of the often troubled region.Privately, he castigated both President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Blair\u0027s combative role in Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 2003 military invasion of Iraq.          The prince was diametrically opposed to the Blair–Bush Iraq War strategy. He believed that, by shackling Britain to the flawed Bush administration, Tony Blair missed a golden opportunity to forge an alternative consensusHis views did not come with hindsight. Charles made his no-nonsense position clear to those in power at the time.He told political figures and those in his trusted circle that he regarded the Bush Administration as \u0027terrifying\u0027 and pilloried what he believes was Blair\u0027s lack of perspicacity. He believed Blair had behaved like Bush\u0027s \u0027poodle\u0027 and said so.One of his circle revealed: \u0027Whenever he followed in the wake of the Prime Minister on an overseas visit he would quote a phrase dryly, \u0027Thou shalt go behind the rear of the Lord to declare his song.\u0027 It would always get a laugh.\u0027Indeed, the Prince of Wales cast serious doubt on the government\u0027s 2002 intelligence dossier long before the BBC report in May 2003 that it had been \u0027sexed up\u0027.           Prince Charles told political figures and those in his trusted circle that he regarded the Bush Administration as \u0027terrifying\u0027As for George W. Bush, Charles believed the president \u0027lacked intelligence\u0027 and said Bush would always remain a \u0027mystery\u0027 to him.On Blair, the Prince was even more condemnatory. With a heavy dollop of irony, he scornfully dubbed the premier \u0027our magnificent leader\u0027 whenever talking about him in private and derided him for ignoring the wealth of sound intelligence available to him at the time that contradicted the American view.Charles repeatedly told friends that Blair should have listened to Arab leaders about how to act over Iraq.The Arab rulers had told him again and again how uneasy they were about Blair becoming so closely aligned with Bush and how \u0027bewildered and saddened\u0027 they were by the UK\u0027s position in being \u0027tied to the USA\u0027s coat-tails\u0027 over Iraq. Charles asked one high-level source damningly: \u0027Why did Mr Blair do it, despite what they must all have been telling him before the conflict about the dangers of stirring the hornets\u0027 nest up in this part of the world?\u0027          The Prince of Wales (pictured with sons William and Harry) repeatedly told friends that Blair should have listened to Arab leaders about how to act over Iraq\u0027The Prince,\u0027 one senior source and former member of the Royal Household said, \u0027had a very clear position on the West\u0027s so-called democratisation of Iraq and the region, based on years of study and conversations with leaders there.\u0027HRH did try very hard to engage senior figures on this, but nobody in government wanted to listen to a word he said. Their minds were made up.\u0027When given the opportunity, the Prince would point out why the delicate differences in culture in the region were crucial to understand. It was a region dominated by tribal loyalties, and still is. So marching in carrying a banner for Western-style democracy was both foolhardy and futile.One of the Prince\u0027s circle, who was fully aware of his views at the time, said: \u0027The Prince was wise enough to foresee that. Why weren\u0027t the politicians of the day?\u0027The 2003 invasion of Iraq lasted from March 20 to May 1. In the immediate aftermath of the war, Charles found the United States and United Kingdom government \u0027solutions\u0027 to be both naive and inept.The Prince privately questioned the legitimacy of so-called \u0027democratic elections\u0027 that followed when it was happening against a background of intimidation, violence and inter-tribal feuding.One impeccable source said: \u0027Around this time the Prince grew increasingly frustrated with the Iraq issue. It left him deeply depressed.\u0027 Another informed source told me: \u0027I remember one evening when the Boss was particularly animated on this subject.\u0027He was very critical of the Bush administration and the President in particular, saying that he felt our children\u0027s futures appear to be in the hands of what he described as an \u0027awful\u0027 administration and it absolutely terrified him. He just didn\u0027t trust them one bit.\u0027          According to sources, the Prince (pictured at Balmoral Castle) thought it was \u0027absolutely extraordinary\u0027 that neither the Americans nor those in authority in the UK ever seemed to listen to the Arab perspectiveThe Prince, according to sources, maintained it was \u0027absolutely extraordinary\u0027 that neither the Americans nor those in authority in the UK ever seemed to listen to the Arab perspective or consider their knowledge of Iraq and its religious and tribal complexities when seeking postwar solutions there.Ignoring their perspective, the Prince felt, was fatal and had led to what he described as \u0027the bewildering mess we are facing now at home and abroad\u0027.One former member of the Prince\u0027s household ulged that Charles was completely baffled by Bush and his stance in totally ignoring the advice of local leaders.\u0027The Prince could not understand the sense in America\u0027s position,\u0027 the source said, \u0027which was a need to revisit the \u0027crazy\u0027 de-Baathifican policy (sacking professionals who were members of Saddam Hussein\u0027s B\u0027aath party) that had led to the exclusion of so many badly needed professional people throughout Iraqi society and turned so many people against the coalition.\u0027Charles, the source said, was particularly derogatory about Bush\u0027s Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice — the first black woman to hold that post — and the extent of what he deemed U.S. ignorance of the Middle East. The Prince couldn\u0027t fathom why Ms Rice resisted all requests to visit the area.And some of her statements left him cold, such as: \u0027The people of the Middle East share the desire for freedom. We have an opportunity — and an obligation — to help them turn this desire into reality.\u0027\u0027But what does that actually mean and how on earth were they going to implement it?\u0027 he would question.In the Prince\u0027s view, the only way proper democracy will ever be achieved in Iraq, and the West will stand any chance of winning the war on terror is by dealing with the \u0027real toxin\u0027 infecting the whole world: the Israel– Palestine question.He maintains that the West must also focus on education and resisting what he believes is a \u0027terrible distortion\u0027 of Islam and how it is perceived.Only then, he believes —when the wider world embraces the real Islam, combined with a serious collaborative effort to find a workable solution to the Israel–Palestine question — will the rage that drives the war on terror start to wane.            Prince Charles and Princess Diana leave Gibraltar on the Royal Yacht Britannia for their honeymoon cruise in 1981. Prince Charles still keenly misses the royal yacht, which was decommissioned in 1997He pointed out that on his 2018 Australian tour he’d convened a round-table meeting with big-business CEOs to examine the challenges faced by the world’s ocean reefs. Yet senior representatives from Australia’s mining industry had failed to show up, and other industry leaders had sent more junior executives to represent them.Charles was clearly a little peeved, reflecting that this wouldn’t have happened if the meeting had been aboard Britannia. Whenever she was due in port, the British Ambassador — who advised on invitations — was suddenly the most popular person in the entire country, he said.

Taking other data into account, it is unlikely Dfid saved that many lives through family planning interventions within such a short timescale.’In total, around 75 per cent of the mothers’ lives Dfid estimated that it had saved around the world were as a result of family planning interventions, such as contraception or abortions.Mad scientist: Brynne Edelsten’s ex jailed for cooking up a...African £112k \u0027Queen of Oxfam\u0027 is moving charity HQ from...Nurse who allegedly hurt her back trying to save a 126...Can it be true that crooked lawyers are helping asylum...Share this articleBut Icai questioned the modelling used, which, for example, did not take into account factors such as the age of the women.It added: ‘We find that the intensive focus on family planning, while valuable in its own right, has left the wider maternal health portfolio without a balanced approach across the different interventions that are needed to achieve significant reductions in maternal mortality over the medium to long term.’Dr Alison Evans, Icai’s chief commissioner, who led the review, said: ‘Every year, more than 300,000 women die from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth and the majority of these deaths are in the poorest countries.‘The UK is clearly committed to improving maternal health, and Dfid has successfully expanded access to crucial services. However, given the ambition, need and level of investment, the programmes fell short of what was required to achieve adequate progress.’          Theresa May announced during the general election campaign last year that the Government would keep the controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aidProjects funded by Dfid include a £109.9million scheme to improve basic health care, family planning and the skills of health workers in Malawi.Some £139million of British aid money was handed to Marie Stopes International to reduce maternal deaths from unwanted pregnancies by offering family planning services.Ministers have been under pressure to improve how the overseas aid budget is spent following Theresa May’s announcement during the general election campaign last year that the Government would keep the controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid.Figures released earlier this year showed Britain is one of only seven countries around the world to meet the target.The UK foreign aid budget soared by £555million to a record £13.9billion last year. It has more than doubled from the £6.4billion spent in 2008 and more than quadrupled from the £3.3billion doled out in 2002. Britain has met the 0.7 per cent target every year since 2013.Dfid said last night that its estimates of lives saved were based on the best possible information available at the time.A spokesman said: ‘The UK is a global leader on supporting sexual and reproductive health and women’s rights and thanks to UK aid, millions more women now have access to contraception.‘We welcome Icai’s acknowledgement that UK aid is helping women around the world access the life-saving services they need, but it is disappointing the report has made some generalisations from a selected portion of our programming and also does not fully reflect the full impact of our work, especially in recent years.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/30/03/51C90E5800000578-6331721-image-a-6_1540868678631.jpg","title":"Powerful earthquake shakes New Zealand Prince Harry Meghan Markles royal visit","story":"    A powerful earthquake has struck New Zealand \u0027s North Island, which the Duke and Duchess of Sussex (pictured with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern) are visiting on their royal tour          The 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit near Taumarunui. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are visiting Auckland about 280km north          The tremor was one of the largest felt in the country since a 7.8 magnitude quake struck near Kaikoura in the South Island in November 2016, killing twoThe earthquake was reported as \u0027strong\u0027 and \u0027widely felt\u0027 by GeoNet, with a depth of 193km. People reported feeling the quake in Christchurch on the South Island, which is 800km away. The earthquake forced at least two planes to abort their scheduled landings in Wellington. Civil Defence Minister Kris Faafoi warned people to be prepared for aftershocks.Mr Faafoi said he was unsure if the royals had been affected.Duchess of Wellingtons!

One African American artist, Betye Saar, answered. She created an artwork from a “mammy” doll and armed it with a rifle.“It’s about keeping everything clean, keeping politics clean, keeping your life clean, your actions clean,” said Wendy NE Ikemoto, the society’s associate curator of American art. “She wants America to clean up its act and a lot of her art has to do with this idea that we haven’t cleaned up our act.”Saar, 92, was born in Los Angeles and turned to making political art after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. “After his assassination in 1968, her work became explicitly political,” said Ikemoto. “That’s when she started collecting these racist, Jim Crow figurines and incorporated them in her assemblages.”Saar was part of the black arts movement, the cultural – often literary – arm of the black power movement of the 1960s and 1970s she was also among so-called second wave feminists. But she still found herself at a crossroads. “The black arts movement was male-dominated and the feminist movement was white-dominated,” Ikemoto said. “Being at the intersection of both movements, she became one of the most prominent black female artists for presenting strong, recognized women who are fighting off the legacy of slavery. I think it did open doors for other artists to follow.”This traveling exhibit, from the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles, shows Saar’s consistent message through her washboard series. “Many of her works tackle broad issue of revisioning derogatory stereotypes to agents of change, historical change and power,” said Ikemoto. “Many artworks feature descendants of Aunt Jemima and mammy figures armed to face racist histories of our nation.”The exhibit includes Extreme Times Call for Extreme Heroines, a washboard piece Saar made in 2017 that features a mammy doll holding a pair of guns. The washboards are used in lieu of canvases and are loaded with symbolism.“The washboard becomes her frame for the art, it’s the star,” said Ikemoto. “It’s the structure of black labor and she is moving it from a space of invisibility to highlight it. She is also using this humble object of hard labor to subvert notions of fine art.”Each washboard is like a puzzle to be decoded, filled with small details that reference American history. There are Black Panther fists, references to police brutality and phrases from the Harlem renaissance poet Langston Hughes.There are also references to Memphis, the city where King was assassinated, and to the Congolese slaves who were killed under the Congo Free State. Some washboards include phrases such as “national racism”.“It’s interesting how racism is so entrenched in our nation, it has become a national brand,” said Ikemoto. “She takes something that is a sign of oppression and violence, something pejorative and derogatory, and transforms it into something revolutionary.”Not all of the artworks are on washboards, however. One piece from 1997, We Was Mostly ’Bout Survival, is on an ironing board, emblazoned with an image of a British slave ship.“I think this exhibition is essential right now,” said Ikemoto. “I hope it encourages dialogue about history and our nation today, the racial relations and problems we still need to confront in the 21st century.”All of Saar’s artworks are made with recycled materials, often found in secondhand shops. “Assemblage is about using recycled materials, found objects from the past,” said Ikemoto. “Just by recycling assemblages, her work is suggesting we haven’t gotten over these histories. The slavery of Jim Crow still holds currency today. The idea is that with each cycle of history, the world gets a little bit cleaner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/538b6c45a1a764c6dd252583e2c272980bbe8417/0_522_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ede4f2cd3f24602d3a5f048f02e7b202","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Halloween approaches and tiojo has been doing some appropriate reading:I’ve just put down Andrew Michael Hurley’s second novel based in the countryside of the Bowland Fells and the Fylde, Devil’s Day. It follows on well from his first, The Loney. The countryside, which I know well enough, inspires him. But he sees things in it not many of us would. What to us are rolling moors, green valleys, sparkling streams, picturesque farmsteads, signify something else to Mr Hurley. He sees another world. Spiritual, demonic, folkloric, who knows. An unsettling mixture of real and imagined geography gives us the horror version of Le Grande Meaulnes. His novels are psychogeography in action. The moors will look different next time I walk across them.On the same theme, Veufveuve has enjoyed Mary Shelley’s Transformation:A slim collection of short stories (comprising the title story, The Mortal Immortal, and The Evil Eye). All three stories are in some way supernatural or uncanny and the writing, though obviously touched by the gothic and thus sometimes a little overblown, is often very good – she knew what she was doing. All three stories, like Frankenstein, explore what it means to be human and how we might live. For me, by the far the most effective was The Mortal Immortal (I probably don’t need to explain the subject matter), bringing home its great existential crisis very powerfully.A different kind of monster has entertained Kevin Dawson in Craig Brown’s Ma’am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret:That rare thing, a genuinely unputdownablelaugh out loud book. Difficult to tell who was the less appealing, Princess Margaret herself or the people who (as Brown notes) happily accepted invites to events at which she would be present, knowing how awful it (and she) would be. They attended seemingly only so they could then skip off home to describe how awful the event was. Increased my respect for George Harrison, though (who, on being told he couldn’t eat before she left a “do” simply went up to her and asked her to leave).This Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson has impressed 17Luftballons:It’s about the captain of the Beagle and Darwin. Echoes of Patrick O’Brian’s naval novels but it’s the detail and description that really bring it to life, so vivid and well-described I almost feel like I’m watching a film, or that I’ve visited all these places I’ve never seen. The characters are fascinatingly nuanced and human. And their debates over theology versus their scientific discoveries are really bringing home to me the significance and impact of evolutionary theory at the time. Nice and long, too - I don’t want it to end any time soon!A forensic and very readable analysis of The Iliad and the different strands that informed its creation. Utterly fascinating and totally recommended for armchair Homer fans and general readers alike.Here’s a teaser from casaleiro:About 10 days ago the  carried an interview with a Spanish writer who recommended A High Wind in Jamaica by Richard Hughes. Never heard of it! So down the town I went and found a copy in a charity shop. It was a fabulous discovery, and I am currently following it by re-reading William Golding’s Lord of the Flies. What the two have in common is their view of childhood as a wild and potentially violent state of being. I guess most readers are familiar with Golding. Concerning the older novel by Hughes (1929), I will say nothing, I simply urge people to read it, preferably without knowing anything about it beforehand.I’m intrigued. Talking of suspense, franhunny has been reading Agatha Christie’s Mrs McGinty’s Dead:While I usually loathe Poirot because of his smugness, it was not as bad as in other Poirot novels so I could live with it as a quirk.Which made the book quite enjoyable. Oh, I knew the murderer after the second murder, but I did not know why yet and how the two murders were connected.A classic whodunnit, with the classic “all suspects into the same room” finale where Mr Poirot explains his thoughts.A few hours well spent.(I’m glad it felt like a good investment of time, because we’re going to be looking at Agatha Christie on the reading group next month.)Finally, Tropic of Capricorn by Henry Miller has done the trick for judgeDAmNationIII:I’m about halfway through rereading and my God is it the tonic I need at the moment. I remember being relatively unimpressed with it the first time around (at least compared to the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy and Black Spring, which I read first), and although there are parts that go on a bit, the rest of it just feels like it’s screaming directly into my soul.That sounds pretty good to me.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

It is one of honking, tire-screeching, yelling chilango curses out of sedan windows and, more recently, glimpsing occasional plants among the sea of grey concrete.The Via Verde project has focused on “turning Mexico City’s grey to green” through the construction of vertical gardens on columns along the Periférico highway, which rings the central city. The photogenic plants climbing up the freeway barriers have featured in countless videos in the local and international media, and often referenced as a sign of the polluted city’s changing priorities.However, a small but vocal group of activists argues that the government’s support for Via Verde indicates its willingness to double-down on car culture in a city that is already choked with traffic and smog. The “greening” of the highway is simply making car ownership marginally more pleasant, they say.“In Mexico City, almost all of our local pollution and mobility problems can be attributed to the excessive use of private cars,” says Sergio Andrade-Ochoa, public health coordinator for the NGO Liga Peatonal. “We could just plant trees, but there’s a political fear of limiting the space in the city that is currently devoted to cars.”The idea for Via Verde emerged in 2016, when architect Fernando Ortiz Monasterio of the firm Verde Vertical started a Change.org petition to gauge public support. The petition outlines specific goals: promising to “produce enough oxygen for more than 25,000 residents, filter more than 27,000 tonnes of harmful gas yearly, capture more than 5,000kg of dust, and process more than 10,000kg of heavy metals”.The petition also assured supporters of the project’s minimal impact: the vertical garden technology does not jeopardise a wall’s structural integrity, while drip irrigation uses rainwater and other non-potable sources. Monasterio’s friend, the actor Luis Gerardo Méndez, helped publicise the petition and it quickly amassed the 80,000 signatures needed to attract government attention. Verde Vertical was approved.“All these groups were involved in revising this citizen proposal because it sounded like something that would do Mexico City good,” said the former head of Mexico City’s government, Miguel Ángel Mancera Espinosa, in 2016. “Via Verde could simultaneously change the look of the city and help us meet today’s biggest commitment: the fight against climate change.”Construction on greening the 1,000 concrete columns began later in 2016 and, so far the plants are thriving. Monasterio, sitting at the window of his office overlooking the Via Verde, is pleased with the way things have worked out: “I’m a capitalist-environmentalist,” he says with a laugh.Others, however, are less pleased. The Liga Peatonal says the project has failed to live up to its environmental promises. In a pointed comment piece on the online news site Animal Politico, Juan Manuel Berdeja and Sergio Andrade Ochoa reminded residents that improving air quality and combatting climate change are not the same thing.While plants are crucial for combating climate change, using plants to mitigate air pollution through the process of phytoremediation – changing carbon into oxygen – is more complex. Only a few species have the capacity to purify the air in the way that the Via Verde petition indicated, and the succulents and other plants Verde Vertical favours for their low maintenance needs are not among them.The current Via Verde website has no mention of local anti-pollution benefits, and Monasterio acknowledges that the carbon reduction impact of the project is negligible. Roberto Remes of the city’s Autoridad del Espacio Público says that meeting greenhouse gas and local emissions goals was “never the intention”.One graphic illustrates that building a single Via Verde column costs the same as planting 300 trees. In a city with a deficit of green space, it is a powerful image.While Via Verde is privately funded, it is an effort that the government has eagerly co-signed. The Liga Peatonal is among several activists groups who believe the project is a facelift that distracts from other, less-sustainable actions that the city has recently taken.“The idea of turning a grey city green feels good to its inhabitants. But in reality it’s just aesthetics. At the end of the day, it’s not going to change the city.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02be81f79b3e678c3e65721e49e2c5fc67772d17/0_63_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e80906a04084cf9f71a5d71431c439a7","title":"angela merkel exit gaping hole centrist politics","story":"Turning points in world affairs form flashbulb memories, vivid snapshots of the scene when we heard the news: declarations of war assassinations natural disasters. They form the album of shared memories that defines each generation.On the November morning in 1990 when Margaret Thatcher resigned, I was at school. I can picture the very classroom. The teacher took the unprecedented step of wheeling in a TV so we could watch the Iron Lady’s momentous departure from Downing Street. I had no notion of what it was like to have a different prime minister. French friends say it was the same for them when François Mitterrand stood down in 1995, after 14 years in the Elysée palace. It took a while to get used to hearing the words “monsieur le president” in reference to a different face.And so there will be a generation of Germans who struggle to get their heads around the idea of politics without Angela Merkel. They don’t have to adjust overnight. Merkel has signalled that she will not seek re-election as leader of her Christian Democratic Union party – a role she has occupied since 2000. She has been chancellor since 2005 and can carry on in that post, but yesterday’s declaration effects a status shift from leader to caretaker. Merkel’s domestic position has been shaky since elections last year forced her into an unstable coalition with a debilitated Social Democratic party. That partnership elevated the far-right Alternative für Deutschland to the status of principal opposition party by default. Subsequent regional ballots have reinforced the sense of malaise in Germany’s political centre, as voters migrate towards the fringe. A poll in Hesse over the weekend was won by the CDU, but the party’s share dropped by more than 11 points. The SPD also shed support, while the Greens and AfD made significant gains.Germany is moving on from the Merkel era. The transition will be drawn out, but the confirmation is still a flashbulb moment across Europe. Length of service is only part of the story. Merkel has seen world leaders come and go. Tony Blair was her first British counterpart. She indulged David Cameron as the “naughty nephew” of whom she tried to make a responsible European. She warned him against trying to placate Eurosceptic backbenchers, correctly predicting that they would never be satisfied. She was apparently unimpressed when Theresa May wasted their first bilateral encounter in 2016, giving nothing away, reciting lines from a prepared script.Merkel must have had occasion to wonder what on earth happened to Britain when a buffoon like Boris Johnson could become foreign secretary, and be replaced by Jeremy Hunt, a man who can glibly equate the EU and the USSR. Merkel’s childhood was spent in communist East Germany. She knows the difference between a union of free democracies and a prison state. Where, she must ask herself, did all the grown-ups go?Meanwhile, Britain’s liberal internationalists admired Merkel’s principled embrace of Syrian refugees and marvelled at history’s capacity for irony: placing the torch of tolerance and good global governance in the hands of a German chancellor for safekeeping, and having her stand as cultural foil to a racist, demagogic ruler of the United States.There is some simplistic mythologising in the admiration of Merkel as the anti-Trump figurehead for European civilisation. (Open-border generosity hasn’t done her much good in domestic politics). But the very existence of that hagiography expresses a powerful craving for stability, maturity and dignity in global affairs. The victory in Brazil’s presidential election of Jair Bolsonaro – an aggressive far-right authoritarian – tilts the global balance another few degrees against the rule of law and towards a doctrine of swaggering, might-is-right machismo. It might be coincidence that Bolsonaro enters on one side of the stage just as Merkel prepares her exit, but that doesn’t make the contrast less poignant.In Britain, these developments were submerged in coverage of the budget, although in years to come no one will be swapping stories of where they were the day Philip Hammond delivered his 2018 fiscal set-piece. The whole show is meaningless without clarity about the UK’s relationship with the rest of Europe. The chancellor pretended to know the trajectory of the economy despite not knowing the future terms of trade with Britain’s closest neighbours. The Labour party pretended to have better ideas, because that is what the opposition does on budget day. But Jeremy Corbyn cannot describe his preferred arrangement of relations with the EU, or indeed the rest of the world, in terms any more convincing than May.The prime minister’s ambition has shrivelled to the hope that parliament can be intimidated into agreeing to whatever second-rate Brexit plan she can eke out of Brussels, for fear that something worse would emerge from the chaos of its rejection. The Labour leader’s strategy is to provoke that chaos in the hope that, somehow, power changes hands in the subsequent melee.While this pantomime plays out, Britain is not a serious or even a capable actor on the global stage. It is a case study in political dysfunction, a circus to make populists and tyrants glad and an item on the list that makes responsible politicians in Europe and the US fret about the health of liberal democracy. That anxiety is stoked by the prospect of Merkel’s departure, even if it has felt inevitable for a while.In volatile times she has served as the ambassador from a more stable era, recent enough that it feels still comforting. When she goes, that era is formally committed to memory, consigned to the past, and there opens up a terrible vacancy. It is a shaming fact that Britain is in no condition to supply a candidate to fill it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b85bc680a0c7224874d1356aaa55050314ced3c0/220_144_2503_1502/master/2503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1b5c8739a90d97c41742de11319f0c2","title":"black history month ancestors","story":"Black History Month, which runs through October, is trying to address a problem. That problem is, how to move the study of black history away from focusing solely on slavery and colonialism so that we don’t end up with an unbalanced knowledge of the past, and inadvertently confirm rather than fight prejudices about black people and people of African descent. This is why films like Black Panther, with its depiction of the fictional state, Wakanda, captured the imagination of so many: it imagined what a sub-Saharan African kingdom free from colonialism could have become.Africa, of course, has had its share of powerful real-life kingdoms down the millennia: look at the Horn of Africa, the region I come from, with its pre-Christian, Christian and Islamic kingdoms, and Ethiopia, which remained uncolonised. Other kingdoms throughout the continent fought against colonisation to their last day.I was recently asked to give a talk about how we create sustainable peace in an era of mounting tensions and isions. Part of the solution, I said, is to revise the history books, which may sound like an unusual answer, but I am an archaeologist. I became one partly because of the inadequate history curriculum in my school books. Arriving in Europe from Somalia, I found that none of my classmates knew anything about where I was from, beyond what little there was in the news about Africans and Somalis. So it was a wish to seek reconciliation through shared heritage that led me to study the past. I know how difficult it is to build a truly peaceful society unless you have justice. You get justice by taking people’s voices into account. History is that account.But most school history books are focused on the 20th-century world wars. Imagine excluding the voices and experiences of billions of people from the history of the world. How can the summary of our human experiences, exchanges and knowledge be reduced to two wars? And though we in Europe mainly study world history from a recent European gaze, even European history is not adequately reflected. I know because I am a European archaeologist. With my African perspective too, I want the history books to show that our human story is much more complex than one point of view can convey.I once excavated a Viking-age site in Uppåkra, southern Sweden, which turned out to be a cosmopolitan and spectacular place. Our excavation revealed, among other things, Abbasid dirhams from the 10th century – and the funny thing was that I, the weird African refugee, was the only one who could read them. Though I was one of the zooarchaeologists, I could also read the Kufic writing on this piece of Viking and Norse history, because I attended Qur’anic school in Mogadishu in the 1980s. Here I was looking at the encounters of Vikings and Arabs. One may go even further: not just Arabs, but also Africans in Baghdad. The Abbasid empire was powered by slaves from East Africa, who used that power to ultimately rebel and bring it down. Sitting in the field in Uppåkra, I smiled with the ancient Vikings, who would probably never have seen people like me – or Iraqis in Europe – as a threat.A recently decoded Swedish textile from the Viking age bore the words “Allah” and “Ali”. It was also reported that some of the DNA obtained from Viking graves in Sweden reveals people of Persian humour. Swedish Viking sites are not the only ones to yield Islamic imagery. The Vale of York hoard, discovered near Harrogate in 2007, contained items with Christian, Viking and Islamic religious symbolism. What does this say about the – in our minds – quintessential European culture of the Vikings? It shows they were a broad-minded bunch as a result of cultural exchange, trade and a bit of raiding, even more broad-minded than some modern Europeans.Learning the lessons of history from archaeology and genetics can be an effective way to spread peace.If we can accept that our ancestors were different from us, then we can more easily accept that our neighbours today are different from us, and that failing to reflect our interconnected humanity in the history books is a form of wilful ignorance. • Sada Mire is a visiting professor at the faculty of archaeology, Leiden University, the Netherlands"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78a294bb758d76ad063c75a606f9e56ef53abb20/0_141_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7188b91b5c37d4d4b3c7589aaca0fbd2","title":"justine greening tory leader brexit amber rudd","story":"On Monday Justine Greening did something Tory MPs are not supposed to do: she admitted she wanted to be party leader. Somehow she had missed the memo that the more desperately you want the job – and of course you do – the more lavishly you must deny it, offering to sign denials on parchment in your own blood (Michael Gove), or to first be reincarnated as an olive, or locked in a disused fridge, or decapitated by a frisbee (Boris Johnson). In fact this unwritten rule has become so ingrained in party lore that when Ruth Davidson categorically ruled out ever becoming prime minster in September this year, speculation immediately began over when her leadership bid might start in earnest.Yet here was Greening on the Good Morning Britain sofa, telling Susanna Reid she “might be prepared” to stand for the leadership. As an astonished Reid exploded with gratitude, there was a second or two where Greening herself seemed a little stunned at her own candour. But then Greening – once described by this newspaper as “the Tory party’s other blonde” – has been privately letting her ambitions be known for quite some time. This time last year, for example, a quote from an “ally” ran in a Sunday paper saying she would “run if there was a vacancy”. Calculated or not, she meant what she said.This kind of talk from an outspoken people’s vote supporter, on the morning of Philip Hammond’s budget, could have been custom designed to get Brexiteer backs up. “There is more chance of Mr Bean becoming King of England,” one indignant right-leaning Tory party member told me. And it is true that Greening has next to no hope of becoming leader should May’s premiership end before Brexit is completed. The membership is allergic to the idea of a people’s vote, and moreover Greening represents the left of the party: while Brexit is under way – and unless a second referendum is announced – a replacement for May will be drawn from the centre or the right.But beyond that date, Greening’s credibility rises. The hope among many Tory MPs is that they can distance their party from Brexit once it is over, and at the centre of this idea is the coronation of some fresh candidate, untainted by the whole business. Greening fits this portrait: she resigned as education secretary earlier this year, she hasn’t faced the sticky choices that are part of being a cabinet member during the Brexit years. She supports a second referendum, and she has cabinet experience, unlike some of the other names that have been floated (Tom Tugendhat, Johnny Mercer).She ticks other boxes too. She is from Yorkshire – fairly unusual for a Tory. She’s been banging the drum for social mobility for ages (even while at the Department of International Development, where it was hardly her brief) – a cause other members of her party are now starting to take on. And as a former accountant she has a good brain for detail, and numbers. “It’s a real pain in the neck in meetings: she’ll be able to quote lines from obscure research documents,” says one party supporter.True, she is pretty dull: just about the only memorable thing she has done is announce she was in a same-sex relationship two days after the 2016 referendum. But if she’s Maybot 2.0, this version seems to have at least got the major bugs worked out. Here, for example, is a typical interview answer about her hobbies – to compare and contrast with Theresa “fields of wheat” May. “I don’t have any strange hobbies, or a weird background. I am certainly not from a privileged family. Maybe I need to invent something to make myself more interesting – Chinese knife-throwing or something.” Boring, yes, but not totally embarrassing.If Greening does eventually stand, her biggest rival will be Amber Rudd, who hails from the same left-leaning, remainer section of the party. Both have experience in big jobs, both are clinging on to their seats by wafer-thin majorities (Greening’s is 1,554), both have a reputation for seriousness. But Rudd has recently started to soften her image – opening up, charmingly, about her personal life in interviews, talking about her sacking, and showing a little personality. That should be Greening’s next move.• Martha Gill is a freelance political journalist and former lobby correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c22dea5dac7dc70c9df9ce92635ebb707dcda02/0_93_6213_3727/master/6213.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbe0e2ed0eea69a632eca11396120bee","title":"norway for now no deal brexit mps","story":"With Theresa May in Oslo on Tuesday, the theory that we should copy Norway post-Brexit will get more oxygen.

If MPs from across the political ide fall for it, they will condemn the country to more political infighting as well as uncertainty that will be a drag on investment and the economy.Boles’s plan is a form of “blindfold” Brexit. He wants to park us in the European Economic Area (EEA) while we negotiate a long-term free trade deal like the one Canada has with the EU.The EEA is a club consisting of EU countries and three non-EU countries, all of which are part of the European Free Trade Association, and the biggest of which is Norway. Membership would give us access to the single market. We’d also avoid customs controls, which apply to Norway, because we’d stay in a temporary customs union with the EU, according to Boles.This is a deliberately ambiguous scheme that aims to appeal to both those MPs who want the softest possible Brexit and those who want a hard one. Because there would be no deadline for flipping to Canada, the softies would think we could stay in the EEA and customs union forever the hard nuts would think we could make the switch fast.And don’t be fooled by the nice “Canada” branding. The deal it has with the EU is pretty good for a country the other side of the Atlantic, but it would hurt the UK, which does almost half its trade with the EU. Pulling out of the single market would thwack our services industries quitting the customs union would gum up the supply chains of our car, aerospace and other manufacturing industries.What’s more, Norway for now isn’t even viable. As Jean-Claude Piris, former head of the European council’s legal service, has shown in a series of tweets, the whole plan is riddled with legal holes.There are also political problems. The EU would only let us park ourselves in the EEA if we agreed to keep the land border in Ireland open once we flipped to Canada. There would need to be customs and regulatory checks between Great Britain and the EU when we pulled out of the customs union and single market. So the only way to keep the Irish land border open would be to impose checks in the Irish Sea. But the prime minister has rejected that because it would split the UK.What’s more, Norway wouldn’t want us in the EEA for an indeterminate period of limbo – and its acquiescence is needed because Boles envisages us joining Efta as our route into the EEA. While Oslo says polite things about being “open” to us joining on a permanent basis, it likes being a big fish in the small Efta pond alongside Iceland and Liechtenstein. It wouldn’t want us swanning in for a few years, throwing our weight around and then swanning off again.So Norway for now is dead in the water. There is, though, a variant that could work: extending the 21-month transition deal that the prime minister has already negotiated until we nail down a trade deal a bit like Canada’s. After all, the EU has said it is open to that idea, which involves staying in the single market and customs union but not formally in the EEA.The snag is that the bloc would first insist we pay our £39bn orce bill – and agree to that Irish backstop. What’s more, it would want us to pay a membership fee of perhaps £12bn net for each extra year of a transition that could last a long time.When May toyed with “Brextra time” this month, she almost provoked a coup because it would mean following EU rules and trade policy indefinitely having without having a say in their formulation. Hardline Brexiters didn’t want us to become a “colony”. She has, for now, beaten a retreat.Boles is a clever man. So he must know the flaws in his plan. Why, then, is he touting it? Does he hope to throw enough dust in the eyes of fellow MPs that they end up rejecting May’s plan and installing his buddy Gove in Downing Street?If so, the public should beware. If any government insisted on Norway for now, the negotiations would fail and we would crash out of the EU with no deal at all.This doesn’t mean the prime minister’s lousy plan is any good either. The only sensible solution is to wait until the talks end and let the public decide in a People’s Vote whether they still want Brexit at all.• Hugo Dixon is deputy chair of the People’s Vote and chair of InFacts"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b59e9660a14f56e182e4012605fad0c4b31933e/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c00c6f04856665ded758ae710f528f70","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of towering","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘towering’The closing date is Wednesday 31 October at 10am.

Around 80 people a year are nominated and about 12 plaques are put up.“The bar is high, we are absolutely not wanting to hand out plaques to anyone. This is a serious thing about recording people who have made a significant contribution and there will be people who do not get through,” she said.The London blue plaques scheme was founded in 1866, with the first one unveiled at the birthplace of Lord Byron.It took 10 years for a woman to be recognised with a plaque when one was placed on the home of the stage actor Sarah Siddons. By 1905 only five women had plaques dedicated to them, including George Eliot.By 1986, when English Heritage took over the scheme from the Greater London Council, there were 45 plaques celebrating women.English Heritage said it had made some progress in recent years, unveiling another 80 London blue plaques dedicated to women. They include the computing pioneer Ada Lovelace, the DNA scientist Rosalind Franklin and the first woman to sit in parliament, Nancy Astor.More recent recipients include the cookery writer Elizabeth David, whose books such as A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950) and French Provincial Cooking (1960) transformed making meals from a matter of necessity to one of pleasure.Another is Agnes Arber, a botanist who published more than 90 scientific papers and eight books, including Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution (1912). A blue plaque will be erected at her home in Primrose Hill on Thursday.Three more blue plaques for prominent women are in the pipeline, English Heritage said. The women are:• The actor and Upper Norwood resident Margaret Lockwood (1916-90), one of Britain’s most popular film stars in the 1930s and 40s, whose many film roles include a bored heiress in Alfred Hitchcock’s The Lady Vanishes (1938) and the unfulfilled aristrocrat and highway robber Lady Barbara Skelton in the Gainsborough melodrama The Wicked Lady (1945).• The world war two spy Noor Inayat Khan (1914-44) who served with the Special Operations Executive and was the first female radio operator sent into Nazi-occupied France. She was captured and executed by the Gestapo in 1944. Khan was posthumously awarded the George Cross for her bravery in 1949. English Heritage said it was currently trying to find the best location for a plaque.• The traveller, archaeologist, mountaineer and diplomat Gertrude Bell (1868-1926), who played an important role in the establishment of the state known as Mesopotamia, now Iraq, after the first world war. Among her many eye-catching achievements and exploits was surviving 53 hours on a rope during a blizzard on the previously unclimbed north-east face of the Finsteraarhorn in the Swiss Alps in 1902. She was portrayed by Nicole Kidman in the 2015 Werner Herzog flop, Queen of the Desert.English Heritage said plaques for the writer Daphne du Maurier and the Bloomsbury Group artist Vanessa Bell were likely to follow but more nominations were needed, especially in the areas of science, sport and the fine arts, where women are particularly poorly represented.

Young people choosing to go to university had no choice: for the vast majority it was huge debt or no degree.These fees turn education into a cheap and nasty marketplace where universities that lie about their product can succeed. The supposed benefits of markets do not apply to higher education: students and their parents are not repeat consumers they don’t know what they are buying, while universities know very well how to tart up what they’re selling. Some institutions have become more focused on marketing, thanks to the financial incentive, than on providing a good education.Labour has said it would end tuition fees from the moment it is elected, and return our universities into institutions acting for the public good, not bodies that maximise profit. However, the party as yet has no policy on what to do about outstanding student loans – how to soften the injustice for students who have already racked up debt. University officials estimate that ending tuition fees and bringing back some maintenance grants would cost £10bn a year. And then there is the historic debt.Labour has been struggling to find a way forward. It cannot go into an election telling young people that if they are unlucky enough to have started university the day before a Labour government is elected, they will still have to pay off a £30,000 loan, just to cover their fees. It would not be fair on students, and would offer an incentive for them to defer entry until after a general election, leading to a sudden fall in fee income for universities, empty lecture theatres and probably redundancies in higher education.The solution, though, could be fairly simple: Labour could introduce a cap on maximum future student loan repayments for first-time undergraduate degrees, with the rest of the debts written off. The principles would be as follows. First, no student who started their course in 2012 should repay more than a student who started the same course in 2011 (when fees were a little over £3,000 a year). With interest added, that puts the debt cap for a student who started in 2012 at £12,000 (instead of anything from £30,000 upwards).Second, no student who starts their course in the year immediately before the new government is elected should pay more than one starting the same course the year after. In other words, they should pay tuition fees with a loan, but for them that loan would to be written off entirely if Labour won.Third, between 2012 and the year of a Labour election win, the maximum repayable loan should reduce fairly, as shown in the table. For those who have paid their fees up front there is no refund.If Labour wins in 2022, those who entered university in 2017 (midway between 2012 and 2022) should only have to pay back half of the maximum that any student who entered in 2011 would have to pay.The plan could be called “Jubilee 2022” – in recognition of the final year in which the cap would be implemented, exactly 10 years after exorbitant fees were introduced. If Labour is elected before 2022, the cap could begin to operate sooner.This model is fair and easy to implement. And it’s fair to those who do not go to university. The current system assumes graduates will be paid much more than non-graduates and can afford to repay vast loans. This embeds the toxic graduatenon-graduate differential, which is partly responsible for the UK’s dismal record on apprenticeships and technical education in comparison to its mainland European neighbours.How will we pay for this? The answer is another question: if the rest of Europe can do it, why can’t we? Across mainland Europe, including at all the best universities, tuition fees are either much lower or non-existent. We could raise taxes on wealth, on corporations and on people receiving the highest incomes to the levels of the rest of western Europe. Because higher education is an investment in the productivity of the economy, we should fund it through state, not inidual, borrowing.This plan would not cost as much as some might imagine because – as has become increasingly clear – many, if not the majority of graduates will be unable to pay back their loans. Some, such as medical students, even have an incentive to leave Britain – and their huge debts – never to return.At present government is paying most of the fees, but pretends it is not through an opaque relationship with the Student Loans Company and the fiction that future graduates will be as well paid as those in the past, when being a graduate was far less common. Implementing this idea moves the funding model away from the fantasy of putting things off the balance sheet.The key is that we transform a set of onerous private debts into a social obligation borne by the government – by us all collectively. This is a progressive way to fund higher education and a recognition of its status as a public good. Danny Dorling is Halford Mackinder professor of human geography at Oxford University.

It finds that the vast and growing consumption of food and resources by the global population is destroying the web of life, billions of years in the making, upon which human society ultimately depends for clean air, water and everything else.“This is far more than just being about losing the wonders of nature, desperately sad though that is,” he said. “This is actually now jeopardising the future of people. Nature is not a ‘nice to have’ – it is our life-support system.”“We are rapidly running out of time,” said Prof Johan Rockström, a global sustainability expert at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “Only by addressing both ecosystems and climate do we stand a chance of safeguarding a stable planet for humanity’s future on Earth.”Wildlife and the ecosystems are vital to human life, said Prof Bob Watson, one of the world’s most eminent environmental scientists and currently chair of an intergovernmental panel on bioersity that said in March that the destruction of nature is as dangerous as climate change.“Nature contributes to human wellbeing culturally and spiritually, as well as through the critical production of food, clean water, and energy, and through regulating the Earth’s climate, pollution, pollination and floods,” he said. “The Living Planet report clearly demonstrates that human activities are destroying nature at an unacceptable rate, threatening the wellbeing of current and future generations.”The biggest cause of wildlife losses is the destruction of natural habitats, much of it to create farmland. Three-quarters of all land on Earth is now significantly affected by human activities. Killing for food is the next biggest cause – 300 mammal species are being eaten into extinction – while the oceans are massively overfished, with more than half now being industrially fished.African elephants: With 55 being poached for ivory every day, more are being poached than are being born, meaning populations are plungingOrangutans: More than 100,000 were lost in Borneo alone between 1999 and 2015, largely due to forest destruction for timber and palm oil, leaving the great apes critically endangeredWhale sharks: Numbers of the largest fish have collapsed by two thirds in the last 75 years in the Indian and-Pacific Oceans, due to overfishing and ship collisions.Wandering albatross: Populations are declining rapidly, driven largely by accidental catches in long line fisheries. One monitored population on South Georgia fell by half between 1972 and 2010Jaguar: The razing of forests in South America is driving the decline of this big cat, which prefers to live in dense jungleGharials: There are now just 200 breeding adults of the fish-eating crocodile in the wild in India and Nepal, the result of rampant fishing, poaching and drops in river flow.Chinese giant salamander: This creature is one of 545 critically endangered amphibians, decimated by hunting for food, destruction of rivers and lakes and pollution.Hedgehog: This animal is among the fifth of UK mammals at high risk of extinction, with populations having fallen hugely in both urban and rural locations.Chemical pollution is also significant: half the world’s killer whale populations are now doomed to die from PCB contamination. Global trade introduces invasive species and disease, with amphibians decimated by a fungal disease thought to be spread by the pet trade.“It is a classic example of where the disappearance is the result of our own consumption, because the deforestation is being driven by ever expanding agriculture producing soy, which is being exported to countries including the UK to feed pigs and chickens,” he said. The UK itself has lost much of its wildlife, ranking 189th for bioersity loss out of 218 nations in 2016.The Living Planet Index has been criticised as being too broad a measure of wildlife losses and smoothing over crucial details. But all indicators, from extinction rates to intactness of ecosystems, show colossal losses. “They all tell you the same story,” said Barrett.But Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International, said the fundamental issue was consumption: “We can no longer ignore the impact of current unsustainable production models and wasteful lifestyles.”The world’s nations are working towards a crunch meeting of the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity in 2020, when new commitments for the protection of nature will be made. “We need a new global deal for nature and people and we have this narrow window of less than two years to get it,” said Barrett. “This really is the last chance. We have to get it right this time.”Tanya Steele, chief executive at WWF, said: “We are the first generation to know we are destroying our planet and the last one that can do anything about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722449c1ed9e5e0c431ebb7cf2ddc5374cfe1b76/0_0_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14a0287ed9df2978f0559a8ef41a345a","title":"atmospheric autumnal scenes london in pictures","story":"As the leaves began falling from the trees, photographer David Levene took his son Solly around London to capture autumn in all its glory"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/662ce2118e6e3e07d4eb5156b6d4099a8ad5e11a/0_106_1425_854/master/1425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3773d0e4b9a248f65840049ba5c0aed3","title":"unfashionably fashionable the best of rankin in pictures","story":"A new book charts 30 years of the fashion photographer’s work.

(Her fiance drowned after their vessel was rammed.) The book was written by Melissa Fleming, head of communications of the United Nations’ Refugee Agency. Spielberg and Abrams are due to act as producers on the project, with short-film specialist Arif Hussein as executive producer. No director has yet been announced.However, Dunham, who wrote and directed the award-winning 2010 feature film Tiny Furniture as well as creating the HBO TV series Girls, was immediately accused on social media of “whitewashing”.Among the blizzard of negative reponses, Suzanne Samin, Syrian-Cuban social media editor of Romper, wrote: “Please leave Syrian stories alone if you aren’t Syrian and especially if you are Lena Dunham. Thank you.” She also questioned whether Dunham had ever donated to refugee relief efforts, adding: “Just curious if you’ve at least done that before you profit off my people’s pain!” CNN Digital Studios reporter Neha Shastry said: “Anyone else take issue with a person who has shown very little regard for the importance of representation in her work writing a Syrian refugee’s story?” The Intercept’s Daniel Medina added that Dunham “constantly talks about representation as crucial to enrich storytelling. Yet, in practice, she has shown a disregard for actually elevating those voices. Now, she’s been signed on to write a Syrian refugee’s story? Hollywood, was no female Arab writer available?”Laura Seay, assistant professor at Colby College, Maine, said: “Surely there are storytellers who have actually been refugees, or at least had some experience with what it means to be marginalized, who could write this screenplay adaptation with authenticity \u0026amp … not white privilege. Hard to think of a worse choice for this than Dunham.”Dunham, who recently ended publication of the weekly Lenny Letter newsletter, replied to Samin on social media, writing: “If you’d ever like to discuss the project, I like to receive perspectives and engage in dialogue.” Fleming also defended the project, writing: “The book is a true story entrusted to me by Doaa. If I hadn’t written it, I am afraid it would have not been told, her voice a one-day news story. I have been given every assurance this screen adaption and movie will remain true.”Alongside her reputation as a feminism activist, Dunham has found herself at the centre of a number of controversial incidents. In 2014 she was accused of sexually molesting her sister as a 7-year-old. In 2016 she apologised for criticising football player Odell Beckham Jr’s behaviour at a Met Gala event, and later the same year apologised for joking about abortion in a podcast. In 2017 she again apologised for defending Girls writer Murray Miller after actor Aurora Perrineau accused him of rape. (No charges were filed against Miller by the Los Angeles County District Attorney, citing statute of limitations and “inconsistencies and the delay in reporting”.)Dunham’s representatives have not yet responded to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11ffc0261db6220879f2c63c436c860e6964fd72/0_957_4912_2945/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adad06899db00308ad5b1a464e1f775e","title":"nigel slater celery soup with toasted cheese","story":"A deep, satisfying soup bursting with flavourWash and trim 700g of celery.

Lopetegui was sacked by the Spanish Football Federation in June after the RFEFpresident, Luis Rubiales, claimed to have found out only five minutes before the appointment was made public and two days before the tournament began now he has been sacked by Madrid in the wake of their 5-1 hammering by Barcelona on Sunday.That defeat was Madrid’s third in a row in La Liga. The midfielder Casemiro called the team a “disaster” and described the defeat as the “image of our season”. Madrid had previously gone eight hours without scoring, 12 minutes short of their worst-ever run, and they have lost five and won only one of their past seven matches – an unconvincing 2-1 win against the Czech side Viktoria Plzen that ended with supporters whistling to show their dissatisfaction. Defeated in the European Super Cup on his competitive debut, Lopetegui has lost as many games as he has won in all competitions: six of 14.On Sunday Lopetegui insisted he had the “strength” to carry on but the decision was not his. Madrid are currently ninth in the table and the club released a statement on Monday evening confirming that they had unilaterally released the coach, who has now been sacked from the two biggest jobs in Spain in just four months. There was no press conference or appearance from the president to explain the decision.“The board understands that there is a great difference between the quality of the Real Madrid squad, that has eight players nominated for the Ballon d’Or, unprecedented in the history of the club, and the results achieved until now,” read the club statement. “We are grateful to Lopetegui and his staff and wish them the best in their professional career.”Santiago Solari, who manages Madrid’s B team Castilla, will take over on an interim basis, starting with Wednesday’s trip to face Melilla in the Copa del Rey.Madrid had briefed that they would bring the former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, whom they contacted over three weeks ago, but talks stalled on Monday. Although there is no definitive decision, there was little optimism that a deal would be done with the Italian. The reason for that is not yet clear but Madrid’s captain, Sergio Ramos, had made it clear that he did not welcome the prospect. Asked about the prospect of a manager like Conte with mano dura – an iron fist – arriving at the Bernabéu, Ramos replied: “Respect is earned, not imposed.”Although he did not name them, Ramos clearly referred to Vicente del Bosque, Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane, none of whom is authoritarian and who all had a close relationship with the squad, when he added: “We have had success with coaches that I don’t need to name but you all know. Sometimes knowing how to manage a dressing room is more important than technical ability.”Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez, believes he needs a manager to lead a dressing room that has become too comfortable, but the prospect of conflict from the start is not one that Conte can have relished.One of the criticisms Pérez levelled at Lopetegui was that he was too indulgent of the squad and he rapidly lost faith in the coach – at least in part because he did not have much faith to start with. After Zidane announced his surprise resignation, Madrid sought to bring in a series of managers to take over, including Mauricio Pochettino and Max Allegri of Juventus, before eventually turning to Lopetegui in the face of extremely limited options. Few wanted to follow Zidane, winner of three Champions Leagues in a row. Some saw flaws in the squad, too – Zidane himself had warned of the need to make changes after a season in which, while they won the European Cup, they also finished third in La Liga, 17 points behind Barcelona.For Lopetegui the opportunity was one that he could not pass up – he did not think it would mean the chance to coach Spain at the World Cup would be denied him. He did not request that Madrid wait or that conversations be held with the Federation, whose president was furious when he was presented with a fait accompli.Lopetegui was unveiled at the Bernabéu the day after he had been sent home from Russia.“Yesterday the saddest day of my life today is the happiest,” he said. It would always be difficult to dissociate the two days: being Madrid manager was always likely to be tinged with some regret, even if he was successful. Although Madrid started the league season brightly and were impressive in their Champions League debut against Roma, results soon deserted them. Lopetegui lamented injuries and bad luck, but that excuse did not convince.He was careful not to publicly challenge decisions made at boardroom level but with Neymar the only player Madrid were prepared to spend big on and the market shifting, the squad has got weaker over the last three years. That morning, El Mundo published an interview with Lopetegui’s elderly father in which he complained “they have taken fifty goals off” his son, with the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo.Pérez was also unhappy that there was no place for 18-year-old Brazilian signing Vinicius, who Lopetegui left in the B team. The club’s legal staff managed to get a ban overturned following a red card playing for Castilla last weekend, freeing Vinicius to play the clásico on Sunday. He travelled with the team, missing the Castilla game, but Lopetegui left him out of the matchday squad.The manager’s position had already become all-but untenable. The clásico might have been an opportunity to avoid the inevitable, and some players expressed their support, but Madrid were defeated 5-1 and slipped seven points behind their rivals. “I know how football is,” he said afterwards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d045e9fdeb4e5ede30427a554142ae316c48e31f/837_146_1530_918/master/1530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bf418548b5e9f0084c9d5e0ec3c2d37","title":"dele alli signs new six year tottenham contract football","story":"Dele Alli has signed a new six-year contract at Tottenham, tying him to the club until 2024. The 22-year-old attacking midfielder has been in negotiations over fresh terms for some time and he has now followed the manager, Mauricio Pochettino, and a clutch of players, chief among them Harry Kane, in making a major commitment.Pochettino, who is being linked to Real Madrid, agreed a five-year extension last May and the club shattered their wage structure with Kane’s six-year £200,000-a-week deal in June. Érik Lamela, Son Heung-min and Davinson Sánchez also signed new contracts over the summer and the club hope that Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen will soon follow suit.Vertonghen’s deal expires at the end of the season, although Spurs have the option to extend it by one year, while Eriksen is contracted to 2020.Alli’s news comes as a boost after a difficult few days for Tottenham, which has seen them announce that they will not move into their rebuilt stadium until January at the earliest, Pochettino declare he has never felt unhappier at the club and the team lose 1-0 to Manchester City at Wembley on Monday night.The stadium project continues to cast long shadows. The club have said they have arranged to borrow a further £237m from their banking partners – previously, their loan facility stood at £400m – in order to cover the spiralling costs, which are now understood to have topped £1bn.Alli returned from a hamstring injury against City as a substitute and he is in line to start the Carabao Cup tie at West Ham on Wednesday night.

So no real change there on a strange night when Manchester City eked out a brittle, angsty 1-0 win against a brittle, angsty Tottenham team in front of a brittle, angsty Tottenham crowd.It is hard to think of many stranger Premier League fixtures than this, though this 1-0 victory for the champions was strange in an understated, slightly dreamy kind of way. For most of the first half it was almost impossible to look past the wretched spectacle of the Wembley pitch, heavily scarred by the markings of the NFL game on Sunday night and appearing here like a jilted bride in its faded Super Bowl suit, still mourning that scuppered elopement with the man from the Jacksonville Jaguars.The ground staff at Wembley should be applauded for their hard work in remedying this. To their credit the pitch played well. But it looked terrible. The Wembley centre circle was still home to a mockingly semi-erased NFL badge. The yard-markers from 50 to 10 were confusingly visible. On the near side a brown trench ran the length of the pitch with the word LONDON emblazoned in green relief, like the logo on the hem of a cheap pair of pants. Otherwise the surface looked drawn and haggard, a pitch still coming down from the night before the night before, with lines and cracks and stubbly patches peeking through.Perhaps unsurprisingly City and Spurs produced an odd, half‑and‑half performance. City never really looked like losing, even as they were cut open regularly on the left, Benjamin Mendy scampering up and down his flank like a startled kitten.City were also sublime in attack at times, the short-range combinations between David Silva, Riyad Mahrez and Bernardo Silva so soft and sinuous they should probably have been pixelated out in the name of decency or subject to a tactful cut away by the TV director.In the middle of all this it was Sterling who provided a note of hard-running certainty. It is still easy to underestimate what City’s most prosaic, no-frills attacker offers to this team of artists. It was Sterling’s direct running in the sixth minute that made the only goal, initiated by Ederson’s hard, flat forward pass.With the ball at his feet City’s keeper saw Sterling split left from the snap and sent the ball long. Kieran Trippier could only flick it on back towards his own goal. Sterling carried the play into his own favourite little hot spot by the intersection of six-yard box and touchline, then cut back for Riyad Mahrez, arriving late in the end zone, to ease the ball into an unguarded net.It was a wonderfully simple, well‑executed goal. But then Sterling is a hugely effective Premier League player now, reward for his own hard work with Pep Guardiola and for a clarity in his attacking intentions. He has become a pared back inside forward, operating in the same channels, with the same range of movements and with a brutal repetitiveness. It works. The assist for the goal was Sterling’s third of the season to go with four goals in eight league games.It was also a welcome element of certainty on a night when both teams looked spooked at times. The Mendy-Sissoko channel in particular was home to some slapstick moments. Look, there goes Mendy again, caught 40 yards upfield, haring back frantically like a man fleeing a pack of wild dogs. But wait, here’s Sissoko to punt the ball blindly out of play, each time looking utterly stunned, as though only then rediscovering that, yes, he really is still Moussa Sissoko.It was further forward on City’s flanks that the best football of the game was played. Mahrez always seemed to be free, jinking always to his left, a jink so well advertised one half expected it to pop up on the scrolling boards at the side of the pitch in shiny flashing text, but which somehow nobody ever really seems to expect.With Sterling on the other side City always carried a threat, even on a night that will be remembered more for the oddity of its staging. At the end there was a reassuringly warm quality to the cheers from the City fans, and an unusual energy to the backslaps among Guardiola’s staff. City have now travelled to Arsenal, Liverpool and Spurs, keeping three clean sheets and taking seven points. They were lucky not to concede, rescued by Ederson in the first half, and by Erik Lamela’s ham-footed finish in the second. But this was just a game to win, a strange night on a weird pitch, decided by a moment of prosaic incision from City’s own local boy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cfdf4b066198bf5f6b16f3672642dee82e91210/107_406_735_441/master/735.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f048e77390e5b9c9426e5604a850f5af","title":"five scenic uk cycle routes for beginners","story":"Cycling doesn’t have to be all about endurance, speed and derring-do – it’s also an activity that can be relaxing and even meditative. These five routes are perfect for those looking to take on longer rides at a gentler paceMore and more people are rediscovering cycling as a gentle way to exercise and explore new places on their own steam. Cycling lets us experience our surroundings in new ways – from the sights and smells we might miss in the car, to the simple pleasure of feeling the wind in our hair. It’s also something just about anyone can enjoy: cycling is non-weight bearing, and for many people it’s easier than walking. There are also bikes to suit most needs. With some great, flat, traffic-free or low-traffic routes across the UK that you can enjoy at a gentle pace, inspiration and adventure are just around the corner.Distance: 18 milesStart: PadstowEnd: Wenford BridgeTime taken to cycle: one-and-a-half to two hours without stopsThe Camel Trail is one of the UK’s best-loved cycle trails, not least with families, for its beautiful waterside scenery and wealth of wildlife. From picturesque Padstow it follows the Camel estuary’s shore, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and home to little egrets, peregrines, ospreys and kingfishers. The delightful riveted Little Petherick creek bridge once served the former railway line. After an on-road section through Wadebridge it wends through wooded country beside the River Camel, past Bodmin, before briefly skirting Bodmin Moor, to Wenford Bridge.Pit stopTreats on Trikes is a traditional tea, cake and ice cream vendor on a tricycle, midway between Padstow and Wadebridge, at Penquean quarry.Distance: 13 milesStart: Sirhowy valley country parkEnd: Taff Bargoed parkTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours without stopsExplore three south Wales valleys parks by bike. Starting at Sirhowy valley country park, north-west of Newport, you’ll follow a former railway line over the listed Hengoed viaduct, with its 16 towering arches, and past the Wheel o Drams, an 8-metre tall circular sculpture of mining carts. Penallta country park once housed the deepest pit in the south Wales coalfields, and now features viewpoints, wetlands, and the UK’s largest earth sculpture – Sultan the Pit Pony (above, top left). You’ll finish in Taff Bargoed park, once three pits, and now a wildlife haven perfect for a riverside picnic.

No wonder the fitness world loves itIf you have an injury or health condition, consult your doctor before doing these exercisesIt doesn’t take much time to improve your health. HIIT has become a staple in the fitness world and for good reason: it’s the time-efficient, super-effective way to get fitter that’s backed by science.But it doesn’t always have to mean donning your lycra – in fact, research shows that as little as a minute of HIIT can benefit the body. The workouts below take two minutes each, one for each hour of your working day. They target every muscle group in the body, require no equipment and can be done in very little space.The benefits? You’ll boost your circulation and energy levels every hour, so no more wanting to sleep face down on your keyboard it will increase your cardio fitness, muscle strength and core stability, and you’ll continue to burn calories even after you’re back at your desk!Before doing each workout, warm up by gently jogging on the spot for 30 seconds and then standing and raising one knee at a time in front of you – 10 on each leg. Work as hard as you can for the 20-second bursts of exercise. At the end of the workout, pace around for 30 seconds to cool down and stretch out any muscles that feel tight.Each workout follows the same pattern: do the first three exercises for 20 seconds each, with 10 seconds of rest in between each one. Do the fourth exercise for 30 seconds:Plank Lie on your front, hands beneath your shoulders, elbows pointing back. Tuck your toes under and push yourself up until your arms are straight, pulling your navel up towards your spine so you feel the core stability muscles around your middle engage. Keep looking at the floor and make sure your bottom is neither sagging towards the floor nor pushing up towards the ceiling.Press-ups From a plank position, bend your elbows to lower yourself towards the floor. Letting your elbows flare out to the side works the chest harder keeping them nearer your sides focuses more on the triceps. A full-press up is touching your nose almost to the ground, but you may not get that far to start with. The most important thing is to keep a straight line from your knees, to hips, to head. Balance on your knees rather than your feet to make it easier if needed.Jumping jacksStand with feet together and hands by your sides. Simultaneously, jump your feet out sideways and swing your arms out to the side and up until your fingertips meet above your head. Jump back to starting position.Bottom kicksJog on the spot, flicking your heels up to kick your bottom.High kneesJog on the spot while bringing your knees up high in front of you. Use your arms to really drive the movement and go as fast as you can. If this is too vigorous for you, do the same action but as though you’re walking rather than running.Mountain climbersFrom a plank position, lift your right foot off the floor and drive the knee towards your chest. Place the foot back and repeat with your left knee. Don’t stick your bottom high in the air and keep a rapid flow.Shadow boxStand with feet hip-width apart and bring fists up into a boxing position. Punch upwards with the right hand then the left, then punch across your body with your right hand then left, allowing your body to rotate towards the direction of the punch and heel to come off the floor.Bear crawlKneel on all fours, hands directly under your shoulders, knees under your hips. Tuck your toes under and lift your knees to hover a few inches above the ground. Now crawl forwards – right arm at same time as left leg and vice versa – for six paces, then crawl backwards for six. Keep your abdominals engaged and back as flat as possible (imagine you’re balancing something on it).Reverse lungesStand with feet hip-width apart. Step back with your left foot, lowering the front knee to a right angle or deeper. Focus on using the glute in your right buttock to power back up to standing. Repeat with the right leg.Sumo squatsStand with feet wide apart, toes turned slightly out (about 45-degree angle), hands clasped in front of your chest. Keeping your back straight, bend your knees in the direction of your toes (but don’t go beyond them) to lower yourself until your knees are as near to 90 degrees as possible. Keep your weight in your heels. Come back to standing.Squats or jump squatsStand with feet just wider than hip-width apart. Cross your arms and place your hands on opposite shoulders. Keeping your torso upright and chest facing forward, bend your knees and stick your bottom out, spread your weight through your heels and ensure that your knees don’t stick out beyond the end of your toes. For a full squat, you’re aiming to lower your bottom to knee height while keeping your chest facing forward, but go as far as is comfortable. Return to standing. To make squats harder, add in a little jump at the top of the move.Bicycle crunchesLie on your back with feet flat on the floor, hands touching your ears, elbows out to the side. Simultaneously, lift your feet and head off the floor and begin to slowly move your legs in a pedalling motion. As your right knee comes towards you, bring your left elbow towards it and vice versa with the left knee and right elbow. Keep your torso still by engaging your core stability muscles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46bde53bfab45f752f0423461a10de1c7b166975/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93f40f06a7976a63d80404621f00899d","title":"nine simple ways to revamp your workspace for a healthier environment","story":"Improving your posture at work, adding some greenery to your desk and moving to a window seat are just some of the quick fixes that can transform your productivityThere’s a lot more to happiness in the workplace than a comfortable salary. In fact, working more than 40 hours a week may well be doing you a considerable disservice and directly affecting your health and performance at work. Thankfully, taking a few minutes of your day and deploying intelligent fixes can turn your office from a dreary workspace to an area that transforms your productivity and mindset. Here are nine ways you can make your office work for you.Take a standThere’s a reason standing desks – no longer the reserve of agile Silicon Roundabout startups – are quickly making their way into the offices of multinationals. Encouraging employees to be considerably more aware of their posture at work, adjustable desks and workstations such as Varidesk and the Yo-Yo desk are quickly becoming adopted by offices across the UK. What’s more, sitting for more than six hours a day leaves you at greater risk of anxiety and depression, according to the Association for Psychological Science – meaning that an eight-hour day spent on your rear quickly becomes an unhealthy habit.Spring cleaningOld meeting notes, dirty mugs, empty sandwich boxes and a dirty keyboard all add up to an unhappy desk. According to a study by Princeton Neuroscience Institute, “multiple visual stimuli” – also known as unwelcome desk clutter – compete for attention in your brain, meaning you can remove distraction with a desk free of unnecessary mess. Similarly, you’ll want to give your keyboard a wipe-down every week or so, as the average keyboard has 20,000 times more bacteria than a toilet seat.Stretch it outStressful experiences – at work and at home – have the potential to age the human brain by four years, according to a 2017 study presented at the Alzheimer’s Association’s conference. Thankfully, you can de-stress and fight poor posture at your desk by working through this stretching routine. To open up your back, bring your hands behind you and press your palms together. Bring your elbows back and downwards, slowly tucking your chin – hold the stretch for 30 seconds and repeat three times. Consider this your first step to become a more supple – and pain-free – human.Make a moveFor now, there are no stringent laws on taking screen breaks, but the Health and Safety Executive recommends a five- to 10-minute break every hour. Standing up and walking around will help stretch your body, adjust your posture and increase productivity and attention, as well as the quality of your work.Give yourself a handSpending 35-plus hours at a desk each week is hardly appealing, the very real prospect of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) – a condition in which a nerve in your wrist is under pressure, causing numb hands, weakness and tingling – is far worse. Common in men and women over 40 years old, CTS stems from repetitive actions such as using a mouse and keyboard. Handily, ergonomic office equipment – Microsoft Surface and Mac-friendly Kinesis Freestyle are two of the UK’s most popular options – can help stave CTS off. The oddly shaped equipment improves forearm posture, adds comfort and supports your hands. You’ll agree that it’ll be worth a few odd looks.Thirsty workWorkplace absence in the UK is costing £18bn annually, according to analysis from Centre of Economic and Business Research. That’s a total of 168m working days lost annually. While there’s no sole reason for this, it’s important to adopt everyday habits to keep you as healthy as possible in the workplace. Dehydration, for example, even at a mild level, directly affects both physical and mental performance, meaning that you’ll find it hard to concentrate during work hours and struggle with that post-work run. Women should aim for two litres a day, and men for three litres.Light workIf constantly feeling tired is making office life a miserable reality, it could be because of the light levels in your office. A 2013 study from the Netherlands found that when office workers were exposed to more daylight during the working week, they were less sleepy and considerably more energetic. Similarly, researchers from Turkey found that study participants who had three hours or more of daylight a day felt considerably happier and more satisfied – muting the chance of office burnout. Push for that window desk and reap the rewards immediately.Pain in the neckYour career, rather unfortunately, is wreaking havoc on your neck. A combination of poor posture and stress, which affects your sleep, is likely to be causing unnecessary neck pain. Rarely a sign of something more serious, neck pain can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers such as Voltarol, which can be taken orally or applied directly to the affected area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e374bbe7ae12d8bf61c36ced0b7dc0ef42c073a/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=379da1d57b2f5fc77aae57d19c82906b","title":"has destiny 2 forsaken expansion revitalised space opera game bungie","story":"Bungie’s billion-dollar shooter game is winning back players by investing its alien prey with personality – and providing plenty to do when the gunfire stopsThe difficulty with games such as Destiny – continually evolving online worlds and communities with whims that change week on week – is that you never really know how well those changes have worked out until some time down the line. Destiny 2’s Forsaken expansion came out last month, bringing with it new modes and features intended to win back players who felt the game had become facile and too predictable. It’s now enjoying an excellent Halloween-themed seasonal event, the Festival of the Lost.The third expansion pack to the first sequel of a billion-dollar game is an odd place to rip up the rule book and start afresh. But time and again, that’s what Destiny 2: Forsaken does, and as a result Destiny has never been stronger.The most obvious beneficiary of the fresh start is the new campaign mode, which sees the player’s  avenging the murder of Nathan Fillion’s love-him-or-hate-him wisecracking robot Cayde-6. The ensuing quest for vengeance takes the player to two new areas, the Tangled Shore and the Dreaming City, as they wreak frontier justice on murderer Uldren Sov and his henchmen, the Barons.This is, largely, portrayed through the medium of shooting aliens in the head with extremely satisfying sci-fi guns, of which developer Bungie is still the undisputed master crafter. A bow, handed to the player early on, is such fun to fire it feels almost unfair to the other weapons in the game.Tonally, structurally and thematically, Forsaken consciously forges a different path from its predecessors. It (mostly) eschews sci-fi nonsense about space wizards for a clearer story about a quest for justice, delivered to the player in a less railroaded fashion than previous games, and with a newfound aspect of moral uncertainty to it. For a series that is basically about space zombies committing quadruple xenocide because their god, a giant marble, upset four alien species at once, it’s refreshing to see even a hint of something other than pure Starship Troopers-level devotion to the cause.Even the aliens have personalities now. They are inidually voice-acted and characterised with backstories. An interlude where one alien explains the pet peeves of another eight perhaps goes a bit too far in hammering that difference home, but the effort is appreciated.Of course, a game like Destiny isn’t really about the campaign. It’s about what comes next. When Destiny 2 launched last year, this was where the fall came at the end of a fun, focused and comprehensible campaign, players emerged into the light to find … not much to do. A conscious effort by Bungie to tone down the first game’s slot-machine approach to loot instead left many feeling like they were simply being told to stop playing – and they did.So Bungie recanted. Now, there’s a surfeit of activities, with daily and weekly milestones sitting on top of, by my count, at least 20 different currencies to collect, as well as the same loot hunt that has powered the core game throughout. But this panoply of activities is a mixed blessing: while it never hits the same level of grind that the very first game did, if you have a problem with compulsive playing, be aware that Forsaken is not a game that you will ever finish. The list of activities to be completed grows as quickly as they’re checked off, and knowing when to stop is an exercise left up to the players themselves. The downside of the bounty system, meanwhile, is that every session begins with 20 minutes of running around getting missions before anyone can actually play.Luckily, it’s fun. With the Dreaming City, a whole second area set aside for the end-game, Forsaken avoids the trap of simply asking players to redo levels they’ve already played, while the traditional assortment of co-operative Strikes, competitive Crucible matches, and open world Flashpoints provides a varied assortment of activities to hold your attention.Those are bolstered by the best addition to the game, the “coopetitive” – cooperatively competitive – Gambit. Maybe it’s a function of Bungie’s development schedule, but where competitors are borrowing from the Battle Royale craze, Bungie seems to have looked to games such as Dota 2 for inspiration: Gambit pits two teams of four against each other in a race to kill the most aliens possible, periodically invading each other’s arenas to complicate matters. It’s hugely entertaining, allowing for Bungie’s world-class shooting-aliens-in-the-head expertise to be put to good use in a more competitive setting, outside the tense and twitchy head-to-heads of the Crucible mode.Bungie knows it has a winner on its hands, already earmarking Gambit mode – and its in-game personification, the drifter – for a starring role in one of the three mini-expansions coming over the next year. The existence of those expansions, sold in a bundle as part of an “annual pass”, has been the source of some grumbling from the community, but going by the first month of the game’s life, Bungie finally seems to be grasping what it means to keep a live game… alive.Already, players have seen the Dreaming City blossom and collapse, they’ve been given time-limited dungeons and expansive quest lines, and they’ve been mining the game’s lore for hints about what’s to come. The price – £79.98 for the base game, the expansion and the annual pass – is a lot of money, but if you’re so inclined, it could easily be your last video game expenditure until September 2019, when the next instalment is expected. There’s just that much stuff here.There’s still more stuff that could have been ripped up. Almost every character carried over from the first game is a wooden enigma with whom no human could empathise the four basic alien races, known to players for years, are getting stale and the six-person raids, the star attraction of the end-game, are still too hard for casual players to experience.But Forsaken shows that destruction is accompanied by rebirth, and for the first time in years, I can say that Destiny is a game you should play."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0309fd5f17da3e6bf851b315284fbfac75860e6/21_72_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4572b8de6f241da0acdecb8cf8ca8c38","title":"saudis demanded good publicity over yemen aid leaked un document shows","story":"The UN aid agency, Ocha, was pushed to accept extensive terms attached to $930m from Saudi Arabia and UAESaudi Arabia has demanded that aid agencies operating in Yemen should provide favourable publicity for Riyadh’s role in providing $930m (£725m) of humanitarian aid, an internal UN document reveals.Saudi military intervention in the three-year civil war is widely regarded as a prime cause of the humanitarian disaster that has seen 10,000 civilians killed, and left millions close to starvation. The kingdom intervened in Yemen to restore a UN-recognised government, and push back Iranian-supported Houthi rebels.Although many donors seek publicity in return for grants, the extent of the Saudi demands are highly unusual.The document, entitled Visibility Plan, covers the terms of the 2018 humanitarian budget for Yemen, and shows the extent to which the UN aid agency, Ocha, was put under pressure to accept the PR strings attached to money given both by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The two countries provided nearly one third of the total UN humanitarian budget for Yemen for this year.Future grants distributed by Ocha to agencies should be tied to the amount of beneficial publicity given to Saudi Arabia, the documents advises. It also calls for Ocha to seek favourable publicity for the Saudi humanitarian effort in Yemen in newspapers such as the New York Times and the .The document also sets out how all agencies receiving Saudi aid must share a summary of their publicity around the funding. The agreement adds: “We consider it very important to ensure that our dear fellow Yemenis are all aware of our donations. More emphasis should be placed on strengthening the local visibility plan by engaging local media … so that donors get deserved recognition and not to be overshadowed by the recipient’s agencies’ visibility.”The UN, the plan sets out, will convene events at UN headquarters focusing on the humanitarian response in Yemen, and the impact of all donor funding. These events will acknowledge the roles of all donors including Saudi Arabia and the UAE.The agreement also requires agencies receiving the aid to document Saudi- and UAE-supported activities in photographs and video material in Yemen.The document then sets out 48 specific steps UN agencies have agreed to take this year to publicise Saudi activity covering five different UN aid-linked agencies, including the UN Development Programme, Ocha, the World Health Organization and Unicef.The leaked documents also show the pressure the two countries have brought to bear on the UN to raise their profile as charitable donors.Although the documents show that Ocha resisted some of the Saudi demands, the agency complied with a Saudi request that “a specialised person is recruited by Ocha to be the focal point to ensure the implementation plan by all recipient agencies and to consolidate reports”.Ocha said in a statement: “Most of the donors in Yemen and elsewhere have visibility requirements that are agreed bilaterally with the inidual donor. Because they are bilateral agreements, we do not discuss the details of the inidual agreements in public … Throughout the conflict in Yemen, the UN has been vocal, consistent and public in its call on all parties to the conflict to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law, including the obligation to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure. We will continue to do so.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62b845bdeb714352a4e984dcf30eec572f904d20/0_63_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4deae035f10ad1f87a85a1327fe3e492","title":"uk exaggerated number of lives saved by maternal health aid project","story":"Watchdog says many more deaths could have been prevented given level of investment in Department for International Development programmesThe UK government has been criticised by an aid watchdog for exaggerating the number of women’s lives it saved through its maternal health programmes.A review, published by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai) on Tuesday, also said the number of lives saved “were significantly below what they could have been, given the level of investment”.The watchdog said programmes by Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID) had failed to significantly improve the quality and sustainability of maternal healthcare services in partner countries.DfID spent about £4.6bn on programmes in health and other sectors between 2011 and 2015. Within this, £1.3bn focused more closely on maternal health, including family planning, reproductive healthcare and maternal and neonatal health. But Icai said investments were focused on short-term goals, and did not do enough to strengthen healthcare systems or target marginalised women or teenage girls.By 2015, DfID claimed to have saved 103,000 women’s lives during pregnancy and childbirth, more than double its goal of 50,000. In an internal and unpublished review, this figure was revised down to 80,100.Icai said the department relied on “unrealistic assumptions” to reach such figures. Compared with the review team’s observations in countries such as Malawi, the estimates appeared inflated.Alison Evans, Icai’s chief commissioner, who led the review, said UK aid had expanded access to family planning, but added “… given the ambition, need and level of investment, the programmes fell short of what was required to achieve adequate progress.”Health facilities in partner countries remained chronically under-resourced, with severe shortages of beds, healthcare workers and equipment, said Evans. In northern Malawi, an area visited as part of the review, heavily pregnant women camped outside health facilities for up to a month before giving birth.“They are waiting because they are not sure where they are in their pregnancy cycle because of the lack of ultrasound equipment and the lack of effective dating of pregnancies,” she said. “They don’t know how close to their due dates they are and because they are fearful of giving birth in a situation where there may not be a skilled attendant they wait outside facilities, sometimes for up to a month, sometimes in makeshift accommodation.”UK aid programmes had fallen short of targets to improve emergency obstetric and neonatal care, according to the review.It also failed to include measures that would tackle discrimination and abuse of women in health facilities.Sean Roberts, policy and campaigns officer at Health Poverty Action, said UK aid must be better targeted at the most vulnerable groups. “Indigenous women die far more often in childbirth than other women,” he said. “If DfID wants to meet its commitment to leave no one behind it must implement a robust action plan to address the maternal health of indigenous women and other excluded groups.”While UK aid had improved access to family planning for millions of women, in Malawi such programmes were delivered through non-state providers. Such partnerships allowed funding to quickly reach large numbers of people, but risked displacing public sector services, said Evans.“You have this problem of sustainability,” she said. “The public sector is not able to gear itself up to provide a similar level of outreach.”The review team visited a sample of programmes in Malawi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as analysing published literature, DfID policy documents and conducting interviews with experts.Icai warned that health facilities struggled to ensure a reliable supply of contraceptives. It added that DfID had championed reproductive rights at the international level, but done less work to encourage legal, policy and cultural change in partner countries.DfID said in a statement that the UK is a global leader in promoting reproductive health, and added that the review was not representative of all the department’s work.“We welcome Icai’s acknowledgement that UK aid is helping women around the world access the life-saving services they need, but it is disappointing the report has made some generalisations from a selected portion of our programming and also does not fully reflect the full impact of our work, especially in recent years,” the statement said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f55d050dc41a41e43705c7996ec79aab4bb3e25/167_0_2225_1336/master/2225.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efbedd8b5f5724f5c27cd9e18440d6a6","title":"butter nonsense the rise of the cholesterol deniers","story":"A group of scientists has been challenging everything we know about cholesterol, saying we should eat fat and stop taking statins. This is not just bad science – it will cost lives, say expertsButter is back. Saturated fat is good for you. Cholesterol is not the cause of heart disease. Claims along these lines keep finding their way into newspapers and mainstream websites – even though they contradict decades of medical advice. There is a battle going on for our hearts and minds.According to a small group of dissident scientists, whose work usually first appears in minor medical journals, by far the greatest threat to our hearts and vascular systems comes from sugar, while saturated fat has been wrongly demonised. And because cholesterol levels don’t matter, they argue, we don’t need the statins that millions have been prescribed to lower them. A high-fat diet is the secret to a healthy life, they say. Enjoy your butter and other animal fats. Cheese is great. Meat is back on the menu.This is more than bad science, according to leading scientists and medical authorities. It will cost lives. “Encouraging people to eat more saturated fat is dangerous and irresponsible,” is a typical verdict, in this case from Prof Louis Levy, the head of nutrition science at Public Health England (PHE). “There is good evidence that a high intake of saturated fat increases your risk of heart disease. We need to think about where the sources of saturated fat are and how we can reduce them. The largest contributions are dairy products, including butter, and meat and meat products.”The advice from PHE, the World Health Organization, the British Heart Foundation (BHF), Heart UK and other institutions and top academics is consistent. Butter and cheese may be fine in modest amounts in a balanced diet, but the saturated fat that they contain is potentially risky. Too much of it causes the liver to overproduce “bad” LDL cholesterol, which is implicated in heart disease.Mainstream scientists usually keep their disquiet to themselves. But last week, some broke cover over what they see as one medical journal’s support for advocates of a high-fat diet. More than 170 academics signed a letter accusing the British Journal of Sports Medicine of bias, triggered by an opinion piece that it ran in April 2017 calling for changes to the public messaging on saturated fat and heart disease. Saturated fat “does not clog the arteries”, said the piece, which was not prompted by original research. “Coronary artery disease is a chronic inflammatory disease and it can be reduced effectively by walking 22 minutes a day and eating real food,” wrote the cardiologist Aseem Malhotra and colleagues. The BHF criticised the claims as “misleading and wrong”.David Nunan, from Oxford University’s centre for evidence-based medicine, and three colleagues wrote a rebuttal that the journal at first did not use and then, more than a year later, put behind a paywall, while the original article was free. Last week’s letter of complaint asked Dr Fiona Godlee, the editor-in-chief of the BMJ, which publishes the British Journal of Sports Medicine, to intervene, saying the journal had run 10 pieces advocating low-carb diets and criticising statins in the past three years and that the reluctance to run the rebuttal showed a bias and lack of transparency. She replied defending the journal’s right to challenge “the status quo in some settings”, but allowed free access to the rebuttal.Every time a new review or opinion is published in an obscure or unlikely journal – sports medicine is, after all, primarily about helping the fit get even fitter – it is picked up by newspapers that know statin scares sell. Very often in the UK they quote Malhotra, a charming and telegenic young cardiologist in private practice whose website describes him as “one of the most influential and effective campaigning doctors in the world on issues that affect obesity, heart disease and population health”. He is, it says, “not just a cardiologist. This is a man who wants to change the world one meal at a time by not just rocking the system but by rebuilding it.”Malhotra urges a low-carb, high-fat diet. His book, The Pioppi Diet, has the distinction of being named by the British Dietetic Association as one of the five worst “celeb” diet books in Britain – celebrities who have tried it include MPs Keith Vaz and Andy Burnham. It includes lots of fruit and vegetables, olive oil and fish, but otherwise “hijacks” the Mediterranean diet, says the BDA.“The authors may well be the only people in the history of the planet who have been to Italy and come back with a diet named after an Italian village that excludes pasta, rice and bread – but includes coconuts – perhaps because they have a low-carb agenda,” says the BDA. “The suggestion that this Italian village should be associated with recipes for cauliflower-base pizza and rice substitute made from grated cauliflower or anything made using coconut oil is ridiculous. It also uses potentially dangerous expressions like ‘clean meat’ and encourages people to starve themselves for 24 hours at a time every week.”He was accused by Prof Rory Collins at Oxford University of endangering lives. Collins said scare stories about statins could do as much harm as Andrew Wakefield did when he claimed that vaccines caused autism.When it comes to statins, there is a huge database of research. Since 1994, the Nuffield department of population health at Oxford University, led by two eminent epidemiologists, Collins and Prof Richard Peto, has been amassing and analysing the data in order to figure out how well they work in preventing heart attacks and strokes.They have published many papers. In 2016, in a major review in the Lancet, they concluded that lowering cholesterol over five years with a cheap daily statin would prevent 1,000 heart attacks, strokes and coronary artery bypasses among 10,000 people who had already had one. It would also prevent 500 in people who were at increased risk, for instance because of high blood pressure or diabetes.“Our review shows that the numbers of people who avoid heart attacks and strokes by taking statin therapy are very much larger than the numbers who have side-effects with it,” Collins said at the time. Most side-effects can be reversed by stopping the statin, he pointed out – but heart attacks cause permanent damage. “Consequently,” he said, “there is a serious cost to public health from making misleading claims about high side-effect rates that inappropriately dissuade people from taking statin therapy despite the proven benefits.”But the cholesterol sceptics and statins critics reject the evidence on the basis that the trial data is from big pharma and that the raw data is not in the public domain. Maryanne Demasi, a journalist in Australia whose TV programmes questioning statins were pulled from the ABC network because of concerns over impartiality, wrote in January – again in the British Journal of Sports Medicine – of a “crisis of confidence” in the public because “the raw data on the efficacy and safety of statins are being kept secret and have not been subjected to scrutiny by other scientists … Doctors and patients are being misled.”There were cholesterol sceptics before statins existed, doubting the hypothesis that high cholesterol in the blood, particularly in the form of LDL, furs up the arteries, leading in the worst cases to a blood clot that can trigger a heart attack or stroke. Yet, says Dermot Neely, a consultant in clinical biochemistry and metabolic medicine and a founder trustee of the Heart UK charity: “The cholesterol hypothesis is supported by a vast amount of scientific data.” Recently, an expert paper was published by the European Atherosclerosis Society summarising all the evidence, to try to silence the sceptics.But they won’t be silenced. A website called Thincs – The International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics – links to published and unpublished papers as well as the various books its members have written, including a joint one entitled Fat and Cholesterol Don’t Cause Heart Attacks. And Statins Are Not the Solution.”That is flat-earthism, says Collins. “The claims that blood LDL cholesterol levels are not causally related to cardiovascular disease (which is really in the same realm as claiming that smoking does not cause cancer) are factually false,” he maintains. He believes there is an argument for refusing to give cholesterol-deniers a platform, just as some will no longer debate with climate change sceptics.Neely says a lot of people ring the nurses and dieticians staffing the Heart UK helpline after reading such stories or hearing about them from family and friends. “We’re very concerned whenever these messages result in people stopping a statin that they were prescribed after their heart attack. Every time there has been a statin scare story in the papers, there is a wave of people who just stop picking up their prescriptions. And as a result of that, many will probably be readmitted with another heart attack down the line,” he says. Some of those are young people who have high cholesterol from birth because of a mutated gene. One of Neely’s patients is a young man whose grandfather and father died of heart attacks at 50. He is on a statin and will be the first in three generations to escape that fate, says Neely.Asked how he can be sure of his position when the vast majority of top research scientists disagree, Ravnskov says: “Because I am right. The reason why the so-called experts say that I am mistaken is that the vast majority are paid generously by the drug companies.” Asked to elaborate, since statins are out of patent and therefore no longer make money for the companies that originally put them on the market, he expounds on the corruption, illegal practices and wealth of pharmaceutical companies.The Oxford researchers, including Collins, have published their funding. The unit has research funds from pharmaceutical companies, but the iniduals do not take money from them. Ironically, say the researchers, if people refuse statins because of concerns over side-effects, they may be put on expensive newer drugs to lower their cholesterol – and this will make money for big pharma.That means statins are given to healthy people to prevent disease and side-effects have become a major issue. The stories are so widespread that people repeat them as if they are incontrovertible, yet the evidence from trials is that even the much-discussed muscle pain is rare. The sceptics dismiss that evidence. Those trials were funded by big pharma, they say, which had a vested interest in hiding any problems with the drugs.Some side-effects may be caused by interactions with other drugs people are on, such as antibiotics. But there is also evidence that some people get muscle pain because they expect to after everything they have heard. It is called the nocebo effect.The dissidents’ arguments are attractively simple. Eat fat, avoid carbs and don’t take the tablets, says Malhotra – who declined to answer questions for this article. We would probably all agree that we should ditch junk food and eat well instead of taking pills. But, realistically, telling people to “eat good food” isn’t going to cut it. The majority of people in the UK and the US are now overweight or obese, with all the heart and vascular problems that brings, and the trend is ever upwards.One thing is for sure – the dissidents are not going to shut up shop. “My belief about the cholesterol sceptics is that they are a bit like religious fundamentalists,” said Neely. “They are not open to argument. Whatever argument you present, they will find another argument because this basically defines who they are.” He cites a cardiologist in the 1980s, Prof Michael Oliver, who was a sceptic of the cholesterol hypothesis that more LDL increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Oliver did a U-turn as more evidence accumulated, saying: “When the facts change, I change my mind.” But, says Neely, “unfortunately the cholesterol sceptics we know currently don’t do that”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5f716d56fad58c9dd33136c6e2ab23703beb93/0_215_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fed8482a4fcac14d49b79093cc6e069e","title":"assange must follow new ecuador embassy rules says judge","story":"WikiLeaks founder claims regulations are bid to coerce him into ending asylumA judge in Ecuador has ruled against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, rejecting his request to loosen new requirements that he says are meant to push him into leaving his asylum in the country’s embassy in London.The judge, Karina Martínez, found that stricter rules recently imposed by the South American nation’s embassy – such as requiring Assange to pay for his internet and clean up after his cat – do not violate his asylum rights because authorities have the right to decide what is and isn’t allowed inside the building.Ecuadorian officials praised the ruling in the latest row between the Australian hacker and the government that has given him refuge for six years. Relations between Assange and Ecuador have grown increasingly prickly as the years have dragged on, with no resolution in sight.Assange’s lawyer vowed to appeal against the decision. “The Ecuadorian state has an international responsibility to protect Mr Assange,” attorney Carlos Poveda said.Assange argued that the new measures, which make it more difficult for him to receive visitors and requiring him to pay for services such as laundry and medical bills, are meant to coerce him into ending his asylum. Ecuador’s government contended that the requirements were aimed at peaceful cohabitation in tight quarters in the small embassy, where Assange takes up more than a third of the space. Officials have complained that his soccer playing and skateboarding have damaged the building.“It’s clear this protocol was issued with strict respect for international law,” Jose Valencia, Ecuador’s foreign minister, said after the ruling.Ecuador granted Assange asylum in the embassy in 2012 as he tried to avoid extradition to Sweden. Sweden’s top prosecutor later dropped a long-running inquiry into a rape allegation against him, saying there was no way to detain or charge him because of his protected status in the embassy.Nonetheless, Assange remains wanted in Britain for jumping bail, and he also fears a possible extradition to the US based on his leaking of classified state department documents.Assange initially enjoyed a cosy relationship with the then Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa, but relations with his host nation have steadily deteriorated. The current president, Lenín Moreno, has warned him not to meddle in matters that could jeopardise Ecuador’s foreign relations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15c5390caf98bfbdb72cda30446cc5147ec06063/0_0_1824_1094/master/1824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49725b53b5502cb69d832a30cfa3c0f8","title":"budget 2018 what it means for you","story":"We’ve looked at the figures to see how Philip Hammond’s budget will affect your finances – whether you’re single, married, with or without children or retired•Read all our budget coverage in fullAll figures supplied by Turquoise Training \u0026amp Consultancy (some have been rounded to nearest pound).Married couple with two sons aged 16 and 13. £16k, £24k2018-19 They pay combined annual income tax of £3,256 and national insurance of £2,778.

We have been living in my parents’ home for about a year and it has been working really well. They are able to help with childcare and they enjoy having me and the children around. The house is large enough for us all and still offers personal space when needed.My former home is now sold, and as a single mum I think I will struggle to buy a property in the same area as my parents as it is quite affluent and prices are rising rapidly. I will end up with about £35,000 from the sale of my property and I want to make the best of it. My parents and I have come up with a (potentially crazy) idea of me staying long term and mortgaging a small amount to buy a\u0026nbspshare of their property at market value.Would this be possible? They still have a small amount of mortgage on the property and the idea being that they could pay off the remaining amount and some of their debt which would enable my mum to retire (dad is already retired) and help with the childcare (saving me nursery fees). Additionally would there be scope for me to then use my £35,000 from the sale of my property as a deposit on a buy-to-let mortgage for another small property which\u0026nbspI could rent out and let itself “tick over” so to speak as means of investment. But is doing all that a bit too good to be true?FNA It is all a bit too good to be true, I’m afraid. To buy a share in your parents’ house, you either need to pay them cash for whatever percentage share you agree or get their lender’s agreement to be put on their existing mortgage and also get a solicitor to arrange what’s called a “transfer of equity” to ensure that you are listed as a joint owner at the Land Registry. If the transfer of equity was worth more than £40,000 there would also be stamp duty land tax (SDLT) to pay. It isn’t possible to take out a mortgage on your parents’ property on your own and separate from their mortgage.Being added to your parents’ mortgage\u0026nbsp– if their lender permits this\u0026nbsp– doesn’t get the mortgage paid off, however.

The Conservative MP Nick Boles, a remain-voting ally of Michael Gove’s, has been championing the idea, and the leading Brexiter Frank Field recently came out in favour in a  article.But this morning, in Norway, Theresa May rejected the idea, as Sky’s Faisal Islam reports.And even the Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, expressed doubts.Speaking in Norway at the Northern Future Forum event this morning, Theresa May praised the budget. She said:Austerity coming to an end isn’t just about more money into our public services, it’s about more money in people’s pockets as well. Yesterday, we confirmed that announcement that we had made in the summer of giving the biggest single injection of extra money into our National Health Service in its history. When we first said it in the summer we suggested we might have to raise taxes, we would have to raise taxes, to fund part of that. What was clear in the budget yesterday is we have fully funded that ... extra money into our NHS and not raising taxes. Indeed, we have cut taxes for 32m people.The local newspapers namechecked by Philip Hammond in yesterday’s budget have declined to endorse his proposals.The chancellor used his speech to announce an extension of the £1,500 discount on business rates for local news outlets, telling the House of Commons that “whatever the national press says, I’ve been assured a warm welcome for my budget from the Royston Crow and the Keswick Reminder”.Keswick Reminder editor Jane Grave was baffled when the  told her that her publication had been mentioned by Hammond: “I didn’t even know he knew he knew who we were”.Her newspaper, which doesn’t have a website and hasn’t updated its Twitter feed in over a year, sells 3,600 copies a week with a distribution area stretching across the northern Lake District from Keswick to Cockermouth and Wigton.Grave emphasised that her paper, produced with an editorial staff of four and no sales department, is “very non-political” but appeared to give a tacit welcome to the chancellor’s other big announcement – an increased taxes on major tech companies: “When you see the online companies not having to pay their taxes, that seems unfair.”Nick Gill, the editor of the Royston Crow, the other publication namechecked by Hammond, also defended its political neutrality and said the outlet “wouldn’t be endorsing – nor lambasting – Mr Hammond’s budget”.“Instead, we will leave it to our readers to decide whether this is a good Autumn Budget for residents and businesses in the North Herts and South Cambs area.”Men will benefit more from yesterday’s budget than women, according to an analysis commissioned by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper. Cooper has asked House of Commons library statisticians to develop a methodology for assessing the gender impact of budget measures and in the past she has published figures showing that women have lost disproportionately far more than men from the tax and benefit measures introduced since 2010. That research has been updated overnight, and it shows that yesterday’s budget also favoured men.Women are more likely to be hit by welfare cuts including universal credit whilst men are more likely to gain from the increased tax allowances. The chancellor’s decision to cut taxes for those on £100,000 a year helps more men, when he could have done more to sort out the problems with universal credit and the welfare system for families in poverty instead.In the centenary year of the first women getting the vote, it is shocking that the Treasury still refuses to carry out its own gender audit of the impact of its policies.This table has the latest figures. Negative figures indicate spending (a loss to the Treasury), and this analysis suggests that men will gain £2bn from the measures in the budget, while women will get £1.6bn.Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester and Jeremy Corbyn’s main rival in the 2015 Labour leadership contest, has criticised John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, for saying Labour would accept the income tax cuts announced in the budget yesterday. (See 10.13am.)At the news conference at the end of the Northern Future Forum meeting in Oslo Theresa May said the government was not planning an early election. She said:We are not preparing for another general elections. It wouldn’t be in the national interest.Given that May repeatedly said she was not planning an election before she announced one in 2017, her assurances on this topic are not seen as especially reliable.It is worth pointing out that no one thinks she is enthusiastic about an election. Instead, there is speculation that she could be forced into holding an election in the event of parliament voting against her Brexit deal - not something she thinks is ‘in the national interest”, but a possibility nevertheless.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has also been giving interviews this morning. Asked if he would reverse the tax cuts announced by the government yesterday, he said Labour would maintain them. He told Today:We will support the tax cuts at the moment on the basis that it will inject some demand into the economy. What we’ve said is we will leave those personal allowances at whatever we inherit but our focus will be on a fair taxation system.Normally what the opposition says about government tax plans more than three years away from the next general election is relatively academic, but with people speculating about a Brexit crisis triggering one within the next few months, McDonnell announcement carries much more weight.In another interview McDonnell himself speculated that an election might be imminent. He told Good Morning Britain:The Tories usually do this. If a general election is coming, what they’ll do is they’ll splash out some money and then if they win the election they then start cutting it back again.Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the Today programme this morning that Philip Hammond had “got lucky” because tax revenues were better than expected. Johnson told the Today programme:He’s just simply decided to spend all of that. I think he has abandoned any idea of getting to budget balance by the mid-2020s.Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has given various interviews this morning. Here are the main points.The overall envelope of funding that’s available in the spending review, once you take out the commitment we’ve made to health, gives flat real spending available for all other departments.When it was put to him that, if the average was flat and some departments got an increase, others would face a cut, he did not accept that. He said:We are raising both thresholds. Obviously people who pay higher rates of tax ... benefit from that. But 32m people who are paying basic rate tax will be £130 better off. 1.7m people will be moved out of paying high rate tax altogether. These are people on middle incomes who you could say should not be in higher rate tax at all. But over the years more and more people on middle incomes have been dragged into higher rate tax, and raising the threshold gets many of those people - who work in our schools, in our hospitals, in our police forces - back into being basic rate taxpayers again.Hammond also argued that he had to raise the allowance for higher earners because the Tories promised that in their election manifesto. When Today’s Nick Robinson put it to him that he had made a choice to cut income tax, Hammond replied:Nick, it is not a choice. When you make a promise to the electorate in an election manifesto, then you have an obligation to deliver on that promise.While many people will look at any deal no doubt and say ‘I don’t like this bit of it, I don’t like that bit of it’, as with so many things in life, it isn’t about, ‘Can we get this exactly how we want it, exactly perfect?’ It’s about looking at the options available to use and deciding which is the best one to go with, which is in the best interests of this country and the future. And I’m confident that the prime minister will get a deal with the European Union which my colleagues in parliament will consider carefully and, although they may not like every last aspect of it, I’m confident that they will conclude in the end that it is right to do a deal.If the economy suffers a shock - and a no-deal Brexit is an example of a shock, but actually we know from history that sometimes the shocks that hit the economy are not the ones we are expecting but ones we aren’t expecting - if there’s a shock to the economy, we will deal with it in the usual way.Very often a shock to the economy actually requires a boost to spending in the short term to support demand and to keep the economy going.I hope not. What we are preparing for is Britain’s future. We’ve now turned a corner and we are able to give Britain a bit of good news.The large companies that are being targeted by this are global players, they are large serious companies. They are people that HMRC have contact with. When we introduce a law which says they have to pay tax at a certain level on certain of their activities, they will pay. We’re very confident of that. These are not companies that are going to scuttle off and try to avoid that. At the moment there is no obligation on them to pay tax in the UK. We don’t have a tax that applies to them. That’s why it’s so important to introduce this digital services tax. Now we have a tax that they are required to pay in the UK and just like all other large and established companies, they will pay the tax due. We are very confident that we will have a high level of compliance.We retain an ambition to balance the budget.And he rejected claims he has abandoned fiscal rectitude. He told Today:You are painting a picture here that is designed to show that I’m abandoning fiscal rectitude. In every year of this forecast our deficit will get smaller.Schools funding will be dealt with in the spending review. We put £1.3bn of additional money into schools funding last year to protect per pupil spending in our schools and all of these things will be dealt with in the spending review. What I did yesterday was nothing to do with that process. It was simply giving back a little bit of the money that we have saved this year so that schools can buy the odd little piece of kit that they need. I think that’s a nice gesture. Many of the schools that I know will be very happy to have 50,000 or even 10,000 to buy a whiteboard, buy a couple of computers - whatever it is that they want to buy.The Resolution Foundation, a thinktank focusing on income inequality, has published its analysis of the budget. Here is its news release. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot’s story about it.And this is how it starts.The analysis by the Resolution Foundation thinktank found that welfare cuts would continue to affect the poorest households, despite Hammond’s announcement that austerity was coming to an end.Three-quarters of the £12bn in welfare cuts announced after the 2015 election remain government policy.The overall package of tax and benefit changes announced since 2015 will deliver an average gain of £390 for the richest fifth of households in 2023-24, the thinktank found, compared to an average loss of £400 for the poorest fifth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de66c585b3233c46a97b8cde3bb3c47d8af27e3d/0_31_4104_2462/master/4104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=149b1efe93ce4f440f41d886d6afe8e9","title":"philip hammond universal credit is here to stay","story":"Chancellor unveils extra investment as Labour calls for benefit to be fixed before next stage of rolloutUniversal credit is here to stay, Philip Hammond has said, as he announced extra investment in the flagship benefit aimed at making it more generous to some low-income working claimants.By injecting £1.7bn into work allowances, the chancellor reversed much of the cut to universal credit made by his predecessor, George Osborne, in 2015 and suggested ministers were fully committed to the much-delayed benefits overhaul programme.Hammond’s cash-for-work allowances may be enough to head off a threatened revolt by Conservative backbenchers concerned that some low-income working families on tax credits would be £200 a month worse off after moving to universal credit.“Universal credit is here to stay and we are putting in the funding needed to make it a success,” Hammond told the Commons. He said it was a “long overdue and necessary reform” of the benefits system that would help drive jobs and growth.Hammond also announced an extra £1bn over five years to provide extra protection for people on tax credits and other benefits who would be moved over to universal credit in the next few years. Details will be announced this year.There will be “run-on” support from 2020, whereby unemployed claimants will continue to receive existing benefits for two weeks after submitting their universal credit application, in a move aimed at easing the long waiting time for a first payment.Universal credit rolls together six working-age benefits into a single monthly payment, including jobseeker’s allowance, working tax credits and housing benefits. Work allowances are the amount claimants can earn before benefits start to be withdrawn. Higher work allowances in theory encourage claimants to move into work, or work longer hours.The Resolution Foundation thinktank welcomed the work allowance boost, saying the £1,000 threshold increase would deliver a £630 boost to low-income families, meaning universal credit was now more generous than the benefit system it was replacing.Torsten Bell, the Resolution Foundation chief executive, said: “While today’s reforms certainly won’t end all the problems some recipients have faced with universal credit, they should ease the rollout in the months and years ahead.”However, opposition politicians and charities emphasised ministers had not addressed wider cuts to welfare or structural problems with universal credit, such as the long waiting times for payment that forced some families into debt or to rely on food banks.John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, said: “The money promised for universal credit is less than a third of the £7bn of social security cuts still to come and today’s announcement on work allowances reverses just over half the cuts made in 2015.”Matthew Reed, the chief executive at the Children’s Society, said: “While the government has taken some important steps in the right direction it has still not done enough to address serious problems with universal credit which are causing hardship for many families.”Alison Garnham, the chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: “The work allowance increase is unequivocally good news for families receiving universal credit but a bigger salvage operation is still needed for the benefit.”Hammond’s striking endorsement of universal credit comes after criticism from two previous prime ministers, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown, who said the changes could trigger poll tax-levels of public unpopularity.Labour has called for universal credit to be halted and fixed before the next stage of its rollout, which will lead to 2 million claimants on tax credits and employment and support allowance migrate on to the new system during the next three years.The chancellor has also been under intense pressure from Conservative backbenchers and poverty campaigners to restore the level of work allowances, seen by many as essential if universal credit is to uphold its original aims of incentivising work.Hammond pointedly paid tribute to the political architect of universal credit, the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, now a backbench MP, “without whose tenacity universal credit would never have seen the light”.Duncan Smith oversaw the introduction of universal credit in the face of opposition from Osborne and a series of implementation disasters. He resigned from the cabinet in 2016 in part over cuts to work allowances the previous autumn.The chancellor’s announcement on work allowances was welcomed by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which called it “an important step forward” in tackling the rise of in-work poverty that it said would help ease the burden for low-income families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f8911a0166ac807a9ec23227f1549a6b8dca307/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18c515c11f25e48b4865e96809a16aac","title":"serik konakbayev stand aiba presidential election cas boxing","story":"The fight for the future of amateur boxing will be a two-way tussle after the court of arbitration for sport ruled that Serik Konakbayev could stand in Saturday’s Aiba presidential election.Konakbayev, a silver medallist at the 1980 Moscow Olympics and the head of the Asian Boxing Confederation, was initially prevented from standing following a dispute over whether his nominations were received in time.However Cas overturned the decision of Aiba’s election committee, which means that Konakbayev is free to face Gafur Rakhimov, the interim Aiba president who denies accusations from the US treasury that he is one of Uzbekistan’s leading criminals with links to the global heroin trade.Speaking to the , Konakbayev admitted that restoring trust in Aiba, which has been told it is in “grave danger” by the International Olympic Committee because of its failure to deal with governance, financial and other issues, would be the “toughest fight of my life”.“The IOC has taken clear, forceful, and unprecedented measures to highlight the issues facing Aiba – this shows just how alarmed the IOC is with the current situation,” he said.“Aiba has very serious financial problems. And because of recent reputational issues it is not possible to attract the type of television and sponsorship partnerships that the sport deserves. In addition, approximately $17m expected from the IOC following the Tokyo Games is now under threat.“We need to properly address and solve the issues of trust and governance facing Aiba and ensure that we retain our IOC recognition as an Olympic sport,” he added. “And we need to get away from using the money that comes from the IOC to keep the Aiba administration afloat.”Konakbayev, who would be the first elite boxer to lead Aiba if elected, also warned boxing federations that they should heed the IOC’s warnings about a full boxing programme at Tokyo 2020 being in jeopardy.“The IOC believes that the behaviour of Aiba is having a negative effect on the reputation of Olympic sport and not just on boxing, so the threat needs to be taken seriously,” he said. “We should not forget that the IOC stripped the Olympic status of wrestling in 2013.”Konakbayev, who is backed by England Boxing and many of the European federations, also promised to tackle the problem of corruption in judging – which reared its head again at the Rio Olympics after the Irish boxer Michael Conlan railed against the judges after losing against Vladimir Nikitin of Russia.“We all know that scandals and disputes related to refereeing and judging has damaged our sport’s reputation badly in the past,” said Konakbayev. “We need a more balanced and objective way of choosing officials, especially for the major competitions.“This can no longer depend on relationships but on merit and appointments, and should be transparent. I also want to forbid the involvement of Aiba management in any judging situation.”Konakbayev stressed that a key part of his manifesto was bringing more women into the higher levels of the sport. “We want to have more women boxers, but also more women as administrators and officials,” he added. “I will create gender equality ambassadors to promote and accelerate the process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ff427f766054224758aed1c96c4d68d603ffd15/0_9_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d9f538a1e0a57e5e880788d8687d7cc","title":"nadal djokovic saudi exhibition tennis match jeddah","story":"The two players have at least addressed the situation but going ahead with December’s game in Jeddah given the global outrage over Jamal Khashoggi’s death is a mistakeOf the many withering put‑downs John McEnroe uttered in his playing career, a favourite remains his response to why he refused to play Björn Borg in apartheid South Africa: “I’ve got better ways to earn a million dollars.”In nine words McEnroe told the world he did not need to compromise his values or expose himself to ridicule – even for a million dollars. He was worth more than that. He was good enough to make up the slack somewhere else. He and Borg were at the height of their celebrity, having just played a Wimbledon final that was described then and for years to come as the greatest of all time, to be eclipsed only, perhaps, by that between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in 2008.In 1980, however, a million dollars was quite some inducement to break the international sporting embargo on South Africa. And this year McEnroe elaborated for the first time about the controversy. Speaking to the American journalist Graham Bensinger he said: “At that time it was worth at least $10m now or more, but I feel proud that I made that decision. I thought to myself: ‘Yeah, this is an unbelievable amount of money but there’s a reason why they’re offering it – because they’re going to take advantage of me and sort of use that propaganda in a way.’“I was 21 but I could get that. I wasn’t going to be the pawn in that whole thing. I took pride in that. It felt wrong … it wasn’t that difficult a decision. I was 21, I didn’t need the money that bad yet. I think that was one of the better decisions that I made in my career.”You would imagine, then, 38 years on, that Nadal (who, like McEnroe in 1980, does not need the money) and Novak Djokovic (likewise) would come up with a similar response in almost identical circumstances. As of this moment, however – no.At the first opportunity to explain or justify their involvement in a $1m-apiece exhibition on 22 December in Saudi Arabia (where state-sponsored killing is as blatant as it was in South Africa in 1980), they were toweringly equivocal in press conferences in Paris at the weekend. Nadal said of his reluctance to be drawn into a discussion about the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi: “Of course I’m aware of all the situation. But I had a commitment since one year ago to play there. And my team is talking to them, to analyse the things. That’s it.“As you know, when these kind of things happen … it’s terrible that one journalist lost the life. I know something happened very bad inside there. So we are looking about how evolves the situation and I hope the things will clarify as soon as possible.”Djokovic was equally adroit at avoiding a head-on confrontation with his hosts. “I personally always try to be very apolitical. I don’t like to involve myself in any political exchange or situations. And it’s unfortunate that we are both drawn into this right now.“All I can say is that we have the commitment with them for over a year. Actually last year when we were discussing this potential match-up, we agreed that it’s going to happen in December as a kind of a lead-up to the beginning of the season. And it was my professional tennis decision to do that.“And of course I know, I’m aware of what’s happening. And it’s sad, of course. It’s the only thing that you can feel when you see something like that and when you hear something like that. But I can’t say more than that. My team right now is in touch with the people in Saudi Arabia as well as Rafa’s and of course we are all talking to understand the situation better.“Right now we just don’t have obviously enough information and we have to look into that a bit more and then we’ll make our decision soon. It’s a commitment. And I’ve been always trying to be very professional and respectful towards people that I have commitment with. We are trying to take in consideration everything, all the options.”Exactly how much more information even athletes inside their bubbles would need to know about an incident that has played globally across all media for weeks is difficult to imagine.So, until they withdraw, this pointless public relations stunt in Jeddah on 22 December goes ahead with their blessing, before they fly out to Australia for the Australian Open. Indeed, central to their defence was the claim that “the tournament” was part of their preparation for the first major of 2019 – as if they would not benefit more from rest (given the repeated complaint that they have too many commitments) or playing in a way more competitive environment than an over-hyped friendly hit in front of royalty in the desert.And what excuse will Europe’s best golfers come up with if they take part in the Saudi International, a tournament added to the 2019 schedule and due to take place at the Royal Greens Golf and Country Club in King Abdullah Economic City from 31 January? Probably none."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e7ca35979e3aa78a1078364da6baac8808114a0/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be9b4103d6257588540649cf9b87501b","title":"talking horses what does it mean if davy russell rides one at bangor","story":"Punters must ask themselves whether the famed Irishman’s presence amounts to a tip in itselfWhat’s Davy Russell doing at Bangor for one ride? This is just one of the questions facing punters today, but a key one, since the Irishman is aboard a clear favourite, Epalo De La Thinte, in the bumper race that closes Bangor’s card.It’s the sort of booking that makes you think, ‘This thing is surely expected.’ A single riding fee of £169.85 is surely not enough by itself to get Russell to Bangor On Dee, for all that it may not be the most onerous journey an Irish jockey could make to a British track.Russell’s involvement catches the eye, of course, and I think he was winning a Grand National when last he competed here. But, for whatever reason, he hasn’t been one of those guys that trainers reach for when they’ve plotted one up for a low-profile bumper. He’s only won five such races in Britain in his career, from 51 mounts, if Racing Post stats are accurate. So I’d guess that Doyle trusts him and wants his opinion on Epalo De La Thinte, but that this is not necessarily a winner waiting to happen.My interest at Bangor is in Cuddles McGraw (2.10), who had three spins over hurdles up to June and has been rated on his efforts in that sphere for today’s novice handicap chase. There was some promise in those hurdles efforts but this five-year-old has been a chaser in the making and I’ll take a chance on him at 7-2. He is not quick and perhaps he’s going to need three miles but it seems to me that Fergal O’Brien knows what he’s doing with horses campaigned in this way.At Chepstow, With Pleasure (2.50) appeals at 5-1 in a handicap hurdle. John Flint’s runner is 09 over hurdles so far but this step up to three miles can be a big help to him, judging by the way he finished off a stayers race at Pontefract on the Flat this month. Tom O’Brien returns to the saddle for the first time since they were second at Uttoxeter in May last year, when With Pleasure was barely a four-year-old.The nap goes at Catterick, where Illustrissime (1.25) is a general 2-1 shot in a small field. This five-year-old has been around a few yards but finally scored for Ivan Furtado after a wind op and a step up in distance. He’s only 4lb higher, back over the same course and distance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11e08b0934bb0f8593ff855e143c27d9116f5111/0_234_4831_2900/master/4831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cb6f20129b04ed986ffc43365cb9b97","title":"how did inside no 9 spring the biggest live tv surprise of the year","story":"Live episodes are often a painful, gimmicky exercise but Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith’s take on the format was one of 2018’s stand-out momentsFor the first five minutes at least, it looked thoroughly generic. Arthur Flitwick (Steve Pemberton) is back from the shops. He puts a mobile phone on the kitchen table, sticks Symphonic FM on and sets about coddling an egg. The phone rings, there is some sinister but indistinct white noise, the egg explodes in the microwave and the caller rings off. Flitwick redials the last number and what appears to be some vaguely underwhelming domestic farce involving a lost phone and a confused old lady begins to ensue.It is often said that in the age of Twitter and on-demand streaming, secrets are impossible to keep shocks are diffuse and signposted TV is no longer a communal experience. This autumn has presented two strong rebuttals to that idea. First, there was Jed Mercurio’s frantic drama Bodyguard. But last night, the truly audacious live special of Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith’s dark anthology comedy Inside No 9 went further still. You really did have to be there.From Flitwick’s phone call onwards, all bets were off. The arrival of Shearsmith’s vicar Reverend Neale saw the manifestation of the first gremlins: the sound disappeared and BBC Two’s continuity announcer intervened. Twitter collectively speculated about P45s on the way to the production crew and the show lost a fifth of its viewers as the less patient gave up the ghost. But the ghost was just getting started. A repeated (largely silent) episode of Inside No 9 began, but soon we were back in real time, in Pemberton and Shearsmith’s dressing room. Shearsmith flicked on the News at 10 where the green and gold flags of Jair Bolsonaro’s celebrating supporters could be glimpsed. Yes, this was actually happening, right now.This perfectly perplexing half hour of television has been in preparation for a while. The production team have been carefully seeding the show’s central conceit: the haunting of Granada studios. An article appeared in the Sun last week claiming that interventions from deceased Coronation Street stars had been making rehearsals impossible. But even so, what began to unfold was remarkable and unsettling. BBC Two itself appeared to be possessed, stricken by visitations from the studio’s illustrious and traumatic past. From Bobby Davro’s notorious faceplant during the filming of shiny-floor folly Public Enemy Number One to a serious fire during which costumes for The Jewel in The Crown were destroyed, we were suddenly scrolling through an index of Granada-based mishaps. Who knew where it would stop?Were people fooled? However much they might deny it now, yes they were. And actually, what fun to be so playfully toyed with by television to gaze at your screen and feel genuinely bewildered. But better yet, Shearsmith and Pemberton included us, made us participants. Shearsmith tweeted “Are me and Steve Pemberton on BBC two now?” and people replied. Viewers’ real time reactions became part of the spectacle in a way that felt more profound than usual, possibly because what we had seen had been confounding enough to make speculation unavoidable. Co-star Stephanie Cole’s Wikipedia entry was altered to reflect her sad, on-screen suicide as the possessed studio continued to work its dark magic.Event TV is a term that is now lazily applied to everything from cookery shows to talent contests. But the Inside No 9 live special really did deserve that description. It is now on BBC iPlayer and is well worth a second (or indeed, first) look. But if you weren’t there at 10pm on Sunday, you missed the essence of it. What the show demonstrated was that in the hands of true masters, modern media networks like Twitter are simply more tools, more colours a writer can add to their palette. The show’s closest relative is probably BBC One’s spectacular 1992 Halloween epic Ghostwatch. But Ghostwatch was able to take advantage of less jaded, less media-savvy, more credulous times. To even approach its mischief and magic in 2018 feels like a triumph of imagination. It also feels like a vindication of the idea that in the right hands, TV still has the capacity to surprise, disconcert and delight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fb2b6b6d8a29fd62ea995a21b4b876b20339d9d/0_0_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56f8802f1694d1cc11c8caf86c4e5490","title":"democrats midterms divisions progressives centrists","story":"Progressives and moderates tell the  of competing visions for the future of the left. But they are united in one thing: resistance to TrumpOn a sticky autumn evening, less than a month before the November midterm elections, more than 200 left-of-center New Yorkers packed an uptown auditorium for an Oxford-style debate on a central question animating Democratic politics: will progressive populism save the party?For nearly two hours, Democrats from the progressive and moderate wings sharply defended competing visions for the future of their party as it clambers back from the political wilderness.“They have wrecked the party,” said Jeff Weaver, a senior political adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders and his 2016 presidential campaign manager, jabbing a finger in the direction of the moderate panelists. “They have destroyed the coalition that undergirded the Democratic party for decades and we can’t let them have it back.”He clashed with Jonathan Cowan, president and co-founder of the centrist thinktank Third Way, who said the left’s revolutionary policy aspirations “might look good on a bumper sticker” but are removed from political reality. If Democrats ran on a populist platform in 2020, he warned, Donald Trump would be re-elected.As tensions flared, the moderator interjected playfully: “I have to keep reminding myself, you guys all belong to the same party.”On election day 2016, Democrats suffered one of the most stunning losses in modern presidential history. Twice in less than two decades, they won the popular vote but lost the presidency – this time to a historically unpopular candidate. The House and Senate remained in Republican control, as did a majority of state houses and governorships. In Washington and around the country, their grip on power had slipped to its weakest point in nearly a century. Democrats were left wondering: What now?Since then, the party’s center of gravity has shifted sharply away from Washington, toward an emboldened activist base, as its politics drift to the left. Across the country, a rising coalition of women, young people and minorities are crashing the gates of the Democratic party and demanding a seat at the table while liberal insurgents rattle the establishment in a forceful rejection of politics as usual. At the same time, a sprawling field of potential presidential candidates are rushing to plant their stakes in a shifting political landscape.The debate, hosted by Intelligence Squared US, underscored the fierce contest of ideas taking place within the Democratic party two years into the Trump presidency – and on the eve of the November midterm elections.“What happened in 2016 wasn’t just a win for Donald Trump – it was also a moment of reckoning for Democrats,” said Jahana Hayes, a first-time candidate who beat a veteran politician in the Democratic primary for Connecticut’s fifth congressional district. “There’s a strong appetite right now for change. People are looking for something different and they want candidates who are not afraid to articulate that change.”Interviews with more than two dozen elected officials, candidates, strategists and activists describe a party in the midst of extraordinary transformation – a composite of competing interests and priorities united by a resistance to the Trump administration.Hayes is at the vanguard of that cultural upheaval.The former social studies teacher, who was named national teacher of the year in 2016, never expected to enter politics. Hayes launched what was considered to be a long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination in May, running on progressive priorities such as single-payer healthcare, known as “Medicare for All”, and stricter gun laws. She highlighted her life story: a childhood of poverty, a brief period of homelessness and a pregnancy – all before graduating high school. But she continued to pursue her education and eventually became a teacher in the community where she grew up.In August, Democrats defied the party and nominated Hayes. Now she is poised to be elected Connecticut’s first black congresswoman.Her victory was one of a handful of primary-night surprises that ushered in a wave of fresh faces. The most dramatic of those upsets were in deep-blue districts, where liberal insurgents challenged the Democratic hierarchy and brought down long-serving incumbents.This summer in New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a young Democratic socialist and former bartender, wrested the nomination from congressman Joe Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat and a potential contender for House speaker.Months later, in Massachusetts, Ayanna Pressley, a Boston City council member, ousted the congressman Michael Capuano, a 10-term progressive who had the backing of many of the state’s political leaders.In all three primary contests, the candidates were propelled by a sense of urgency, encapsulated by Pressley’s campaign slogan: “Change can’t wait.” They harnessed mounting frustration with the status quo and a strong desire for bottom-up regeneration.“Let’s expand what our party looks like,” Hayes said. “Let’s engage more people. Let’s broaden our depth of understanding.”The spirited primary season ended last month in New York, with a decisive victory for Governor Andrew Cuomo over his leftwing challenger, Cynthia Nixon.The next morning, at a press conference in his Manhattan office, Cuomo, the two-term Democratic incumbent, whose corporate ties and dynastic status epitomize everything the left despises about the party elite, gloated that the “wave” of progressive victories expected to sweep the Democratic party never materialized.“Not even a ripple,” he said, dismissing Ocasio-Cortez’s win as a “fluke”. Cuomo touted his progressive accomplishments as governor: raising the minimum wage, creating a paid family leave program and legalizing gay marriage.“I’m not a socialist. I am not 25 years old. I’m not a newcomer,” he said. “But I am a progressive, and I deliver progressive results.”For the centrists watching, Cuomo’s victory lap was a welcome reality check on the narrative that the progressive left had taken over the Democratic party.Unlike the Tea Party wave of 2010, when Republican voters replaced establishment favorites and moderate dealmakers with fire-breathing conservatives and ideological purists, no sitting Democratic senator lost a seat this cycle. Far from the rule, liberal dragon-slayers were the exception.“The progressive movement is energized,” writes Elaine Kamarck, a senior Brookings fellow who led the project, “but there is not much evidence that it is taking over the Democratic party or pulling it far to the left.”The liberal insurgency that roared to life in the wake of the 2016 election shows no signs of abating anytime soon. Already, progressive activists have demonstrated their strength in confronting leadership and driving party’s internal policy debate.They count among their achievements the fact that more than half of House Democrats and one-third of Senate Democrats, including a handful of potential 2020 contenders, have co-signed Medicare for All legislation. This summer, the Democratic National Committee reformed its presidential nominating process to reduce the influence of party elites, which was a source of contention during the bitter 2016 primary campaign. There is an emerging consensus around a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage. And dozens of Democratic candidates – including more than half of the candidates in districts the party is targeting – are taking a page from Sanders and refusing donations from political action committees, or Pacs, that are sponsored by corporations or industry groups.The revolution, they say, is just beginning.How the Democrats fare on Election Day will set the stage for the next battle: how they should approach 2020.In several competitive House districts where Republicans are defending their majority, Democratic voters have nominated left-of-center candidates who stopped short of embracing positions like Medicare for All and a federal minimum wage. If Democrats win the House on election night, moderates will point to these results as evidence that a moderate message, and not leftwing populism, is the best strategy to win voters beyond the liberal bastions where the party still holds power.Progressives see the electoral map differently. They argue that the depth of Democrats’ losses in 2016 proves that the only way to defeat Trump and Republicans is with a set of radical economic ideas that mobilize liberals and non-traditional voters.“Our swing voter is not red-to-blue,” Ocasio-Cortez told an audience of progressive activists at the Netroots Nation conference earlier this year. “It’s non-voter to voter.”Yet as Democrats look ahead to 2020, new research argues that the party is not as riven by ideological conflict as it appeared to be during the 2016 primary campaign.The best predictors of whom a Democrat would support in the primary, they found, were race, age and whether the voter identified more strongly with the Democratic party or being liberal.Aspects of identity could play an even bigger role in the next presidential election cycle. The prospective 2020 candidates will likely be erse in terms of gender, race and age. Trump’s potential rivals traverse the ideological spectrum of the left and have demonstrated different strategies for confronting the president.Deep-seated differences do exist, however, over economic and foreign policy, and on issues of regulation, trade and how aggressively to challenge corporate power. There are also long-held philosophical disagreements over whether rising income inequality is “the defining issue of our time”, as Barack Obama once said.Robert Reich, secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton and a strident critic of Wall Street, credits Sanders with amplifying the issue of economic equality. But he recalled that Hillary Clinton launched her campaign with a video message in which she declared that the “deck is stacked in favor of those at the top”.“That was a shocking statement for an establishment candidate to make,” he said.On 19 October 2016, Bob Bland, then a fashion designer in New York City and nine months pregnant with her second child, was one of the nearly 72 million Americans who tuned in to watch the third and final presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. As Clinton expounded on her plan to fund social security, Trump leaned into his microphone. “Such a nasty woman,” he sneered.The phrase immediately struck a chord. Bland pulled open her laptop and started designing a T-shirt that said “Nasty Woman”. The next morning, she put the shirt online for sale. By noon that day, she was receiving a new order every second, with the proceeds going to Planned Parenthood.“It was my first foray into political activism,” she said. “I suddenly had this group of nasty women who were constantly contacting me and asking me what they could do to help.” They decided to share photos of themselves wearing the shirts at polling stations on election day. (“It was a voter mobilization effort – but I didn’t know the term at the time,” she said.)The next morning, in the fog of despair, Bland proposed the idea of a march in Washington on Facebook. Within hours, her community of “nasty women” expanded into thousands. When she discovered another woman in Hawaii had a similar idea and had already collected 12,000 responses, she quickly made contact. They joined forces and the Women’s March was born.If the November midterm elections deliver a “blue wave” of Democratic victories in Congress and state legislatures, it will have been fueled in large part by an energized network of newly motivated liberal activists who, like Bland, have thrown themselves into political activism over the past two years.One in five Americans have protested or participated in political rallies and demonstrations since 2016 – and the vast majority of those activists are hostile to Trump.What began with meetings in living rooms and public libraries grew into “the Resistance”, a sprawling web of loosely knit national, local and hyper-local grassroots groups dedicated to thwarting Trump’s agenda and electing Democrats. They are aided by national organizations such as Inisible and Action Together, which formed after Trump’s victory and help coordinate and support the work of the countless smaller groups that have sprung up around local campaigns and issues.The movement’s political ambitions have only expanded since the Women’s March, as they clash with the Trump administration over its withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, a decision to separate immigrant families at the border and the controversial confirmation of the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh.The Resistance is led by mostly white, college-educated, suburban women from across the ideological spectrum of the left, according to Theda Skocpol, a sociologist at Harvard who is studying the anti-Trump resistance. Though united in opposition to the president, this movement is distinct from the progressive insurgency. Activists are far less concerned with the party’s internal debate over ideology and strategy and much more focused on getting out the vote for Democrats in November, Skocpol found.“This will not look like a far-left reinvention of Tea Partiers or a continuation of Bernie 2016,” Skocpol and Lara Putnam write in the journal Democracy. “It will look like retired librarians rolling their eyes at the present state of affairs, and then taking charge.” Or, as Bland put it: they are “soccer moms who suddenly sound like revolutionaries”.Their political resurgence has helped repopulate local and state Democratic parties, many in suburban and conservative stretches of the country, that had atrophied during the Obama years.It has also been a source of candidate recruitment for the party. Two years ago, 27 House Republican candidates ran unopposed in their districts. This year, Democrats will contest all but three House districts, according to Ballotpedia.That charge is being led by a historically erse field of candidates. Democratic women shattered records for gubernatorial and congressional nominees this cycle. Three African American candidates are running for governor – two in the old Confederacy. Elsewhere, Native Americans, Muslims, Latinos, immigrants, and LGBT candidates will be on the ballot in November.“It started on November 9, 2016, as a reaction based on anger – a feeling that I’ve got to make a change. I’ve got to fight Trump. I’ve got to fight everything that’s going to happen,” said Stephanie Schriock, president of Emily’s List. “But then it became so much bigger.”During the 2016 presidential election cycle, her group – the largest national organization dedicated to electing women to office – heard from 920 women interested in running. Since Trump’s election, the organization has been contacted by more than 42,000 women who want to run for office.“This isn’t about one election cycle,” Schriock said. “What we’re seeing is a sea change.”Earlier this month, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts liberal who is exploring a 2020 presidential run, traveled to Jonesboro, Georgia, to work the phones on behalf of the Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.If elected, Abrams would be the country’s first black female governor. Her historic campaign has managed to excite both the progressive and moderate wings of the party. During the debate in New York earlier this month, the panelists argued over whether she was running as a “pragmatic leader” or an “ultra-progressive”.If Abrams can win in Georgia, a state with a tortured history of race relations and where Democrats hold no statewide offices, her victory could provide clues for how the party can unite voters across the geographic, demographic and ideological spectrum.After placing a few calls to Georgia voters urging them to vote for Abrams, Warren addressed the volunteers at their cramped field office outside Atlanta. She acknowledged the depths from which Democrats would have to come to wrest power from the Republicans, but she urged them not to despair.“They got the White House. They got the House of Representatives. They got the Senate,” Warren said, holding her left fist in the air. “They got the statehouses all around the country. They got the money. They got the big, big, big donors. They got the coordination. But I’m gonna tell you this: I’d rather be us than them.”After two years of soul-searching, marching, protesting and organizing, the midterm elections on 6 November will test Warren’s optimism in the future of her party. If history is still a guide in 2018, election night should produce gains for the opposition party. Polling data favors Democrats to win control of the House and a handful of governor’s mansions, including in states Trump won. That would be a start.But some of the most critical challenges lie ahead. Democrats will soon choose a standard-bearer from what will almost certainly be a broad group of erse candidates. That decision will involve complex questions of ideology and identity – distinguished by race, gender and age.They will also have to make choices about strategy, tone and temperament. Does the party embrace leftwing populism or return to consensus-oriented pragmatism? Do they want someone who embodies change but doesn’t fit into a strict ideological box? How forcefully do they confront Trump? Above all, the candidate – and it is as likely to be a she as a he – must have a vision with broad enough appeal to oust a president who has defied convention and rewritten the rules of engagement.The stakes could not be higher for the party out of power. Democrats are either on the verge of a comeback – or teetering on collapse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd46e449882db63b9fbe6cc5cb5e6219373a0019/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfad84ce97d26d0b2c6aaa963fda12a3","title":"wisconsin scott walker rightwing republican young people","story":"Walker has undone Wisconsin’s progressive past and turned it into a lab for rightwing governance – but millennials have a different vision for the futureOutside the Chazen Art Museum on the campus of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, a shark, a banana and Nada Elmikashfi are trying to corral students to the polls for the first day of voting.Madison, the liberal heart and state capital of Wisconsin, is in the final stages of a squeakingly tight race to decide the political future of this once progressive state that is now deeply conservative – at least in terms of policy.Like many of the young voters on campus, Elmikashfi is determined to reverse the state’s decade-long lurch to the right. Beneath a cornflower blue sky Elmikashfi and two friends in fancy dress are handing out leaflets explaining why this midterm vote is so important. And why is it so vital to her? “I’m a black Muslim woman and an immigrant,” she says. “I am trying to reclaim my voice.”Wisconsin is in many ways emblematic of the deep ide roiling American politics. Since 2010 its union-busting governor, Scott Walker, has pursued small government, pro big-business policies that have undone Wisconsin’s progressive past and turned it into a laboratory for conservative governance. His policies have become a test bed for the Koch brothers and other rightwing billionaires – a model for their larger vision of America trotted out for others to copy at rightwing thinktanks across the country.Walker – according to tax-hating political advocate Grover Norquist – has been more influential in defeating the progressive agenda than Trump. If his policies are “enacted in a dozen more states, the modern Democratic party will cease to be a competitive power in American politics. It’s that big a deal,” he wrote last year.The governor seems to have been born hard right. At elementary school Walker started a “Jesus USA” club and at university he told a fellow student: “God told me I am chosen to cut taxes and stop killing babies.” His popularity is low these days and he’s trying to win people back with tweets about his everyman eating habits, but there’s no denying his effectiveness.Walker’s supporters won a major victory in 2016 when Donald Trump won the state – the first time Wisconsin had elected a Republican president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Walker has worked tirelessly to disenfranchise voters and gerrymander Wisconsin into a shape that makes it easier for Republicans to win. If elected to a third term he could ensure the party’s dominance for a generation.Hillary Clinton, notoriously, hardly bothered to campaign in Wisconsin in 2016. This time the fight to stop Walker’s vision of the future has attracted top-tier talent. Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and rising stars like Kamala Harris have all been out supporting Walker’s opponent – Tony Evers, the state’s superintendent of education.But that legacy could – potentially – be Walker’s undoing. For millennial students, many voting for the first time, their first taste of politics was during the wave of strikes and protests that came after Walker rammed through Act 10 – legislation that stripped public school teachers of their right to collective bargaining and forced educators to contribute far more to their health insurance and pensions.The millennials were out in force in the Capitol Ballroom of the Madison Concourse Hotel last weekend at a rally for the Democratic senator Tammy Baldwin, currently running comfortably out in front for re-election against Leah Vukmir, a Wisconsin senator with close ties to the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec).“I’ve grown up with Scott Walker and seen how things have gotten worse,” said Sigal Felber, a student at the University of Wisconsin. “School funding, potholes, concealed-carry signs. He’s not for the people, he’s for the Republicans.” Felber is 20 and has voted in every election she has been qualified to vote in. It’s not typical of young voters, who often tend to miss the polls, but she says she thinks that is changing.Her friend and fellow student Laura Livermore, 19, agreed. She has voted in previous primaries and even for supreme court justices. “I think people are tired of this. We want change,” she said.The hollowing out of the unions and Walker’s spending cuts have fundamentally changed Wisconsin. It’s a historic shift documented in Dan Kaufman’s new book The Fall of Wisconsin: The Conservative Conquest of a Progressive Bastion and the Future of American Politics.Under Walker Wisconsin has witnessed one of the largest declines in its middle class of any state. Its poverty rate is at a 30-year high and its roads are the second worst in the union – locals refer to “Scottholes”.Kaufman argues that Walker’s success in beating the unions effectively paved the way for Trump, hitting the pockets of the unions, the only group powerful enough to take on the massive amounts of corporate, rightwing money now pouring into races across the country. “There’s a lot of interest in the book across the midwest,” Kaufman said. “A lot of things that have happened there are happening here.” In regions that handed the presidency to Trump.The polling suggests Walker is in the fight of his life. Evers currently has a slight lead, according to Real Clear Politics, but it’s too close to call, and writing off a campaigner as skilled as Walker would be a mistake.In Oak Creek near Milwaukee, Republican Bryan Steil is running for the seat being vacated by the House speaker, Paul Ryan, in a vicious and closely fought race with the ironworker and rising Democratic star Randy Bryce. The candidates’ attitudes towards Israel was the top priority for Vernon Engstrom, a 51-year-old automotive worker who supports Steil. He doesn’t like Trump’s style but supports his policies. “I am a Christian and he’s supportive of Christians. Trump does seem to be doing what he said he’d do,” he said,Another supporter who would only give her first name, Carol, and age, 68, hissed with anger at the “mess” she said Barack Obama had left. “We have suffered eight years of the worst policies. The economy was so bad. It was all such a mess,” she said, before submitting a question to the candidates about their attitudes to later-term abortions.Tommy Thompson, former Republican governor of Wisconsin, said the state had always been politically ided.What he says has changed is the viciousness of the debate. Thompson, the longest-serving governor in the state’s history, is currently appearing in ads for Walker. Tellingly, Walker’s ads often use surrogates – he clearly knows how many people feel about him. Locals say it’s the first time Thompson has done ads for Walker but Thompson said “he can’t remember”.“He should have used me before, I am very popular,” he said. It’s certainly one of the most gentle ads bombarding Wisconsinites, none of the accusations of “plagiarism” or attacks from family members that feature in other ads.What disappoints Thompson about the current race is just how angry the state has become. “I think people have had enough. The pushing and shoving, the shouting – from both sides. This is not America.” After the race is over, he hopes, people will come together. “It’s time for us to set our anger aside,” he says. It’s a nice thought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b83c441387eb4e32b8f54f487c1d7e2d012538b3/191_30_1870_1122/master/1870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e7a4e0236ae6932c515677071bb3478","title":"the remains of stalin gulag railroad soviet union a photo essay","story":"In Russia’s Arctic wilderness, the remnants of one of the Soviet Union’s most notorious gulag projects lie largely forgottenFrom 1947 until 1953, tens of thousands of prisoners, many of them “politicals” convicted for “anti-Soviet acts”, were shipped to northern Russia to lay a railroad through some of the harshest terrain on Earth.The railroad would have connected Russia’s Arctic waters with its western railway network.Most records relating to the gulags, the brutal network of forced-labour camps for dissenters, criminals, and other perceived threats, remain secret. But it is likely that Stalin, spooked by the incursion of Nazi submarines into the Arctic during the second world war, wanted the railway in place as a means of supplying a planned naval port. The railway also would have connected northern nickel mines to Soviet factories in the west.But just days after Stalin’s death in 1953, the project was cancelled amid the subsequent Soviet “thaw”. Since then, the railway’s gulag camps have lain abandoned, sinking further into the forest under the weight of each winter’s snow. Getting to the camps today is difficult outside of winter, with most lying beyond terrain that would bog a tank.Only specialised vehicles, like this balloon-tyred Trekol in which Chapple travelled, are able to move through the swampy region where the railroad was laid.But the biggest threat to survival, according to another former prisoner, came from the brutal winters, which frequently dropped below -40C (-40F).Prisoners were kept ided in gendered barracks. One survivor, Alexandr Snovsky, says the men would throw letters into the female zone to communicate in secret.Some remains, such as this shack that probably housed guards, have been maintained and are regularly used by hunters.Most engineers engaged on the railway were free workers, while the heavy labour was carried out by prisoners. Most of the railway, as evidenced by this old signal marker, has fallen into ruin.For Snovsky, who now lives with his wife near St Petersburg, the biggest tragedy was the project’s futility: “Tens of thousands of human lives for nothing. For me, the saddest thing was that it was for nothing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecf60937d892edb62590902e7f956b099b5a35d3/0_312_4675_2805/master/4675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5773bd51d20d0ceea1915a0154a078b","title":"america black farmers louisiana sugarcane","story":"Sugarcane farmers can’t survive without large crop loans. For the Provosts, who say they suffered decades of discrimination, this could be the end of the line by  Debbie Weingarten, with pictures by Audra MulkernOn the summer day in 2014 that June Provost found three stray cats dead and lined up side by side in his tractor, the forecast had called for rain. It was hot and overcast, the air like a heavy and suffocating blanket, and the sugarcane was already 6ft high.Wenceslaus Provost Jr – who has gone by the name June since he can remember – stared in shock at the cats, each one with the tabby markings of strays. He could see no visible lacerations, no insides spilling out. He guessed it had been the work of a BB gun or a strangling.He looked away, disgusted. As the breeze rattled through the sugarcane leaves, he thought: “This is a warning.”A year earlier, June and his wife, Angie, had found a chain tied around the steering wheel of a tractor and the hydraulic lines stuffed with mud. But the dead cats were a marked escalation in intimidation. The following day, June found the windows of another tractor shot out. Later that season, someone hid cinderblocks in Angie’s fields to ruin the equipment.Around that same time, Angie and June noticed vehicles parking near her fields, the drivers watching her work. June recognized one of the drivers as a representative of MA Patout \u0026amp Son sugar mill, the company he contracted with to harvest and mill his sugarcane. The whole season became an unrelenting act of apparent sabotage. Motor oil was repeatedly drained from vehicles. Fuel lines were filled with water. There was hardly a week without an incident.“This was someone trying to stop the operation,” June says. “They knew exactly what to do with a tractor.”After multiple police reports, June says, a sheriff’s deputy told them: “Someone wants what you have by any means necessary.”In mid-May, the south Louisiana earth is parched, and the cane is nothing but 2ft-tall grass. Once the rain comes, it will grow like weeds. By August, the sugarcane will tower over grown men, and by late fall, it will be milled into molasses and raw sugar. During milling season, entire towns will smell like syrup. It’s a landscape reminiscent of the one shown in the television drama Queen Sugar – produced by the Oprah Winfrey Network and based on a novel by Natalie Baszile – about a black sugarcane farm family determined to save their land, despite blatant racism and land-grabbing by the white sugar mill owners.Each year in Louisiana, farmers produce 13m tons of sugarcane, generating $3bn. It is a lucrative crop to produce, due to regulated production limits and tariff-rate quotas that protect US supply from foreign competition. It is, as the American Sugar Cane League proudly notes, “arguably the most successful crop in the history of our state”.As a child, June, now 42, would prop his elbows in the windows of his dad’s baby blue Ford and they would ride out to check the cane fields, some of which have been farmed by his family for four generations. As a teenager, he filled diesel tanks and monitored oil levels in the tractors. At 18, he officially went to work on the family’s 2,500-acre farm. After his father retired in 2006, June began the process to purchase the business.But he says he endured years of discrimination in the form of coercive contracts, fraud, below-market crop loans, vandalism, and retaliation for speaking out about the mistreatment of black farmers – until he was finally forced out of business in 2015. “They took my livelihood, my family’s legacy,” says June, his voice swelling with grief. “They took what I love.”June says there were approximately 60 black sugarcane farmers in the area in 1983. He keeps their names neatly printed, line after line, in a notebook.By 2000, that number had dwindled to 17. Today, June and Angie count only four.On a humid May morning, the attorney Quinton Robinson rolls his briefcase toward a rental car in downtown Lafayette, Louisiana. He wears a crisp blue shirt, a striped bowtie, and a pair of wire-rimmed glasses on top of his head. The Provosts’ case, he says, “is one of day versus night, right versus wrong … with practices that can only be described as practices out of darkness”.The family’s story is decades-long and mind-bending, accompanied by stacks of police reports, loan documents, foreclosure notices and legal petitions. The Provosts assert that white sugarcane farmers have been consistently offered more favorable loans and contracts by lenders and other agricultural entities than their black counterparts.A lawsuit filed on 21 September by attorneys for the Provosts allege that First Guaranty Bank treated June differently than similarly situated white borrowers – violating on eight counts the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), the Fair Housing Act, and Louisiana’s Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law.In a statement, First Guaranty Bank denies such allegations, calling them “completely unfounded and frivolous”, adding that it “has not and does not engage in discriminatory practices”.According to the lawsuit, the bank also required excessive collateral and unnecessarily supervised June’s farm spending account. The suit alleges that the bank forced him to reduce his sugarcane acreage against expert recommendations from Louisiana State University agronomists. First Guaranty Bank disputes this, arguing that “future loans to Provost were declined since his yields were too low to service the debt, and he defaulted on the prior loans”.The lawsuit also alleges that the bank unfairly delayed the approval and disbursement of loan funds for farm expenses, and vastly underfunded June’s annual crop loans, which impinged on his ability to produce a good crop.In 2008, June’s second season farming on his own, the sugarcane production cost was $615 per acre. But June was only loaned $194 per acre. After weeding and fertilizing, he had little left to repair or purchase equipment. By fall, he could barely afford to pay his workers, let alone plant new cane for future production.The Provosts argue that First Guaranty Bank and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved years of unfeasible loans that were too small for the scale of June’s production and dispersed too late in the season – and that when he failed, they collected on his collateral.Such lending discrimination, Angie argues, can be observed just by looking at the fields around south Louisiana. By summer, white farmers’ fields are well-drained, weed-free, laser-leveled, whereas black farmers’ fields are overrun with Johnsongrass, a noxious weed – visual proof, says Angie, that black farmers are provided fewer resources than white farmers.“You have to see it as a giant web, and every time you move in one way, it pulls you back in another,” says Hank Sanders, an attorney who is regularly involved in strategy with the Provosts’ legal team. “White supremacy is such a powerful thing … and it manifests itself in these various entities and institutions.”Now almost 76, Sanders was one of the primary lawyers for the plaintiffs in Pigford v Glickman, a groundbreaking lawsuit brought in 1997 against the USDA by black farmers alleging racial discrimination in federal farm assistance and lending. The Pigford case resulted in more than 15,000 claimants receiving compensation, including June, his brothers and Wenceslaus Sr. After Pigford, the 2008 farm bill and a 2010 vote by Congress led to the appropriation of $1.25bn for a settlement that included thousands of additional black farmers.The Pigford case illuminated the long, old wound of black farmland loss in America, which began with a broken promise by the federal government to give 40 acres and a mule to each family of emancipated slaves. While Abraham Lincoln envisioned the USDA as the “people’s department”, black farmers have another name for the agency: “the last plantation”.“The tactics are to strangle the life from all the black farmers, and it’s being done in multiple ways,” says Sanders. “And the US government is as much in on the strangling as any other entity … and has generally been complicit in running hundreds of thousands of black folks off the farm, and destroying their way of life.”When June couldn’t afford labor, he worked long days alone. His mother, Bernadette, says he did “the work of four and five men”. He’d pick up tractor tires or 50-gallon drums by himself and shovel drains by hand. He’d go to work at 3am just to get everything done.“There was always, ‘Mom, I don’t have enough money to do this,’” Bernadette says. “‘Look how long they’re taking with my loan. What am I going to do?’” Her voice breaks, and she begins to cry. “It seeped the life out of his body.”“Give up,” she told him.“Mama, I can’t, it’s my life.”In the lawsuit, lawyers for the family argue that First Guaranty Bank required far more collateral from the Provosts than similarly situated white farmers (an allegation the bank vehemently denies). The bank took lien positions on June’s personal residence, parents’ residence, farm equipment, farm payments from USDA, crops and the earnings from those crops, and equipment lease payments.In his years of representing black farmers, Sanders says he’s seen clear patterns used by government and private entities to disrupt their farming operations. “If you rob somebody on the street, that’s a crime that carries a prison term. But in this web, if you make a decision with your pencil and your paper, it’s robbery nonetheless.”In 2008, June struggled to make his crop loan stretch. He relied on old equipment that often needed to be repaired and couldn’t afford enough laborers to plant seed cane until November, three months later than guidelines which note a drastically smaller crop if not planted by the end of August.On 8 November, while chopping the ground for new cane, June could barely stay ahead of the planting crew with a single tractor, so his father came to help.“We can chop together,” Wenceslaus Sr told his son.That evening, they left the field in separate vehicles, Wenceslaus Sr a few minutes ahead. But when June started down Highway 90, he saw cars pulling over, the glow of taillights, a cloud of dust. Wenceslaus Sr had flipped his truck. By the time Angie arrived, June was holding his father in the middle of the road. She remembers that it was chilly and damp, that milling season had begun, that the air smelled like syrup.Wenceslaus Sr died in a single-car accident from a suspected heart attack. He was 66 he had endured two heart surgeries, diabetes, as well as a lifetime of hardships and discrimination.His grave is decorated with silk flowers, and the headstone is etched with a tractor and stalks of sugarcane. The cemetery lies in clear view of MA Patout \u0026amp Son sugar mill, which describes itself on its website as “the oldest family-owned and operated complete sugar mill in the United States”.Before it became MA Patout \u0026amp Son, the Patout ancestors operated a sugar plantation.“A plantation was a factory, an industry that used enslaved people to make a product to make a profit,” says a tour guide for the Whitney Plantation, now a slavery museum, located in a nearby parish. “People said there was brutality in cotton, but death in cane.”Built on the backs of slaves, the sugarcane industry buoyed the country’s early economy. Enslaved blacks were considered moveable real estate that could be mortgaged and sold. Men were referred to as “bucks”, women as “breeders”, and babies as “increase”. When sold, families were often separated. The forced labor of hand-cutting, grinding, and boiling cane was excruciating and dangerous. And there were brutal punishments, including execution.In antebellum Louisiana, as the Patouts grew their plantation, they also grew their slave holdings. Simeon Patout was a “rather substantial slave owner for the time”, wrote Michael G Wade in Sugar Dynasty: MA Patout \u0026amp Son, Ltd 1791-1993. Wade describes the buying and selling of slaves by Simeon and his wife Appoline – $1,600 paid for “Jenny and her four children, aged one to ten” $3,000 cash paid for a family of six $425 for 13-year-old Nancy.By 1860, the Patouts owned 107 slaves.More than a century later, the Patout family still owns the company, and, according to the website, elects board members “to fill the seats of their ancestors”. They also own three subsidiaries, including two other mills. The company reports a combined capacity for the three mills of 4.6m tons of cane per year.In a separate lawsuit, the Provosts allege that in early 2015, MA Patout \u0026amp Son breached a 2007 contract with June, which stipulated that June would mill his cane with MA Patout, and that MA Patout would harvest and mill the cane for an agreed-upon fee for a duration of 14 years.(The mill declined to comment, citing the pending litigation with the Provosts.)In the month before the mill was to close for the season, Randall Romero, CEO of MA Patout, sent a series of letters and emails to June, accusing him of hauling sugarcane to another mill – an allegation the Provosts deny. “In fact,” wrote Romero in a letter on 6 January, “we have pictures of your trucks delivering sugar cane to other factories”. He terminated June’s contract and offered a temporary agreement to finish the season, charging significantly more to harvest the crop. June had two choices: sign what he considered to be a coercive contract and get his cane harvested – or refuse to sign, lose the crop, and fight back legally.The family gathered to discuss June’s options. They all agreed: June should not sign. That decision meant leaving the cane to freeze in the field – a disgrace to any farm family and heartbreaking for June.Frantically, he attempted to cut the cane himself and filed an emergency lawsuit against MA Patout. The mill acquiesced by cutting 300 acres of June’s cane, but it left between 300 and 400 acres untouched. By then, it had stood so long in the field that it was barely viable. June estimates a crop value loss of over half a million dollars. He says it was the final blow that forced him out of farming.In a deposition on 28 November 2017, Romero stated that harvesting sugarcane just days before the closing of the mill – as was the case with June’s cane in 2015 – would be considered “impractical”, and would yield less sugar than if it were harvested earlier in the season. When asked if he agreed “that Provost Jr suffered damages as a result of MA Patout’s breach of contract”, Romero replied: “I’m sure he did.”He also admitted to singling out June Provost for surveillance based on a rumor that he was hauling sugarcane to another mill. In a signed 2018 affidavit, the MA Patout \u0026amp Son president, Jacques Hebert, submitted photographs of June’s trucks hauling sugarcane to Cajun Sugar Cooperative. The Provosts say it was Angie’s cane in the photos, not June’s, and that at the time she was farming independently of her husband as a separate legal business entity. In 2014, she had requested her own contract with MA Patout \u0026amp Son, but had been denied, so she milled her sugarcane elsewhere.A trial is set to begin in December.Before June came three generations of sugarcane farm owners: his great-grandfather, the first in the family to own land his grandfather, Frank, who bought 33 acres where the family built their houses and his parents, who, as Angie says, “built a legacy” for their family by acquiring land and becoming skilled sugarcane producers.Angie traces her ancestry to the coast of Cameroon, where her family members were stolen and sold as slaves to Louisiana’s sugar barons. Her great-great grandfather, Antoine, was enslaved at Oaklawn Manor, now the home of Louisiana’s former governor Mike Foster. Angie says it was winter when Antoine was freed, so he took “Winters” as his surname. He told his children that he spat on the ground as he left.“You don’t understand discrimination and oppression unless you’ve lived through it,” says Robinson, an attorney for the Provosts. His own family once owned hundreds of acres across Georgia’s kaolin clay belt, but a company convinced his nearly illiterate grandfather to sign documents that he couldn’t read and bought the land for a fraction of its value.“If you have not had dinner, supper, and lunch with oppression and poverty, then you might not want to fix it, because you can’t relate to it … but I don’t like looking at injustice and poverty and oppression, so I’m doing something about it.”To look at June is to witness how heartbreak can change a face. You can still see the boy who wanted more than anything to farm, but now there is a bone sadness – dejection in his voice, a near-constant furrowing of his brow when he reflects on his lost land. “You see the depression in June’s eyes,” says Robinson, “And you see the fight in Angie.”Indeed, Angie has become the family’s unofficial co-counsel, a fierce defender of the Provost legacy. She’ll hold court around the kitchen island for anyone who will listen – to the evidence they’ve pieced together, the binders of documents she’s compiled, every detail of the Provost story told with hairpin precision.When Angie moved back to New Iberia as an adult, near where she was born, she says the place resembled a “good old boys’ club”.There were different rules, racial segregation, and a corrupt hierarchy.In 2014, the Iberia parish sheriff, Louis Ackal, made national headlines after a 22-year-old black man, Victor White III, died in the custody of sheriff’s deputies. Ackal claimed the young man shot himself, even as he was handcuffed with his hands behind his back in the back of a patrol car.This “legacy of racial conspiracy”, which the New York Times described in a 2017 article about Ackal and New Iberia, is the backdrop for the Provosts’ allegations, and Robinson argues that modern day tactics used to set black farmers up to fail – such as the ones on display in the Pigford case – are the residue of Jim Crow.Bryan Stevenson, the legendary Alabama lawyer and creator of the Memorial for Peace and Justice, a national lynching memorial, said on WNYC’s On the Media: “people weren’t lynched just because they were accused of some violent crime. They were lynched because they were successful in business. They were lynched because they insisted on being treated fairly. When they asked for better wages as sharecroppers, they would be lynched … this violence was intended to sustain racial hierarchy”.It is not far-fetched, say the Provosts, that in a community so steeped in racism, in an industry that has long discriminated against black farmers, there could have been a concerted effort to remove June Provost from his land and livelihood.On the night of 25 September, Angie sent an email to friends and family. “My soul is in despair as I write this letter to confirm the loss of our home via a sheriff sale scheduled for tomorrow @ 10:00am.”The following morning, in the foreclosure sale, the Provosts’ home and surrounding acreage went to First Guaranty Bank, the sole bidder. June and Angie moved in next door with Bernadette, but her house is currently in foreclosure proceedings with MidSouth Bank.Soon, they say, they could be homeless.But Angie and June say they’ll continue to fight – to prove that the sale of their home was an illegal foreclosure based on years of discriminatory lending and fraud, to be reimbursed for damages, and ultimately to be able to farm again. They also want justice for other black sugarcane farmers and imagine the possibility of a class action lawsuit if others come forward.They note challenges, including the lack of legal representation available in black rural communities, and the frightening nature of pursuing legal action against largely white businesses with plenty of resources.“Our families are all ided. There are conflicts everywhere. These people bank on us staying ided,” says Angie. “Because if we actually came together and said what was really going on, there would be a revolution here.”Nearly every night, the dreams come. Sometimes June is checking the fields with his dad, or he’s watching the cane yellow and freeze all over again. He’s begun grinding his teeth and calling out in his sleep. Angie dreams that people are chasing her, and she routinely wakes up in a panic. Or she dreams of the children they won’t have since deciding it’s not safe to start a family, given the threats.Since the problems began with their land, Angie and June have experienced panic attacks, anemia, and chronic illness, and they see therapists for stress and depression. A couple of years ago, June was hospitalized for gastrointestinal bleeding. They keep a bag packed by the door in case they need to leave quickly, and they go everywhere together, even to the grocery store.The May sky over the cemetery is blue as a bird’s egg, and the sugar mill spreads across the horizon – jutting smokestacks, bright yellow scaffolding, a long sweep of gray buildings that Angie says includes old slave quarters renovated into the MA Patout \u0026amp Son offices. From inside the complex of the mill, a horn blows, long and low.There is a sheen of sweat on June’s face as he walks quietly toward his father’s grave. He points to rows of stone mausoleums decorated with flowers. “These are all black sugarcane farmers,” he says, and shakes his head. “Every one of them passed too young.”June stands at his father’s grave and weeps. “I miss him so much,” he says to Angie, “All he wanted was for his family to farm, his grandsons … it’s not fair how they did it. It’s not right.”Angie reaches up to touch his face. “It’s not fair at all, but we fix what’s not fair,” she says gently. “Look how you’re shining a light on your dad’s story. He would be so proud of you.”This story was supported by the Puffin Foundation and the Economic Hardship Reporting Project"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ce32a8067a7a42bbccf5954e17387f260f9d6d1/0_296_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23f040b92f814cdb75c38bf62e4cea1b","title":"bangladesh and myanmar agree to start rohingya repatriation in mid november","story":"Bangladesh and Myanmar to start returning refugees days after warning of continuing genocide against MuslimsBangladesh and Myanmar have agreed to start returning Rohingya refugees in November, less than a week after UN investigators warned that a genocide against the Muslim minority was continuing.More than 720,000 of Myanmar’s stateless Rohingya fled a brutal military crackdown in August last year, taking shelter in crowded camps in Bangladesh and bringing with them harrowing tales of rape, murder and arson in a military crackdown.Investigators have said senior Myanmar military officials should be prosecuted for genocide in Rakhine state, but the country has rejected these calls, insisting it was defending itself against militants.Myanmar and Bangladesh announced a large-scale repatriation plan in November 2017. But the process hit bureaucratic hurdles almost immediately and it failed to take off, as both sides blamed the other for the delay and rights groups warned returning the Rohingya to Myanmar would condemn them to further reprisals.Authorities in Buddhist-majority Myanmar say more than 100 displaced Rohingya have returned in recent months, but Bangladesh insists the official process has not commenced.“We are looking forward to starting the repatriation by mid-November,” the Bangladesh foreign secretary, Shahidul Haque, said on Tuesday after talks in Dhaka between officials from both countries.Myanmar’s permanent secretary of foreign affairs, Myint Thu, who attended the talks, said both sides agreed to a “very concrete” plan to start the process next month.“We have shown our political will, flexibility and accommodation in order to commence the repatriation at the earliest possible date,” he told reporters.Myanmar’s government has trumpeted every occasion where a Rohingya family has returned, though rights groups have questioned whether the refugees did so voluntarily.Many fear returning to Myanmar without guaranteed rights such as citizenship, access to healthcare and freedom of movement – rights that were denied to them long before last year’s crackdown.The pledge to begin returning the Rohingya comes just days after UN investigators warned of an “ongoing genocide” against the Muslim minority in Myanmar.Marzuki Darusman, the chairman of the UN fact-finding mission on Myanmar, said that beyond mass killings, the conflict included the ostracisation of the population, prevention of births, and widespread displacement in camps.The UN says the return of the Rohingya must be voluntary, and conducted in dignity and security.It carried out a survey of conditions in northern Rakhine state last month and reported “mistrust, fear of neighbouring communities and a sense of insecurity” in many areas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c745188f1cb0c82a36985cbd2a8a8bf83a2f623b/0_118_5132_3078/master/5132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c344dcaf947d3362739ceca0b48b2c6e","title":"canada glaciers yukon shrinking","story":"Glaciers in the Yukon territory are retreating even faster than expected in a warming climate, scientists warnScientists in Canada have warned that massive glaciers in the Yukon territory are shrinking even faster than would be expected from a warming climate – and bringing dramatic changes to the region.After a string of recent reports chronicling the demise of the ice fields, researchers hope that greater awareness will help the public better understand the rapid pace of climate change.The rate of warming in the north is double that of the average global temperature increase, concluded the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in its annual Arctic Report Card, which called the warming “unprecedented”.“The region is one of the hotspots for warming, which is something we’ve come to realize over the last 15 years,” said David Hik of Simon Fraser University. “The magnitude of the changes is dramatic.”In their recent State of the Mountains report published earlier in the summer, the Canadian Alpine Club found that the Saint Elias mountains – which  British Columbia, the Yukon and Alaska – are losing ice faster than the rest of the country.“When I first went to the St Elias range, it felt like time travel – into the past,” said Hik, who co-edited the report. “What we’re seeing now feels like time travel into the future. Because as the massive glaciers are retreating, they’re causing a complete reorganization of the environment.”The accelerating melt of the glacier has resulted in major shifts to water sources at lower elevations.In 2016, the meltwaters of the glacier shifted dramatically away from the Slims river, cutting off critical water supplies to Kluane Lake – a Unesco world heritage site. Since the ersion, water levels at the lake have dropped more than 6.6ft – stranding thousands of fish from their natural spawning rivers. Dust storms have begun to flare up along sections of the well-travelled Alaska Highway – at times halting traffic, the result of a dry river bed covered in glacial silt. The events at Kluane Lake are a precursor of what can be expected elsewhere, said Hik.The dramatic changes to the landscape come amid predictions that the Arctic region is slated to experience far quicker – and potentially devastating –warming in the coming years.In the St Elias range, researchers have found warming intensifies at higher altitudes – a phenomenon they are not quite able to explain.Earlier this year, Canada’s auditor general found that none of the three northern territories were adequately prepared for the impacts of climate change.But Robinson and Hik cautioned against an overly pessimistic view of the rapidly changing ecosystem.“Never before in human history have mountains been revered as they are today. Mountains are landscapes people adore – and with awareness, real change can be affected,” said Robinson.“When we have a an opportunity for early warning, we might as well take it,” said Hik."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3679782.1540835170!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"number of refused british applications for irish passports rises dramatically","story":"Speaking at meeting of foreign ministers in mid-October in Luxembourg, Tánaiste Simon Coveney called on the British government to follow through on commitments made in Brexit talks.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe number of applications from UK residents seeking Irish passports since Britain voted to leave the EU being turned down has risen dramatically.Passport applications from British residents being refused have soared from just one refusal in 2016 to at least 15,074 last year, according to latest figures.Overall hundreds of thousands of UK residents have applied for Irish passports since Britain voted for Brexit and the rate of applications continues to increase.The rise in requests for Irish passports from Northern Ireland is even greater than from Britain.Worldwide, the number of applications for Irish passports received from outside the State surged from 190,905 in 2016 to 227,223 last year and up to the end of September this year had hit 191,271, according to figures released to Social Democrat TD Catherine Murphy.Statistics supplied to Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond by the Irish Embassy in London show that the number of passport applications from the UK has risen significantly since the year before the Brexit vote.In 2015 there were almost 99,944 applications from Britain and Northern Ireland, a figure that rose to 131,035 the following year.In 2017 there was a further increase of over 30,000 applications to 163,026.And figures this year to the end of May show 91,860 applications were made.The number of people from the North who applied to the Irish Embassy in London for an Irish passport rose from 53,715 in 2015 to 67,582 the following year.Applications jumped again last year to 82,274 and up to the end of May this year 46,898 people in the North applied for Irish passports.“Embassy officials predict that based on this, 2018 will be the busiest year so far for Irish passport applications in the UK,” Mr Richmond said.People born to Irish parents or grandparents are entitled to apply for an Irish passport through a claim to citizenship.“At least 10 per cent of the UK’s population, not including Northern Ireland, are estimated to qualify for an Irish passport and in light of Brexit” many were “staking their claim” to the passport, Mr Richmond said.Tánaiste Simon Coveney told Ms Murphy in a parliamentary reply that the passport service did not compile data on the number of passport applications refused.However, Mr Coveney told her that in 2016 a total of 63,452 passports were issued by the Irish Embassy in London, one fewer than the number of applications diplomats told Mr Richmond it had received from Britain.The Tánaiste also said 65,678 Irish passports were issued through the embassy last year, some 15,074 less than the 80,752 applications from British residents.Mr Coveney pointed out that the passport service “must be satisfied as to the identity of the applicant and that the applicant is an Irish citizen”.Mr Richmond said that “while many in the UK are concerned with the looming disaster of Brexit, we must seize the positives from this new wave of people reconnecting with their Irish heritage, our post-Brexit UK-Irish relations can be built on a strong, connected diaspora”.In contrast, applications from the Irish diaspora elsewhere around the world have dropped slightly.Ms Murphy noted that the number of applications has fallen annually since 2016 in locations with significant Irish populations including New York, San Francisco and Boston in the US although there has been an increase in applications to the Chicago consulate from 1,126 in 2016 to 2,046 last year and 1,435 up to the end of September this year.Applications outside the EU are also falling including those from Canada, New Zealand, Australia, United Arab Emirates, China and Japan.In Africa, applications from Nigeria, Mozambique, Uganda, and Tanzania have also fallen. In Kenya, there were no applications in 2016 or last year but four this year."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3680419.1540889926!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"peter casey offered renua leadership after fianna f%C3%A1il rejects him","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeter Casey has threated to set up a new party called New Fianna Fáil. Photograph: PAThe leader of Renua has said the party is going to reach out to Peter Casey in the coming days about joining the party.However, Councillor John Leahy, Renua’s sole elected public representative said he would not stand in the way of Mr Casey taking over his party.Renua was founded by former minister of state for European affairs Lucinda Creighton in 2015. She lost her Dáil seat in the 2016 General Election, having forfeited both her ministerial office and parliamentary party membership when she defied Fine Gael on abortion legislation in July 2013.Mr Leahy said he had secured the contact details of the Derry businessman and hopes to meet him.“I think Peter is very much in line to our way of thinking in terms of a lot of our core policies. Taxpayer first, entrepreneurship, and law and order would be three of our six pillars,” Mr Leahy said.Mr Casey finished second in the presidential race, securing 23 per cent of first preference votes, following a series of controversial comments on the travelling community.Mr Leahy said the leadership of his party is “open to be contested”.“It’s not a closed shop in Renua, we’re a small, growing party so from that point of view I’ve no problem with anybody stepping up to the mark that thinks they can take up the leadership and drive the party forward.”Mr Casey said on Monday that if Fianna Fáil did not want him as a member he would set up a new party called New Fianna Fáil.Meanwhile, Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairman Sean Fleming has said that Fianna Fáil is a democratic party, not a business that someone can “move in and take over the top job.”Mr Fleming told Newstalk Breakfast that none of the main political parties is a business that can be taken over by a person. Such an approach and language was for business, “politics doesn’t work that way.”Fianna Fáil will have to look at the 340,000 people who had voted for Peter Casey, Mr Fleming said. “There was a vacuum here. I’m quite sure had there been someone standing for the main political parties, those 340,000 would not have voted for Peter Casey.”He defended the party’s decision not to run a candidate in the presidential election. “Micheál Martin made a clear decision. Michael D was doing an excellent job and from that point of view that was a correct decision.”Mr Fleming also defended the PAC’s decision to examine Áras spending every year. This was not a reflection on the President, he said. There are “lots of issues that need to be dealt with.”Senior civil servants will be asked to account for the money that is being spent in the Áras and on the office of the President. The PAC did not “step over the line. We should have been doing this every year.”Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177653497_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc legal correspondent wrong say nda signed freely","story":"BBC legal correspondent criticised for saying NDA was signed freely Court of AppealThe BBC has been told it is “inaccurate” to claim that women who entered into non-disclosure agreements after they had made allegations about sexual harassment did so “freely”.Media and employment lawyers have said it is likely there would be an “imbalance of power” during negotiations to settle a claim and therefore it was incorrect to view these contractual relationships as free of “abuse”.Yesterday, a BBC journalist claimed the judgment by the Court of Appeal “made clear that there was no evidence any of the NDAs resulted from bullying, harassment or undue pressure”.

china us champions trade aid race invest africa","story":"The new US embassy in LondonAmerica looks set to unveil a new trade-oriented Africa policy which will champion US corporate investment over conventional development aid.The move reflects concern in Washington that the west risks being outgunned by China in terms of direct investment on the rapidly developing continent.While the US remains the single biggest investor in Africa by some margin, China is catching up fast has become dominant in the area of large scale infrastructure.London and Paris, with which Washington is working closely, have both said they will increase direct investment in Africa in recent months.Speaking in London, Mr Tibor Nagy, the newly appointed US assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said he had become frustrated with the way some African countries had become dependent on aid and that US policy would now seek to promote a “journey to self reliance”.“There is not enough development money in the world to lead Africa to development but there is certainly enough foreign direct investment to do the same thing”, he said.President Donald Trump recently approved the Better Utilisation of Investments Leading to Development Act (Build), legislation that will double, to $60 billion, funds for promoting US corporate investment in Africa.Following China\u0027s lead, the Act will also enable a newly created US government agency to take a direct equity stake of its own in development projects in Africa for the first time.Defusing the \u0026#039demographic timebomb\u0026#039 | Global population issuesCritics say that while the move is welcome the sums involved are not enough and are still dwarfed by new Chinese investment planned for Africa.Mr Nagy, an old Africa hand whose triplets were the first to be born in Zimbabwe after its independence in 1980, said the next 30 years would be pivotal for Africa as its population was set to nearly double to 2.5 billion by 2050.“There will be millions and millions of young people”, he said.Addressing the challenge posed by China in Africa, Mr Nagy said it would be wrong to cast it in the same good-guy-bad-guy light that characterised much western investment there during the cold war investment that fueled conflict and sowed the seeds of continent’s later debt crisis.“I certainly can’t blame African states that there are so many Chinese companies involved there”, he said. “When there was a knock on the door and they opened it, it was only the Chinese that were standing there.“I’d like to make sure that the next time there is a knock on the door it is more than the Chinese standing there… I would like to see US companies standing there.”Nevertheless, Mr Nagy said China’s lending to Africa could threaten a new debt trap one that could result in countries having to surrender strategic assets such as ports and airports to China unless they were able to keep up repayments.He also made clear the US would not hide its light under a bushel when it came to promoting the merits of US corporate investment over Chinese competition in Africa.“Our companies maintain different standards”, he said, “different labour standards, different environmental standards.“The trees don\u0027t disappear. The wildlife does not disappear. And everybody beyond the rank of turning a shovel doesn\u0027t come from the US to do that job... Oh, and by the way, we don\u0027t leave the country billions of dollars in debt.”Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Brexit latest: Norway rejects EEA model as solution to Irish border impasse- live updatesHow Donald Trump\u0026#39s base is hurting from his trade wars but sticking with their man French Navy helped by 250 albatrosses fitted with beacons to detect illegal fishing trawlersComment: We must not be enslaved by the OBR\u0026#39s anti-Brexit instinctsComment: Our immigration system must be self-funded and sustainable post-BrexitSuzy Lamplugh murder: Officers dig up suspect\u0026#39s old garden as convicted killer nears prison release dateComment: This Budget does little to increase the attractiveness of post-Brexit BritainComment: Philip Hammond plans to help Chequers pass by stuffing its critics\u0026#39 mouths with goldSeal colony faced \u0026#39worst ever year\u0026#39 for injuries caused by rubbish, environmentalists revealGeoffrey Rush would \u0026#39look at me and lick his lips\u0026#39, actress at centre of defamation case tells courtPhilip Hammond has \u0026#39abandoned\u0026#39 commitment to wiping out deficit by mid-2020s, IFS director saysBritish woman faces death sentence after being charged with murder of her expat husband in MalaysiaDeath toll in Italy storms rises to nine, as tourists are barred from flooded St. Mark\u0026#39s Square in VeniceComment: Philip Hammond has let spending rip just as the world teeters on the brink of crisisJamal Khashoggi\u0026#39s fiancée hits out at Donald Trump and calls on western leaders not to allow a cover-up over his killingSurgery students \u0026#39can\u0026#39t sew or cut\u0026#39 because they spend too much time on screens, warns Imperial College professorTwo households, both alike: Is the court of Wills and Harry iding?Inside San Pedro Sula, the corrupt, cartel-infested birth place of the migrant caravanWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000179398168_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZgEkZX3M936N5BQK4Va8RUbgHFEZVI1Pljic_pW9c90.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"geoffrey rush would look lick lips actress centre defamation","story":"Actress Eryn Jean Norvill leaves the Federal Court in Sydney on TuesdayOscar-winner Geoffrey Rush touched his co-star on the breast and humiliated her with sexual innuendo during a production of King Lear, the co-star told an Australian court on Tuesday, as News Corp defended publishing some details of her claims.In Australia\u0027s first defamation case of the #MeToo era, Rush is suing News Corp\u0027s Australian arm over a series of articles saying he was the subject of a complaint to the Sydney Theatre Company regarding the 2015 Lear production.Under the headline KING LEER, and in later articles, Sydney\u0027s Daily  newspaper said last year that the actor, in the title role, had been accused by a co-star of unspecified inappropriate conduct.The articles did not name the accuser nor detail the conduct, but the female actor, Eryn Jean Norvill, who played Lear\u0027s daughter Cordelia, was called to give evidence by News Corp which stands by the stories.Rush, 67, a star of Australian theatre who won the Best Actor Oscar in 1997 for Shine and has since appeared in the Pirates of the Caribbean films, has denied any improper conduct.But Norvill, her voice at times breaking with emotion, said Rush constantly behaved inappropriately toward her and other women in the play, as she gave evidence at the Federal Court in Sydney.He would look at me and smile and cup his two hands, and lick his lips, raise his eyebrows, bulge out his eyes, sometimes he\u0027d, like, growl, Norvill said.Actor Geoffrey Rush arrives at the Federal Court with his legal team on October 23 In one rehearsal, when she was playing dead in a climactic scene, Norvill said she opened her eyes to discover Rush simulating groping her breasts. In a performance of the scene, she said Rush stroked her right breast slowly with his fingers.It didn\u0027t feel like an accident, she said, adding that his behaviour made her feel humiliated, belittled and put her on high alert around Rush whom she had previously idolised.She did not confront him at the time, she said, because she was at the bottom of the rung in terms of hierarchy and Geoffrey was definitely at the top and that was in play.Rush has previously told the court that the \u0027s stories implied he was a major pervert, or guilty of major depravity, and did not fit his recollection of the production.A spokeswoman at Shanahan, Rush\u0027s management firm in Sydney, declined to comment.Earlier in court, Rush\u0027s lawyer argued the story was only pursued because the  wanted an Australian angle on the accusations levelled at US film producer Harvey Weinstein that sparked the #MeToo movement.Hundreds of women have since accused powerful men of sexual harassment and abuse. Rush\u0027s lawyer said the articles destroyed his career and he would seek very substantial damages, though it is not clear how much he could claim if he wins.Brexit latest: Norway rejects EEA model

GardenClick to followThe Independent TechApple is preparing for one of its biggest events of the year, during which it will introduce a huge suite of new products.The launch comes just weeks after the release of the iPhone XS and XR, where the Apple Watch was also updated, and serves to tweak all of the products that got left out of that event. So at the very least there will be new iPads and Macs – and there might be extra surprises, too.Leaks so far have focused on a new iPad\u0026nbspPro, with a new Apple Pencil, which will borrow the design of the iPhone X. As such there\u0027ll be no home button, and the Face ID facial recognition tools, as well as the removal or reduction of the bezel that usually frames the screen.And there will be at least one Mac, it seems. Rumours suggest that Apple will offer something new to take up the position the MacBook Air currently fills in the line-up: the cheaper, more resilient version of its laptops, but finally updating them for recent features.Everything kicks off at 10am\u0026nbsplocal time in New York, where Apple is unusually holding the event. Because of the strange situation of timezones – the UK is out of summer time, but the US isn\u0027t yet – that is 2pm in London.Apple is holding its October event in New York this year. Leaving California is a strange decision, especially when the company relatively recently opened the Steve Jobs Theater that was built specifically for this kind of launch. But it\u0027s probably doing so because of the venue: the Brooklyn Academy of Music. That has a beautiful, old theatre, and is presumably part of an effort to emphasise creativity that is also in keeping with the iPad Pro and the unique Apple-themed invites that were created for each invitee.\u0026nbspTo add to the weirdness, the timings are all a little strange. In part that\u0027s because of the location – the timezone means that everything will be happening earlier than usual, when it\u0027s held on the West Coast – but also because the US is still in summer time when the UK isn\u0027t, meaning the gap is only four hours compared to the usual five.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Bitcoins can only come into existence if a computer “mines” them, which means the computer must solve complex math equations, sucking up electricity. Part of the economic draw of Bitcoin is that it cannot be produced easily or cheaply, meaning it is unlikely that it will be mined so quickly that it loses value. There is also a cap on Bitcoin production: there will only be 21 million in total.Mining one bitcoin “could take as much energy in that transaction to power your house for months”, said Jon Truby, Director of the Centre for Law and Development at Qatar University. “Right now, that’s not sustainable.”It is hard to predict the future of Bitcoin: it is highly volatile and is sometimes worth less than the amount of money it costs to mine. The difficulty of the equation that the computer has to solve can also make mining bitcoins take more energy. Many economists suggests that the value will increase, and it is possible that technology could also improve mining efficiency in the future. Some argue that cash is also environmentally destructive.Alternatively, maybe mining Bitcoins will eventually become more efficient and use less energy. “The mining efficiency has been improving quite a lot,” Camilo Mora, lead author of the study, said. “That is because you make more money there. That is something that the mining companies have tried to push hard.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rescue team members collecting the remains of the crashed plane at Tanjung Priok Harbour, Indonesia.

BP said it expected to complete the $10.5bn acquisition this week.\u0026nbspBP is still paying out for the Deepwater Horizon disaster - the most destructive marine oil spill ever - with after-tax costs of $500m this quarter.Deepwater Horizon wellhead in the Gulf of Mexico (Getty)The April 2010 explosion on a rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 people and resulted in a record $18.7bn environmental fine from US authorities. BP said it expected payments related to the disaster would be around $3bn.Chief executive Bob Dudley said: “Our focus on safe and reliable operations and delivering our strategy is driving strong earnings and growing cash flow.“Operations are running well across BP and we\u0027re bringing new, higher-margin barrels into production faster through efficient project execution.”Mr Dudley said the shale acquisition would transform BP’s position in the US and “create significant value” for BP. This progress all underpins our commitment to growing distributions for our shareholders,“ he said.BP\u0027s averaged 3.6 million barrels of oil per day over the quarter.Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: Growth in renewable energy and the introduction of electric cars may be long-term worries for investors.But as profits gush and cash flows, the here and now looks pretty rosy for BP.”However, oil prices slipped on Tuesday, as concerns grew that a trade dispute between the US and China could hurt economic growth.Signs have also emerged that global supply is increasing, despite US sanctions against Iran, the world\u0027s fifth-largest producer of oil.Brent crude was down 15 cents a barrel at $77.19 on Wednesday morning while US\u0026nbsplight was unchanged at $67.04.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The policy was explained “for the convenience of the house”, but Mr Hammond said he didn’t want to get “bogged down” in the detail.Jeremy Corbyn had a problem replying to, in effect, a Labour BudgetTax Calculator: see what today’s Budget means for your moneyWhat are the new economic forecasts and is austerity over?Chancellor ploughs extra £1bn into troubled universal creditThis is how Britain\u0027s austerity plans compare to the rest of the worldReducing business rates\u0026nbspwill give independent shops some much-needed breathing space and allow them to invest in their staff and stores said Jo Causon, chief executive of The Institute of Customer Service.“However, more still needs to be done to help the high street continue to be a place where communities come together, she added.“In an increasingly fragmented world, it is critical that consumers have choice and for many, it means their brand of choice needs a high street presence.”Pub landlords welcomed a freeze in alcohol duty which amounts to a saving of 2p on a pint of beer, 1p on a pint of cider and a 30p on a bottle of scotch or gin.\u0026nbsp“This early Christmas present will save brewers, pubs and pub-goers £110m and secure upwards of 3,000 jobs that would have been lost had beer duty gone up,” Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer \u0026amp Pub Association, said.Tax on wine will rise in line with inflation from February which will increase the price of a bottle by 7p on still wines and by an extra 9p on sparkling and fortified wine, the industry’s trade body estimated.The Wine and Spirits Trade Association (WSTA) described the decision as “grossly unfair, unjustified and counter-productive”.Chief executive Miles Beale said wine has been the most lucrative alcoholic drink for the Treasury since it overtook beer in 2012.“The UK is the world\u0027s biggest wine trading nation and, as such, deserves the Government\u0027s support, not punishment,” he said.He added: “By increasing the UK\u0027s already excessive duty rates the Chancellor will clobber wine importing businesses - including thousands of small and medium enterprises - stifle growth of our flourishing English wine industry and raise prices for consumers.”Super-strength low cost “white cider” was also excluded from the duty freeze but will instead by the subject of a new rate of tax from October next year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s\u0026nbsptime to change that to Dreaming Phil.Hammond’s dream is that his Government will somehow find a way of securing a Brexit deal that it can get through Parliament. If it can, his latest budget will count for something. If not we’ll be back here again in April, a\u0026nbsppossibility he alluded to in his speech.\u0026nbspAccording to the bookies he clobbered with an increase in the remote gaming levy, it’s still a toss up.\u0026nbspHammond’s Budget was anti-business and anti-opportunityChancellor ploughs extra £1bn into troubled universal creditHammond takes aim at Amazon, Google and Facebook with new tech taxThe Chancellor indulged in the usual waffle about building a new relationship with the EU we’ve come to expect from ministers.\u0026nbspBut he chucked a few extra hundred million on to rapidly growing contingency planning pile, acknowledging that the worst is becoming a distinct possibility.\u0026nbspAnd if that happens, “the strivers, the grafters and the carers” the “people who ask only of government that we protect the jobs that put food on their table” and look after the “public services that they rely on”\u0026nbsp are going to have some hard questions for him, such as “what did you do to prevent this other than issue warnings so you could say I told you so”.\u0026nbspEven if a deal is done, and his\u0026nbsp”double deal idend”\u0026nbspbudget stands, the forecasts are\u0026nbsphardly rosy.\u0026nbspPrime Minister Theresa May said austerity is over. The Chancellor’s formulation was a mite more cautious. It is, he said, “coming to an end”.\u0026nbspThat’s understandable given the outlook he faces. This year the economy is set to\u0026nbspgrow by just 1.3 per cent, if\u0026nbspthe Office for\u0026nbspBudgetary Responsibility has it right.\u0026nbspIts assessment of UK plc’s potential further out has improved\u0026nbspa bit but we’ll still be averaging growth of only 1.5 per cent.\u0026nbspIn its view, Britain will be stuck in the slow lane for the foreseeable future, even with the benefit of the fiscal loosening the Chancellor is planning. All his talk of ambition and the bright future for the “indomitable” British people\u0026nbspwon’t change that.\u0026nbspIn the meantime he confirmed that there will be some bones thrown and some sticking plasters applied. The NHS will get its extra money, but when set against what it needs\u0026nbspit’s only the bare minimum. There’ll be a few less potholes in the roads, thanks to the £400m or so set aside to fix them, a bit extra support for those facing the nightmare of Universal Credit. That carbuncle, a project that is turning into the Poll Tax for this generation of Tories, is here to stay, he declared. That may come back to haunt him.\u0026nbspThe Tories’ traditional supporters will cheer his bringing forward a tax cut, which is what the changes to the personal allowance and the top rate threshold planned for 2019 amount to.\u0026nbspAnd while Boris Johnson might have said ‘f- business’, the Chancellor wants to be its friend.\u0026nbspThe Institute of Directors, for one, gave its thumbs up to business rate relief for small firms, cuts to their apprenticeship levy, investment incentives, more funding for City deals.\u0026nbsp“But will there be support for SME Brexit planning,” it said archly, while criticising the Chancellor for “pulling his\u0026nbsppunches”.\u0026nbspThere were some good bits the commitment to end the private finance initiative in particular. The narrowly targeted digital services tax (aimed at Facebook, Google and their silicon valley pals) even looked bold, until the critics got their teeth into the details. The £400m it will supposedly raise is ho hum indeed.\u0026nbspIn his opening Hammond talked about the concerns of the people away from the Westminster bubble, who care about putting food on the table, clothing their children, running their lives.\u0026nbspHe boasted of the strongest wage growth in a decade, and the sustained real wage growth forecast for each of the next five years, that ought to\u0026nbspmake life better for them.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

BP said it expected to complete the $10.5bn acquisition this week.\u0026nbspBP is still paying out for the Deepwater Horizon disaster - the most destructive marine oil spill ever - with after-tax costs of $500m this quarter.Deepwater Horizon wellhead in the Gulf of Mexico (Getty)The April 2010 explosion on a rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 people and resulted in a record $18.7bn environmental fine from US authorities. BP said it expected payments related to the disaster would be around $3bn.Chief executive Bob Dudley said: “Our focus on safe and reliable operations and delivering our strategy is driving strong earnings and growing cash flow.“Operations are running well across BP and we\u0027re bringing new, higher-margin barrels into production faster through efficient project execution.”Mr Dudley said the shale acquisition would transform BP’s position in the US and “create significant value” for BP. This progress all underpins our commitment to growing distributions for our shareholders,“ he said.BP\u0027s averaged 3.6 million barrels of oil per day over the quarter.Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: Growth in renewable energy and the introduction of electric cars may be long-term worries for investors.But as profits gush and cash flows, the here and now looks pretty rosy for BP.”However, oil prices slipped on Tuesday, as concerns grew that a trade dispute between the US and China could hurt economic growth.Signs have also emerged that global supply is increasing, despite US sanctions against Iran, the world\u0027s fifth-largest producer of oil.Brent crude was down 15 cents a barrel at $77.19 on Wednesday morning while US\u0026nbsplight was unchanged at $67.04.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The policy was explained “for the convenience of the house”, but Mr Hammond said he didn’t want to get “bogged down” in the detail.Jeremy Corbyn had a problem replying to, in effect, a Labour BudgetTax Calculator: see what today’s Budget means for your moneyWhat are the new economic forecasts and is austerity over?Chancellor ploughs extra £1bn into troubled universal creditThis is how Britain\u0027s austerity plans compare to the rest of the worldReducing business rates\u0026nbspwill give independent shops some much-needed breathing space and allow them to invest in their staff and stores said Jo Causon, chief executive of The Institute of Customer Service.“However, more still needs to be done to help the high street continue to be a place where communities come together, she added.“In an increasingly fragmented world, it is critical that consumers have choice and for many, it means their brand of choice needs a high street presence.”Pub landlords welcomed a freeze in alcohol duty which amounts to a saving of 2p on a pint of beer, 1p on a pint of cider and a 30p on a bottle of scotch or gin.\u0026nbsp“This early Christmas present will save brewers, pubs and pub-goers £110m and secure upwards of 3,000 jobs that would have been lost had beer duty gone up,” Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer \u0026amp Pub Association, said.Tax on wine will rise in line with inflation from February which will increase the price of a bottle by 7p on still wines and by an extra 9p on sparkling and fortified wine, the industry’s trade body estimated.The Wine and Spirits Trade Association (WSTA) described the decision as “grossly unfair, unjustified and counter-productive”.Chief executive Miles Beale said wine has been the most lucrative alcoholic drink for the Treasury since it overtook beer in 2012.“The UK is the world\u0027s biggest wine trading nation and, as such, deserves the Government\u0027s support, not punishment,” he said.He added: “By increasing the UK\u0027s already excessive duty rates the Chancellor will clobber wine importing businesses - including thousands of small and medium enterprises - stifle growth of our flourishing English wine industry and raise prices for consumers.”Super-strength low cost “white cider” was also excluded from the duty freeze but will instead by the subject of a new rate of tax from October next year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Players can get the ability to move around more quickly or to see in the dark, for instance.As well as being able to play in teams – either with strangers or people you know – each player is given personal awards depending on how they\u0027ve done.Special technologies had to be built to allow for the first multiplayer version of the game, Google said. The team built several systems to enable this multiplayer gaming, all running on the Google Cloud Platform, including integrating Open Match, a highly-scalable, open source matchmaking framework cofounded by Google Cloud and Unity, it wrote in a blog post announcing the new game.The Doodle is showing around almost all of the world – though not in Africa and some specific countries – and will presumably stick around until Halloween is over.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the year“We’re blockchain enthusiasts,” Sirin\u0026nbspLabs’ chief marketing officer Nimrod May told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspin July when the Finney phone was first announced.“We want this phone to make all the benefits of blockchain technology available to as big an audience as possible, while making cryptocurrency accessible to the mainstream.”The phone comes with an inbuilt\u0026nbspcryptocurrency wallet, which can be viewed on a hidden screen that\u0026nbspslides out from behind the main display.

After a significant amount of time discussing a wide range of issues, Messi saw the power, professionalism and future within Sirin\u0026nbspLabs, and it was for these reasons he agreed to represent us to the masses.”Given the fact some celebrity backers of cryptocurrency-related products have resulted in scams, Sirin\u0026nbspLabs was keen to stress that this is not the case with Messi.“If you’ve followed Messi’s career at all, you’d know he doesn’t just put his name on anything to make a buck,” the post continued.\u0026nbsp“As the Greatest of All Time (GOAT) in the most popular sport in the world, you can imagine the type of vetting process that he and his team have to ensure they’re not going to associate with something criminal, illicit, or anything that might tarnish his stellar brand.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Because the company has managed to slice off some more of the bezel around the display, it is the biggest screen in a OnePlus phone but takes up less space on the front.OnePlus forced to change 6T release date because of Apple eventThe biggest new breakthrough is probably the Screen Unlock feature. That works like the fingerprint sensor on many other phones – but it is placed right beneath the screen. OnePlus\u0026nbspsaid it will be able to unlock in just 0.34 seconds, despite being hidden.As well as that feature, it includes a new processor, RAM boost and special software that the company claims will speed up apps. It also has a battery that provides a 20 per cent increase on the OnePlus 6, which can use its fast charging feature.The camera is also improved to include features such as Nightscape, which it claims can take much improved pictures in the dark.OnePlus hopes the latest phone can finally allow it to break into the mainstream. Alongside updates to the phones, it will also be available more widely than ever before, as exclusivity deals have been lifted to allow it to be sold on different networks and shops.The cheapest version of the phone will be sold for £499, with the price increasing to £579 for extra storage space.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Jack even mentioned it in front of the US Congress. There\u0027s no timeline.

People including Kanye West have suggested that those numbers should be hidden entirely – a move that Mr Dorsey\u0026nbspdid not seem to reject.But it has been repeatedly criticised for failing to address some of its more central problems, including from users who believe it should be acting to ban people from the platform rather than\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was in complete bad taste and was not funny nor entertaining.\u0026nbsp“The police have confirmed that they are treating this as a hate crime and rightly so. Nobody within our community should live in fear or intimidation from a group of people who through this action have offered nothing but that.\u0026nbsp“The Muslim community are contributing much to society in Northern Ireland. Everyone has the right to live here. I would ask the public to bring information forward to the police.”The photos were also called “unacceptable” and “disgusting” by\u0026nbspKellie\u0026nbspArmstrong, an Alliance MLA for the\u0026nbspStrangford\u0026nbsparea.“Everyone knows the history of the Ku Klux Klan,” she told the\u0026nbspBelfast , “what they stood for, the crimes the organisation committed and the connotations these outfits convey. This was not a mistake or an unfortunate choice of outfits.“It is not appreciated by our community, it is not funny and it should definitely not be treated as a joke.”The PSNI said the group’s presence in the area was reported to them after 5pm on Sunday evening, and that they are treating this incident as a hate crime.In a statement, Inspector Richard Murray said, “We are also aware of images that are circulating that show people dressed as Ku Klux Klan members.“Our enquiries are ongoing, and we are treating this as a hate incident at this time.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In those circumstances, I suggested the EU should begin preparatory work on the extension of Article 50.“Because what would not be a good thing in my view is if we managed to get a referendum but it was too late because we had left the EU or the EU had not made preparations for an Article 50 extension.”Mr Khan added: “Whatever Theresa May brings back will probably be rejected by cabinet, almost certainly rejected by the party, and if not will definitely be rejected by parliament.“That’s why I said to Michel Barnier: listen, you need to start preparing for the possibility of extending Article 50 because if that is the case we will need time to have a referendum.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, tough times are far from over.”It warned that, after other spending protections for defence and foreign aid, the plan\u0026nbsp“probably means more cuts for other departments”.And the Child Poverty Action Group seized on the failure to end the four-year freeze on family benefits – cuts in real terms – as proof there was no “substance to the claim that austerity is over”.Created with Sketch.Tories at war: Boris Johnson \u0027suicide vest\u0027 Brexit jibe causes ide Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Internal isions in the Conservative Party have exploded into a bitter public row over Boris Johnson‘s “disgusting” criticism of Theresa May.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, rebuked his former cabinet colleague and said: “I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences.”But other MPs leapt to Mr Johnson’s defence, as iding lines ahead of a possible leadership contest begin to take shape.

A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.The socialist group, officially known as the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in Europe, was the largest group in the European Parliament in all elections until 1999, when it was eclipsed by the centre-right.In July speaking in the Netherlands Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told a congress of Labour’s sister parties that they risked looking like another part of the establishment by “supporting a failed economic system rigged for the wealthy”.He warned that “fake populists and migrant-baiters of the far-right” would benefit from the demise of the centre-left, which had in the past “delivered enormous advances for working people” but was now losing ground.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That would not be in the national interest.”Some observers believe that the Budget announced by Philip Hammond on Monday resembled a pre-election budget, with accelerated income tax cuts and some other popular measures.Fresh elections could be tempting because the Prime Minister lacks a majority in the House of Commons, meaning there is a good chance any Brexit deal she negotiates could be voted down.Though she secured the support of the right-wing\u0026nbspDUP with an extra £1 billion for Northern Ireland after the 2017 election, the party has since said it would not vote for an emerging deal that treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK.But with the Conservatives yet to open up a\u0026nbspsubstantial lead in the polls – and memories of last year’s shock result still fresh –\u0026nbspthe PM appears yet to be tempted.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

That would not be in the national interest.\u0027\u0027\u0026nbspEfforts to help survivors of the Grenfell fire received nothing in the Budget, despite a reported plea for up to £60m in extra funding.A Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) source told the Press Association\u0026nbspthe money was needed for health support, housing and refurbishment of the Lancaster West estate.It is in contrast to last year\u0027s Budget when £28 million in central government funding was granted to help pay for mental health and counselling services and regeneration in the west London neighbourhood.The fire at the 24-storey block in June 2017 left 71 dead, hundreds homeless and many more requiring support for trauma.RBKC\u0027s draft Grenfell Recovery Strategy was published this summer, and laid out a framework up to 2027 to help survivors and the bereaved and rebuild trust within the community.A financial breakdown of the strategy was not included in the draft report, but it said: The council cannot resource the recovery alone and will need to seek support from partners, including central Government.Elizabeth Campbell, RBKC council leader, said in response to Monday\u0027s budget: We will continue to ask for financial support for our communities, and we hope discussions will continue.The Grenfell recovery needs to be a long-term commitment, with sufficient resources in place to deliver it.A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: Our main priority is to make sure that the survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire receive the support they need.That is why we announced we will take responsibility for the Grenfell Tower site, making operational decisions until its future has been determined by the community.We are in discussions with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council about the future funding of the Grenfell Tower site.Philip Hammond‘s income tax cuts will “overwhelmingly benefit richer households” as the squeeze continues for lower-income families, according to one of the first independent analyses of the Budget.The verdict from the\u0026nbspResolution Foundation\u0026nbspcomes after the chancellor declared “austerity\u0026nbspis coming to an end” as he unveiled his Budget, providing billions in extra cash\u0026nbspfor universal credit and the NHS while he setting out a cut in income tax.\u0026nbspMore here:Philip Hammond also appeared on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain, where he told presenters he was happy with his job - after he was handed a mug reading prime minister.\u0026nbspAsked if the giveaway Budget was designed to pave the way for a general election, he said: I hope not. What we are preparing for is Britain\u0027s future.Philip Hammond has been all over the airwaves this morning, defending yesterday\u0027s Budget, which seems to have received a pretty positive response from many papers.Here\u0027s some highlights:He told the Today programme that the deficit will decline in every year of the forecast period, and he retained an ambition to balance the budget.Asked if some government departments faced cuts in the coming years, Mr Hammond said: The overall envelope of funding that\u0027s available in the spending review, once you take out the commitment we\u0027ve made to health, gives flat real spending available for all other departments.Pressed on whether that meant some departments would be hit by cuts, he replied: That\u0027s a choice that we make, isn\u0027t it?You do have a choice of everybody having 0.0 per cent\u0026nbspreal, in other words maintaining their spending power in real terms after inflation year after year after year.Mr Hammond said he expected a deal to be agreed with the EU but warned that a no-deal Brexit could be a shock to the economy.He said: If the economy suffers a shock - and a no-deal Brexit is an example of a shock, but actually we know from history that sometimes the shocks that hit the economy are not the ones we are expecting but ones we aren\u0027t expecting - if there\u0027s a shock to the economy, we will deal with it in the usual way.Very often a shock to the economy actually requires a boost to spending in the short term to support demand and to keep the economy going.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s politics liveblog, where we will be bringing you all the latest updates throughout the day.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But I’m happy to tell Sun on Sunday readers that their hard work is paying off.Our jobs market has defied many of the naysayers.Near record numbers of people have a job and unemployment has fallen in every region across the country.There are more than .million additional people in work since .While this is a huge achievement, sometimes it’s easy to forget that behind these numbers are thousands of people up and down our country who are now better able to provide for their families.They can get up every morning knowing they have the security that only a job can bring.And what’s more, they are being rewarded with a pay rise — this month’s figures show the strongest wage growth in almost a decade.Contrary to myths peddled by the opposition, it’s people at the bottom of the pay scale who have benefited most.The lowest earners working full-time have seen the fastest rise in pay thanks to our National Living Wage and the proportion of low-paid jobs is at a record low.Tomorrow I will deliver my Budget, where I will show how our careful focus on fixing the economy is bearing fruit.Thanks to the balanced approach we have taken — getting our debt falling, while keeping taxes low — and the hard work of the people of the UK, I will be able to set out how we will be investing in our future.Much of the talk surrounding Budgets is often technical. Many, many experts and commentators will have their own take on how the economy is doing.While this is, of course, important, what most ordinary people really care about is how the Budget will improve their day-to-day lives.And one of the issues which I know Sun on Sunday readers care a lot about is transport. With a thousand more people moving into work every day, it’s important that we help to get them there on time.Many of you preparing to start the working week tomorrow will know the frustration of having your journey to work ruined by delays caused by poorly maintained roads. Or of having your car or van damaged by potholes.This isn’t just a bad way to start the day, it’s bad for businesses large and small, and it can be really damaging to the wider economy as well.It’s estimated that congestion costs UK households more than £billion every year. That’s why tomorrow I will announce a bumper £billion investment in our country’s transport network — including a new £.billion fund ring-fencing vehicle excise duty raised in England for spending on our roads.As a former Transport Secretary, I know that these are the arteries that keep our country alive – and they need taking care of. Thirty-two years ago tomorrow, Margaret Thatcher officially opened the final stretch of the M.While few would claim to love this motorway, it’s easy to forget what a landmark moment this was for our country’s transport infrastructure. Three decades later, I am committed to honouring that legacy.And as important as our major roads are, smaller local roads are just as vital to our everyday lives.That’s why I will also announce tomorrow £million of immediate cash for councils to maintain and improve local roads — fixing potholes, repairing damaged roads and keeping bridges safe and open.A further £million on top of that will help improve local junctions, allowing better access to workplaces, high streets and other community facilities.This is also part of our commitment to bridging the gap between our regions. Those in rural parts of the country should have the same chances to get on in le and not have poor transport connections limiting their potential.The funding will help make journeys quicker and easier, while boosting productivity and improving access.And because I know that not everyone drives, I will also invest in local transport projects which could include new bus, tram and cycling routes.And I will also look to the future by investing in next-generation methods of transport, which could potentially include self-driving shuttle services.Not only could this revolutionise our transport network, it will also help us become a global leader developing future technologies.And finally, as I earlier announced with the Prime Minister, I am happy to confirm we will also be freezing fuel duty, for the ninth year in a row.This will keep the cost of fuel down for millions of drivers across the UK — saving people around £million this year alone.These measures are only possible due to our careful management of the economy over the past few years — and the hard work of the British people.This country has a bright future ahead, and — thanks to this vital investment package — the journey there just got a bit smoother.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows the strength and resilience of the UK economy alongside the efforts and hard work of families and households up and down the country.In conventional times voters might rightly expect the result of this to be lower taxes , more investment in our public services or to see progress in us paying off the ever ballooning national debt.Instead the Government is preparing to blow this cash - your money - by giving into even more of the EU’s demands.Until last week, Britain expected a  month “transition” or “implementation” period after we formally leave the EU next year on March , .Then, late last week the Government shocked everyone by proposing that we stay in the EU longer than we were originally told and that we extend the so called ‘negotiating period’ to leave the EU.Worse still, on Monday in the House of Commons, we were told that this transition period might last until June  – that’s six years after the referendum result. Whatever happened to Brexit means Brexit On top of our extended membership of the EU, we can expect a bill from the EU! That’s right more of your money with an extra price tag of approximately £ billion each year in contributions to the EU.The Treasury has budgeted for this until the end of  but for each year after , the cost will be as high as £ billion because we will have lost the £. billion a year rebate which was famously secured and successfully negotiated in  by Margaret Thatcher when she demanded our money back from the EU.The British people are once again being treated like fools. What we are now witnessing is a blatant attempt to keep Britain in the EU while Brussels continues to raid the pockets of British taxpayers.This must end and the Government should invoke the great Thatcherite spirit of Fontainebleau and say No, No, No to Brussels. Because pumping our money into an undemocratic and unaccountable system two years after Britain voted to leave the EU is simply not right or acceptable. It makes a mockery of our democracy and is an insult to the British public.It is our money and that money should be handed back to the people and communities across the UK to invest in our domestic priorities.It could help people across Britain– especially the least well off – by giving them back more of the money that they earn by cutting their taxes.For example,we cut the basic rate of income tax by a penny, that would cost us £ billion.By increasing the personal allowance by a £,, many more of the poorest paid households would be taken out of tax altogether, that’d cost us £. billion. Andwe cut beer and cider duty by  pence, that would cost us £. billion.So by easing the tax burden for the lowest paid and doing our bit to save British pubs from closing, we’d have invested £ billion into longer term economic growth in our economy.And with the other £ billion  How about supporting the millions of families who want to own their own home by cutting stamp duty for homeowners, we can again help the least well off and give them a hand up and support them in their aspirations to own their home.We could also take more first time buyers out of paying stamp duty altogether  If we raised the starting threshold of £, to £,, this would cost the Treasury £. billion.Then there’s the VAT we pay on domestic gas and electricity. The  per cent VAT charge on domestic fuel and power raised around £. billion in  . If we got rid of this we would make fuel cheaper and families would have a little extra left over in their monthly pay packets.What about the VAT charged on sanitary products for women  This should end now and not when we leave the EU s the Government previously promised, especially as leaving the EU will take longer than we were previously promised. VAT receipts from the sale of sanitary products costs approximately £. billion a year but importantly this one VAT cut that would unite women across the country.I could go on. There are so many important domestic key services and priorities to invest in.To govern is to choose and the choice being made our Government is to spend your money on an expensive and everlasting EU membership.And all this comes on top of the ridiculous capitulation where we have agreed to the EU’s demands to hand over a £ billion pay cheque for absolutely nothing in .Britain needs once again to have a long term economic plan that puts our national interest first.Let’s start standing up for Britain by investing in people, businesses and communities rather than the unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats of the European Union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A seven-hour slog live from Westminster City Hall, presented by Adam Hills, Maya Jama and the network’s spare part Alan Carr, who set the tone for most of what followed interviewing Foxy from SAS: Who Dares Wins.“It’s been announced you’ve got a new Stand Up To Cancer series starting next year. Tell us about it.”“I can’t.”“Give us some names.”“I can’t.”No sooner had we written that one off than it become apparent there was no Bake Off special either — just a promo for a show that will be screened months from now. No matter, though. With its lofty public-serving hat on, Adam Hills faithfully promised Channel  would “educate, entertain and inspire” us for the remainder of the evening, which must have looked quite good written down.In practice The first thing to say about Stand Up To Cancer is that it featured some of the most beautul and affecting films you’ll see on a telethon.They needed to be, as well, ’cos you don’t have to have watched the event to know it contained a lot of feeble stunts and sketches.I also could have lived without Adam Hills carrying out a threat to have his pubic hair waxed, live, once the total reached £million, and the educational segment, with Katherine Ryan and Chris O’Dowd, which was sunk the moment he announced: “We’re goingto put the humour in tumour.”Tellingly, there was also a fair bit of non-network talent involved, including James Corden.I’ll not dwell, though, on what Channel ’s Twitter feed did to the Carpool Karaoke segment, where Michael Buble talked about his son’s illness, except to say it was one of those productions where the left hand wasn’t talking to the right.So when Chris O’Dowd was moved to tears talking about the cancer films, the studio audience was guffawing loudly at Alan Carr manoeuvring himself into background position in a Prue Leith wig.By a process of elimination and production gaffs, though, it became apparent the centre of Channel ’s entire universe now is Gogglebox, which had created an all-star version with Louis Tomlinson, Danny Dyer and daughter Dani for the occasion.They missed a trick, frankly, by not capturing Louis falling asleep to The X Factor. But it was still riotously funny watching the regulars pick apart Naked Attraction, with the choicest comment being: “That one looks like Homer Simpson’s mouth.”This was not the sound of people laughing with the channel, though. They were laughing at it.A network that was once known for being brave and innovative is now far more readily associated with a genital parade, third-rate reality shows and cakes than anything in the way of ground-breaking drama or comedy.In fact, the only two genuinely funny people on its payroll are probably Jimmy Carr and Sean Lock, who had to make way, at Stand Up To Cancer, for box-ticking randoms like Mo Gilligan, who was served this testicular curve-ball by Maya Jama.“Do you have a special name for your balls, by any chance ”He does.The Big Narstie Show.So there I was, gently drting off as Darcey Bussell went through the technical motions on Strictly. “The control in the rise and fall. Strong in the two-three.”When, unless I’m imagining it, she told Sean Walsh: “You have to smooth it out and iron it out, so it isn’t jerking off or skippy.”Suddenly I was all ears for the show’s Halloween special – an event which, for three good reasons, is usually my least favourite of the run.Firstly, Tess always expects a laugh for referring to it as a “spook-tacular”. Secondly, someone does The ****ing Timewarp. And thirdly, the worst danceris forced to jig around to The Monster Mash.We got it all, on Saturday night, of course, yet somehow it didn’t feel quite such an endurance as normal.This may have been partly down to Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer, who both danced like dreams, but it definitely owed something to the presence of Sean, who’s added real jeopardy to proceedings andactual comedy.His snog with Katya has made sense of a dreadful line-up and the BBC should be eternally grateful to The Sun and the photographer for capturing the moment.So although the handbag-clutchers will no doubt disagree, I was genuinely sad to see him voted off and probably back to the ex-girlfriend, where, in the words of Darcey Bussell, he’ll have to “smooth it out and iron it out” or he’ll end up, you know . . . “skippy”.Sandra Oh’s performance in Killing Eve.

Suzy, , was abducted in  and declared dead, presumed murdered, in .It follows information that Cannan may have buried -year-old Suzy there after abducting and murdering her. The home was first searched in  but cops have now ed to dig up a section of the garden.Excavation work was focusing on an old corrugated iron garage in the back garden of the semi- detached property in Sutton Coldfield, West Mids.A forensic tent was also placed over an area of concrete patio.Suzy disappeared after going to meet a client named “Mr Kipper” to show him two houses in Fulham, South West London in July .Her body has never been found, though she was declared dead — presumed murdered — in .It remains one of Britain’s most infamous unsolved murders.But cold case review detectives now suspect that after murdering Suzy, Cannan may have driven to what was then his mother’s home.They fear he put Suzy’s body in an inspection pit in the garage he used for working on cars, before filling it with concrete.The corrugated iron structure was yesterday dismantled by Met Police specialist search cops to enable excavation work to start.Ground-penetrating radar was used to scan the area and a tent was erected where the garage stood.The team of about a dozen officers had shovels and garden forks on hand for digging.A side entrance to the garden via a small private track, was cordoned off at around am as the search team arrived in eight police vans.Officers conducted the grim search just a few feet from a children’s trampoline and a swing.The importance of the search is enhanced by Cannan’s habit of ing to his mother’s home after committing serious crimes.It is believed that his mother Sheila is in her s and living in a dferent part of the country.There is no suggestion that she was involved in or had any knowledge of this or any of his crimes.She previously spoke about the case in , saying: He has never discussed this with me, and I have never asked him.I suppose I have had it on my mind for so long. I am getting old, and you feel guilty yourself. Hes mine, I cant deny that. He s my son who I brought up.But I still cant understand anything about why. Thats what disturbs you. Its very upsetting really.The search at her former home is expected to go on for several days. A forensic archaeologist is guiding cops during the search.It is being carried out with the full consent of a family who have lived there since Cannan’s mother moved out in .The cold case review team is not conducting a full-scale investigation into Suzy’s abduction and murder but are said to be acting on specic information relating to the potential burial site.A source said: “The couple who lived there were shocked when the police came to them asking to search their garden.“But they have given their full consent to the search.“Police have already conducted a cursory examination there and established that everything fits with what they were told.”Insurance marketer Phillip Carey said he purchased the home in Sutton Coldfield, from Sheila Cannan in .The -year-old said: From our point of view, we bought the house  years ago, from the suspected persons mother, Sheila.We knew who she was, we became aware who she was as we went through the relationship, and obviously it was high profile at the time.It is not the first time police have searched at the family home, Mr Carey said, with officers looking in a similar area about  years ago before ing on Monday.This time it is very much about ultimately eliminating the property from the process entirely - it is just a matter of an ending, for us, he added.Police have since defended the decision not to dig up the garden more than a decade ago after searching the home in .DCI Jim Dickie, who led the investigation over six years from , told the BBC: They must have had new information or intelligence. We did not dig or carry out a search of the garden because there was no evidence to suggest the body was secreted there.John Cannan was in Fulham on the day of the murder. He murdered Shirley Banks and raped and abducted other women.He was Mr Kipper - he remains the prime suspect for Suzy Lamplughs murder.Cannan, now , is serving a minimum  years in Full Sutton prison for the murder of Shirley Banks in .Information was first received in December  from one of Cannan’s fellow prisoners, that Suzy was buried under the patio at his mother’s house.The inmate came forward after police took the highly unusual step of naming Cannan as their prime suspect when the CPS ruled there was insufficient information to charge him with Suzy’s murder.Cannan is serving three le sentences for murdering newlywed Shirley in Bristol in October , attempting to kidnap a woman the previous evening and raping another woman at knepoint in Reading, Berks, a year earlier.The suspected serial killer was captured three weeks after Shirley, , vanished, when he robbed a dress shop assistant at knepoint in Leamington Spa, Warwicks.A road tax disc from Shirley’s car was found in the glove box of Cannan’s black BMW. It led to the discovery of her Mini Clubman in his garage at a block of flats where he lived in Clton, Bristol.The Mini had the  number plate SLP S — suspected of being a reference to Suzy’s name.Cannan was given a whole le sentence at Exeter crown court in April , but it was commuted on appeal to a -year minimum tarf, meaning he is eligible to apply for parole in four years.Ex-car salesman Cannan is also a leading suspect in the murder of Bournemouth insurance worker Sandra Court, , whose body was found in a water-filled ditch after she was abducted in May .Despite a wealth of circumstantial evidence in Suzy’s murder pointing towards Cannan, the case against him has been undermined by a lack of forensic evidence and a body.Three major searches for Suzy were conducted in the early s and in .The first two focused on a former barracks site in Worcestershire.Then in  a field near the barracks was searched, along with a Quantock Hills earthwork site in Somerset known as Dead Woman’s Ditch, where Shirley’s body was found in .The Met Police said last night: “The search follows information received in relation to a historical unsolved investigation.“We will not be commenting on speculation surrounding the search, or providing any further information at this time.”THE search at the former home of John Cannan’s mother comes too late for Suzy’s parents.Her solicitor father Paul died in June this year aged  after a long battle with Parkinson’s disease. Her mother Diana, , died in .Following their daughter’s disappearance, the Lamplughs, of East Sheen, South West London, set up the Suzy Lamplugh Trust to promote safety of women in memory of their daughter.They campaigned for better taxi safety and laws protecting victims of stalking.The trust today said the development was a reminder over the continuing tragedy of Suzys death.They said in a statement: The thoughts of everyone at Suzy Lamplugh Trust are with Suzys family todayToday we continue the work ofPaul and Diana to reduce violence and aggression in society, supporting workplaces to help their lone and frontline workers be safer and feel safer.Todays news reminds us once again of the continuing tragedy of Suzys story and the importance of employers taking responsibility for the personal safety of their staff.The couple, who have three other children, Richard, Tamsin and Lizzie who were both awarded the OBE in .They were convinced of Cannan’s guilt.Mr Lamplugh spoke out after the  decision by the CPS not to prosecute.He said: “Suzy was a lovely girl and we and her brother and sisters and her many friends still miss her enormously.“It’s greatly distressing that Suzy’s body has not been found nor do we know how she was killed.“The least the offender can do now is tell us where the body is.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hey! This baby was under my truck!”.The emerging woman responds: “Oh s***!

There were announcements on schools funding, defence, moving “from disposable to reusable cups across all beverage types” — even a tax break for public loos. More money for social care and Universal Credit.Shopkeepers will breathe a sigh of relief at a hefty cut to business rates.There were hints of more money for the police. Sun readers will also welcome the tax freezes on beer, spirits, cider and short-haul flights.But the big bucks — some £.billion of the £.billion extra the Government expects to spend come - — went to the NHS, fulfilling the Prime Minister’s summer promise to increase spending as a th birthday present to a health service creaking under the strain of an ageing population.The question, of course, was how the Chancellor was going to pay for it.Before the Budget, all sorts of grim possibilities had been floated.Extra taxes on white-van men, lower- ing the VAT threshold and tightening the rules about National Insurance contributions. Taxes on plastic cups . Taxes on pretty much anything, really.Perhaps the best thing the Chancellor did in his Budget, then, was say “No”.To almost all of it. For an hour or more, I waited for the sting in the tail — the bit where Fiscal Phil turned Hatchet Hammond.But it never came. In paying for his promises — and above all, the NHS — the Chancellor was helped by better-than-expected borrowing forecasts, which showed our economy’s remarkable record of creating jobs is still going strong.But he has also made a calculation that it is better to live with a small and manageable deficit than try to drag the finances back into surplus at the cost of higher taxes. And that voters will see through Labour’s promises to hike borrowing back to stratospheric levels in the name of a socialist transformation of the economy.He decided, in other words, people pay enough tax already.And he’s right. All too often in recent years, it has felt like the answer to every problem — at least from Whitehall’s point of view — is higher taxes and more interference.Hammond was never going to copy his tax-slashing Tory predecessor Nigel Lawson, who made it a point of principle to abolish a dferent tax with every Budget.But at least he drew a line in the sand, deciding it is better when hardworking people get to keep more of their own money.That ending austerity should not, and must not, mean higher tax bills. That hard work should mean hard cash in your pocket.Yes, Hammond — like every Chancellor since Gordon Brown — made too many fiddly little announcements.But he avoided the kind of whacking- great raid on taxpayers’ pockets so many were urging him towards.This doesn’t mean we are out of the woods. Britain’s growth prospects over the next half-decade are still extraordinarily sluggish.The outcome of the Brexit deal will drastically change the fiscal picture.In many ways, Hammond’s speech yesterday was a holding action ahead of the much bigger decisions to come.We still need much more radical action to kickstart growth and productivity. Despite the scale of the housing crisis, for example, there was only tinkering around the edges.But a large part of delivering that growth must involve making the economy more dynamic, more competitive and letting people keep more of their own money as a reward for their efforts — moving the country in the direction outlined by Philip Hammond, rather than the one sketched out by Jeremy Corbyn .The overall verdict on the Budget  The jokes were worse than expected but the numbers were better.More spending on the NHS, tax cuts for millions of voters and the worst ideas kept out of it.Yes, borrowing will be higher — but low enough to keep us out of the danger zone and far, far lower than under a Corbyn government.That is a menu Philip Hammond will be pretty happy with.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Pleasing Home Secretary Sajid Javid.Angry Tory MPs who had threatened numerous rebellions over funding shortfalls were happy last night.Campaigning former Army officer-turned Tory MP Johnny Mercer dubbed the defence injection “good news” as it meant an end to “the madness of the proposed in year cuts”.But right of centre economist also expressed concern that Mr Hammond was throwing caution out of the window too early.The Institute of Economic Affairs’s Director General Mark Littlewood said: “In an attempt to signal the ‘end of austerity’, it appears this government has given up on deficit elimination.But Labour called the move “patronising” after Mr Hammond said it would help buy “that extra bit of kit”.And union boss Geoff Barton said many schools didn’t have enough cash for basic education needs, let alone extras.“It will be more than a quarter of a century since the government last balanced the books”.The austerity Chancellor George Osborne’s former chief of staff Rupert Harrison added: “The government was groping its way towards a sensible strategy, but the ‘end of austerity’ language raises expectations that can’t be met”.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was delighted with the boost, as it means he no longer has to make any capability cuts over the next  months.The extra defence cash will go on cyber, anti-submarine warfare capacity, and the next generation of Dreadnought subs to carry the nation’s Trident nuclear deterrent.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The police woman told me to open my car and I told her that I needed to shut the car door to turn off the engine - I did struggle to get the car keys out when I did this.I told the officer from the very beginning that I had been drinking, but it was only one gin and tonic and a glass of Prosecco over the course of a three course meal. I struggled out of the police van, but I was wearing high heels and I don’t normally wear them.I had a terrible row with my husband about it afterwards. I was disappointed in myself and I went into a spell of depression. I couldn’t tell anybody at work about it because I am their employer and I am supposed to be an example to them.She claimed a colleague Amanda Jackson later confessed to topping up her drinks during the evening during a heart-to-heart meeting and added: She went white in the face and said ‘I’m sorry, but I topped your drinks up that night.’She didn’t know I was driving home and she told me that she had been giving me drinks. She said she topped up my Prosecco once and that she had put Vodka and Cokes on the table.If I am drinking alcohol, it’s only gin and tonic that I am drinking which I know the smell and taste of. I don’t drink vodka. I have never been a vodka and cola - it just tasted of cola.Retrospectively, I can see now that I was drunk but at no point did I feel over the limit at the time, I was talking to my colleague all the way home in the car.My cousin died after being hit by an articulated lorry and my best friends nephew was also hit by a drunk driver. I haven’t drink driven until this incident where I unknowingly got into my car while over the limit and drove.Work colleague Miss Jackson admitted unwittingly getting doubles for her boss.She said: I made sure that the drinks and food were going to the right people. I went to the bar a couple of times and ordered about four vodka and cokes each time and I just brought them to the table and put them down there.I saw she was drinking coke but I didn’t realise she was supposed to be drinking normal coke.I was just going around the table filling the glasses up. I filled them all up.When she told me what happened I said ‘Oh my god, I am so sorry I bought you some drinks and I didn’t know you weren’t drinking.’It’s all my fault and she’s in all this trouble and I didn’t know she wasn’t drinking. She is my boss and she is amazing at what she does, and I feel terrible and will take the consequences.I am not going to lie, I was quite drunk that night - about a  .”Hinds lawyer Miss Stephanie Varle said: “In the UK, a lot of people drink a small amount of alcohol and drive.You have heard that she reasonably believed that she drank a gin and tonic and a glass of Prosecco and was safe to drive home. She did go out and consume some alcohol, which the law permits her to do - but she didn’t notice her drink had been topped up.This is a woman who works  hours and was on call on that evening. I submit that when she was moving around, she would not notice an odourless drink. She was driving at a normal speed and was simply trying to circumnavigate the potholes in the road.The alcohol limit does unfortunately permit people to lawfully get behind the wheel of a car after some drink.But JP Edward Tasker, said: Having heard all the evidence, we don’t accept that the defendant didn’t know that the drinks didn’t have alcohol in them."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000445610283.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather forecast today storm adrian hurricane oscar","story":"The Met Office is warning that rainfall from Storm Adrian will lash England this morning after causing chaos with devastating floods in Italy and incredible rainfall in the Alps.East Anglia and Kent are expected to be hit the hardest by Storm Adrian, but coastal areas in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire could also be affected today.But unfortunately the wind and rain wont end there as Hurricane Oscars mph winds rage across the Atlantic towards Britain on Friday.Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: Adrains brought a lot of unsettled weather to Europe like intense thunderstorms, but from our point of view its bringing a bit of rain to Eastern parts of England.In the UK, weve got some rain affecting the Eastern and South Eastern parts of England this morning and through today.The National Hurricane Center in America is warning that Oscar will cause le-threatening swells and rip-tides in Bermuda on Wednesday.Then its effects will be felt in Britain by the end of the week - but the the violent storm is proving dangerously dficult to predict for weather experts.Alex explains: Oscars always been a tricky one and theres always been a lot of uncertainty regarding it.And at the moment, the most likely track will actually take us a little bit further North than we were thinking before.This means that torrential rain and extremely powerful winds are expected to hit the Western Isles and Highlands of Scotland, where gusts of mph or stronger are very likely on Friday and into the weekend.But because of the volatile nature of the storm, Brits are advised to look out for severe weather warnings later in the week as the track of Oscar becomes clearer.Alex added: We probably arent going to be issuing any warnings today for it, because theres quite a lot of uncertainty and the track could change again and it could come further South in which case well be changing our story because then it will affect more people.If the track that were forecasting at the moment is what happens, then warnings would be required.For today, there will be rain in the East of the UK with a few showers where and some sunny spells, with highs of around C in Devon and Cornwall.But tonight will be chilly as patches of low cloud and frost set in widely across the country as temperatures are expected to fall to -C.Last night was the coldest night of autumn so far when the mercury plunged all the way down to -.C in Sennybridge in Wales.Wednesday will also have showers in the North and West of Britain, while the South East remains dry and could reach heights of C.Thursday will see persistent rain across central and south eastern parts of England and lighter showers in Northern Ireland and Scotland.And Friday will start with a good deal of sunshine before turning very wet and windy in the North West s the effects of Oscar strike Britain."},{"url":null,"title":"giant rat invasion foot long bristol","story":"The woman, who asked not to be named, spotted the giant rodents scurrying along her turfed balcony in the Lockleaze area of Bristol.The mum said the first-floor balcony of her housing association home had become infested along with neighbours properties.She told the Bristol Post: Something needs to be done to cure this problem for good.

If a General Election is coming, what theyll do is theyll splash out some money and thenthey win the election they then start cutting it back again.Mr Hammond denied trying to bribe the electorate, saying: What we are preparing for is Britains future.Weve now turned a corner and we are able to give Britain a bit of good news.He also insisted he is still hoping to balance the Budget despite cutting taxes and increasing spending.A snap opinion poll shows that most Brits back the Chancellors decision to turn on the spending taps after eight years of austerity.Some  per cent said boosting public services should be Mr Hammonds priority, with only  per cent calling for more deficit reduction.But critics today accused the Budget of squeezing poorer workers and forcing the burden of austerity on to women.The left-wing Resolution Foundation thinktank said  per cent of the tax cuts will go to wealthier families.Director Torsten Bell said: Income tax cuts announced yesterday will overwhelmingly benefit richer households, with almost half of the long-term gains going to the top ten per cent of households.On public services, the NHS saw a big-spending boost - but unprotected departments still have further cuts pencilled in.And senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper claimed  per cent of the impact of austerity had fallen on women - adding: The gender gap in the Tories tax and benefit policies is getting worse."},{"url":null,"title":"boy crystal meth seizure halloween galion ohio","story":"Braylen Carwell, from Galion, Ohio, began shaking when he ed from collecting candy on Sunday and was rushed to hospital.While it was initially thought his sweets has been tainted with meth, the boy insists the only thing he put in his mouth before the seizure was a pair of plastic vampire teeth.Police have sent the novelty dentures, which he was given while out trick-or-treating, away to be tested.Investigators also retrieved the sweets which Braylen had been given and collected them as evidence after his parents had thrown them out.His mother Julia Pence described the moment her son began having a seizure.She told Fox : “The left side of his face was just droopy and then he fell and then he couldn’t move his left arm.“And he didn’t know where he was, he didn’t know what he was doing.”Julia says the little boy is still feeling the effects from the powerful drug.She said: “You can tell he is still coming down from it because one minute he is all hyper and the next minute he is tired.The distraught mother admitted to cops that she and the boy’s father are recovering drug addicts, reports TV.But she insists they have both been sober for sometime and strongly denied having anything to do with Braylen’s positive drugs test.She said: “Im not covering up the truth.

But as always, the devils in the detail. Once you get past the bad jokes, the shiny baubles and the claims that austerity is over - all thats left is the small print. And guess what  Some of it will leave you and your family worse off. Weve trawled through all  pages of the Budget Red Book, plus the independent Office of Budget Responsibility s assessment of the measures in it. Heres a few things you might not have spotted.  A chart buried in the small print shows how the Budget won’t actually make the poorest % any better off. This diagram shows the cumulative impact of ALL tax, welfare and public service changes since  - a mammoth task. Look at it - the poorest people are on the left, and they simply flatline in the analysis. While the richest % are taking a hit, it’s middle-class people - those in the top % or % - who will benefit the most, gaining up to pound a year.  Philip Hammond made a big play of pumping more money into defence and the NHS. But he was a little quieter about yet more swingeing cuts being forced on some of the biggest frontline Whitehall departments. The Department for Work and Pensions is being expected to cut its budget from poundbn to pound.bn in   . The Ministry of Justice is being cut from pound.bn to poundbn. And the housing and communities section of Whitehall is being cut from pound.bn to pound.bn. That’s despite a welfare crisis, a prisons crisis and a housing crisis.

Not only did he resist any call to tax plastic cups. His big signature move - a tax on packaging that doesn’t have at least % recycled plastic - will only come in April . He made no mention of the date in his speech - we had to find it in the small print. Environmental Audit Committee chair Mary Creagh blasted: This speaks volumes about the Treasury’s priorities. As China, Vietnam and Thailand close their doors on Britain’s plastic waste the chancellors response is keep calm and carry on.”  According to the OBR forecast Google and other online giants could pay a mere poundm each under Hammonds new tax. Labour said the figure was “a pittance for these massive international companies” They said the percentage of tax paid by the big five tech giants had halved since . The new tax won’t come into force until  at which time the tech giants will start to enjoy a % cut in their corporation tax rate. Tom Watson, shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said: “The lack of ambition in this announcement is derisory.” . … And it raises even less than we thought  If you thought the poundm raised from the Digital Services Tax didn’t seem like much, then don’t look at the back of the Budget book. It shows poundm a year is only what it’ll raise in . Next year it raises…. poundmillion. And in   it only raises poundmillion. . Crack cocaine of gambling stakes will stay above pound for another year  Campaigners blasted a six-month delay to cutting stakes on fixed-odds betting terminalsto pound. The move to slash maximum stakes on the “crack cocaine of gambling” from pound had been expected to come into force next April. But the Budget small print revealed the move will not take place until October. The Campaign for Fairer Gambling said it was “unacceptable”. Labour’s Carolyn Harris, who chairs Parliament’s cross-party group on FOBTs, was “appalled” at the “wholly unjustiable” delay. But a Treasury source said: “It’s clearly a judgement call. This we think strikes the right balance.”  Hammond announced an extra pound million for struggling schools to pay for “the little extras” they can’t afford. Many parents will have breathed a sigh of relief at the news, after getting begging letters from their kids’ teachers, asking for money to pay for such extravagances as pens, books and toilet paper. But they’ll be disappointed. The money is “capital spending”, ringfenced for building maintenance and purchasing equipment. That means schools will be allowed to buy iPads with the extra cash, but not pens and paper.  The Sovereign Grant - the money paid by the government to support the Queen in her royal duties is going up. Again. Last year the figure was .m - this year it’ll go up to an eye-watering pound. million. The size of the grant is usually % of the government’s income from Crown Estates. But last year she got a  year boost to % to pay for essential refurbishment of Buckingham Palace.  The government is set to introduce a tax on heated tobacco for the first time. The products will be taxed at the same rate as hand rolling tobacco from April . Note: This article originally stated the tax would also apply to vaping fluid. This is not the case. We are happy to correct the error. Duty on rolling tobacco amounts to around pound for the smallest, g packs.  Tory ministers have finally admitted they’re delaying Universal Credit, the small print reveals. The rollout of the hated six-in-one benefit will officially end in December  - the ninth delay after its last end date of March . And it may only finish in June , because the Office for Budget Responsibility “assumes” it will take six months longer than the Department for Work and Pensionssays. Just weeks ago, the DWP was refusing to confirm any delay to the Mirror. Delaying the rollout will actually save the DWP poundbillion - because thanks to a pound.bn-a-year package of help, it’s now “more expensive than the legacy system would have been”, the OBR declared. There’s also a suggestion that the money will be saved because, by delaying UC, less will be handed over to claimants in transition payments.  The Office For Budget Responsibility admits No Deal Brexit will have a “severe” impact. “If an agreement is not reached in time, it could have a severe short-term impact on demand and supply in the economy,” it says. “It is next to impossible to calibrate this sort of scenario because of the lack of precedent.” Philip Hammond announced another poundmillion in no-deal Brexit preparations, taking the total to pound.billion. The Chancellor boasted of “firepower to intervene”the economy needs more support in coming months - with poundbillion of “headroom” to deploy. Labour’s Chris Leslie, of the People’s Vote campaign, claimed: “There is no Brexit idend, only years of extended pain.” . … And the Brexit orce bill may have hit poundbillion  Again, this is one from the independent OBR, not the Budget document itself. The experts forecast that the Brexit orce bill could hit poundbn, much higher than the poundbn the government has claimed. It’s been revised up because of a weaker pound-euro exchange rate, and changes to contribution formulas and timetables. Best for Britain chief Eloise Todd said: Far from the fantasy millions promised by Brexiters, it has become increasingly clear that Britain will be facing a Brexit deficit.” . A controversial Tory home buying scheme is being reopened, and it’s costing poundbillion  You’d think a package of help for first-time buyers costing almost poundbillion might have been mentioned in the Budget speech. But nope - you have to delve into the documents to find the Help to Buy equity loan scheme is being reopened for two years from April . The scheme was previously slammed for helping buyers who were already well-off and allowing a five-year “time bomb” of fees to build up. This time it will be available only to first-time buyers - correcting a major flaw in the old scheme - but there are still some elements of unfairness. Londoners will be able to use it to get a home worth pound,, while in the North East it’s only available on homes worth pound,. And the scheme’s enormous cost on its own will attract attention.  We’ve found this one not in the Budget itself, but the report from the Office for Budget Responsibility. It says capital spending - long-term one-off hits on building projects and the like - has been cut, and the Treasury hasn’t spelt it out. The OBR says: “Departmental capital spending has also been cut from - onwards, a decision that does not appear on the Treasury’s scorecard of policy measures.” "},{"url":null,"title":"budget 2018 cigarettes price rise","story":"NewsBudget : Cigarettes price rises by p a pack - and hand rolling tobacco hit even harderThe average -pack of cigarettes has gone up by p in the Budget - while the average pack of hand-rolling tobacco is up by pShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical CorrespondentDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video whats-happening-cost-fuel-tobacco-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Budget has spelt bad news for smokers as duties on tobacco continue to go up.

The move, unveiled by Chancellor Philip Hammond yesterday, will lt the tax-free allowance to pound, - saving anyone who earns more than that pound a year. But the p tax rate threshold is also being raise to pound, - saving the richest % of Brits a further pound a year. Research today by the Resolution Foundation think tank found this years Budget giveaways will give the rich  times more than the poor.  And yesterday Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry slammed the policy as tax cuts for the rich. But askedhe would reverse the Tories tax cuts, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: We will support the tax cuts at the moment on the basis that it will inject some demand into the economy. But we put forward in the general election a fairer taxation system. So that does mean that we will be asking the top % to pay a bit more in income tax.  We will be rolling back many of the corporation tax cuts that have taken place, and we will be cracking down on tax evasion and tax avoidance. Pressed by the BBCs Today programme on why he wouldnt help the poorest by axing the tax cuts, Mr McDonnell said: What weve said is we will leave those personal allowances at whatever we inherit. But our focus will be on a fair taxation system. The most recent figures show anyone who earns more than pound, is in the richest % of Brits. The richest % earn more than pound, and the richest % earn pound,. Mr McDonnell said Labour would target the very highest earners by introducing a p Income Tax rate on earnings over pound,. And a p rate would apply to earnings above pound,. Labour mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham attacked Mr McDonnells pledge, saying: At a loss to understand why we are doing this. But the Shadow Chancellor said his key aim was to make sure the lowest paid get a decent wage. Mr McDonnell suggested the Tories were wanting to splash some money ahead of an imminent general election. But Theresa May told journalists today: We are not preparing for another general election.

The little extras headteachers need include not having to close their schools early, not having to cancel music and swimming lessons, not having to lay off teaching assistants and not having to beg parents for items such as toilet paper and stationery. Hammond’s choice of words pointed to a deeper problem. It implied that teachers and parents should be grateful for his largesse. But when you have put someone in hospital, you should not be surprisedthe patient then takes umbrageyou come round with a bunch of grapes and words of comfort. The Resolution Foundation think tank delivered its verdict on the Budget this morning and found it was deeply regressive. The Tories like to spin the raising of the income tax threshold as evidence of how they are helping the just about managing but it is a tax cut which is skewed towards the better off and does nothing for the five million people who earn too little to pay the tax.According to the Resolution Foundation, % of the income tax cuts announced yesterday will go to the top half of earners. The richest tenth of households are set to gain  times as much in cash terms next year from the income tax and benefits giveaways in the Budget as the poorest tenth of households . The small print tells a dferent narrative to that presented by the Chancellor. Once you strip away the increase in NHS spending then there is almost nothing for other departments. Even the extra pound.billion for the universal credit is offset by the poundbillion of welfare cuts being imposed by the Tories. Hammond framed his Budget as an example of how the Conservatives were balancing the ending of austerity with continued fiscal discipline. This was a sleight of hand when the figures show the strictures will remain in place for several years to come. The giveaways masked a bigger issue: the Chancellor has limited room to manoeuvre until Brexit is resolved.

The Tory claimed his fund - worth poundk per primary or poundk per secondary this year - would help buy the little extras teachers need. But it comes after years of cuts and pleas by head teachers for supplies as basic as pens and paper. Today the Chancellor told ITVs Good Morning Britain “I just thought that would be a nice gesture” so schools could buy a whiteboard, buy a couple of computers. He insisted schools could get more funds in next years spending review and it’s nothing to do with mainstream schools funding - it was simply a little extra.  But Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said people were really angered by the remark. And GMB host Susanna Reid told him: What is happening in schools where theyre considering shorter weeks. They cant buy essentials! The Chancellor snapped: Frankly I reject that. Frankly I reject that. Schools funding will be dealt with in the spending review.  We put pound.bn additional money into schools funding last year to protect per pupil spending. What I did yesterday was nothing to do with that process - i was simply giving back a little bit of the money weve saved this year so schools can buy the odd little piece of kit that they need. I think thats a nice gesture. Many of the schools I know would be very happy to have pound, or even pound, to buy a whiteboard, buy a couple of computers, whatever it is. The money, announced in yesterdays Budget speech, has been allocated as capital spending. Capital funds are ringfenced for building maintenance and purchasing equipment.  That means schools will be allowed to buy iPads with the extra cash, but not pens and paper. And its been noted the money hes set aside for schools is tens of millions less than has been allocated to fix potholes. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that while the announcement was welcome, schools needed more. Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner added: It is utterly insulting to parents and teachers for the Chancellor to talk about little extra. School budgets have been cut by billions and head-teachers are begging parents for money for basic supplies like books and stationery.

Rather than offering them for sale or exhibition, Eric kept his works out of public view - and instead stacked them around his unassuming end terraced property including his airing cupboard, in his shed and on top of his wardrobes. The massive painting collection was only discovered by relatives after the bachelor who lived alone in Warrington, Cheshire passed away last July aged  and they went to clear out his home.  Most of the pictures feature Lowry-type scenes from smoky pubs, tumbledown terraced streets and factories and showing flat capped locals with their wives. There are also several paintings of clowns, following on from Eric’s love of the circus as a child and portraits of his parents. Now Erics former home is to temporarily turned into a free art gallery for one weekend only which will display  of his paintings in an exhibition entitled  Years of Unseen Art. Younger brother Tony, , said: We did know Eric had a passion for art but never realised he had hoarded a huge collection in his home. He was a very modest man who never talked up his skills and despite doing sketches in his local he appeared to everyone just to be an ordinary Joe.  “Now all of the family have been wonderful, and we’ve all worked together in the hope that we will do justice to Erics work justice and get him the recognition he so richly deserves. We’re just sad that he isnt alive to see this all happen.” Eric the oldest of three children was born at the property in  and left school in  when he was just . He took up boxing and served four years in the Royal Horse Guards in Germany before working for local building contractors Arthur Monk in Warrington. His brother added: Eric didn’t do very well at school. He didn’t like being organised or people telling him what to do but he was intelligent and creative. He was known for having a love of boxing but he also had a passion for art too, “Despite having arthritis for most of his le, he never stopped painting. I’d call round to the house and find him painting on the front parlour. He never had any art training, but he was very committed. He was very modest. Painting wasn’t a hobby, it was his le.” Eric often drank in local pubs and working mens clubs and his paintings were often based on barroom scenes. Tony added: “Whenever he was in the pub, he would sketch on scraps of paper, drawing people in pubs across Warrington and Manchester. He especially loved Manchester in the s.  “Eric was a socialist and felt the most comfortable around ordinary working people and that they had the richest lives. He believed that people should always look out for one another. He had no formal art training beyond a sign writing apprenticeship but his knowledge and appreciation of painting was extensive – and his opinions on the subject were totally valid. He did get some offers to exhibit or buy his work but for some reason he refused as he did not want his paintings given away. Sadly his arthritis eventually prevented him from holding a paint brush but he did say he wanted his paintings to be seen after he was gone. We just assumed it would be a few pieces - but not . They were stacked up all around his house in his shed and on top of wardrobes. Im sure he will be delighted to learn his work will get a great deal of recognition.

The royal couple arrived in Australia glowing and ever since that moment the public have been keeping a keen eye on Meghans growing bump. People have showered the parents-to-be with gts for their unborn child and taken delight at hearing Harry, , open up about becoming a parent and discussing their little bump. Hes also recently revealed whether hes hoping to have a boy or a girl.  But more than this theres one thing thats really captured the attention of royal fans -the fact that no matter where she is, the Duchess simply cant stop touching and cradling her stomach. We think its totally adorable, but we cant help wondering why shes doing it  Thankfully a midwe has shared the answer. Lesley Gilchrist co-founder of My Expert Midwe explained to MailOnline that its a perfectly natural impulse no matter the size of the bump, to instinctively protect her unborn baby.  She revealed that an expectant mother may touch their bump anytime as they navigate the changes in the body and experience new sensations. Although most women will start to feel their baby move by around - weeks, some women may feel this sooner, says Lesley. Flutterings are the first sensations that are felt. However gas movement through the gut feels similar and this may cause an instinctive, involuntary touching of the stomach. It’s not uncommon for women at a similar stage to the Duchess of Sussex to feel those sensations.  She added: Those feelings of your baby moving are extremely special for women. It is such an amazing time. However not everyone is aware of this, and many people on social media have branded Meghans actions staged. One Twitter user wrote: Im not sureits a natural thing to do when pregnant or whether its a little bit staged. Another commented: Sick of the sight of Meghan Sparkle touching that non existent baby bump in every picture! #Embarrassing  A third added: All of a sudden Meghan has started locking her hands right on her tummy. Yeah, the world knows youre pregnant. Dont over-do it. But others were quick to come to her defense. I think it’s sad that people are questioning Meghan’s sincerity surrounding her bump. I once had a baby growing inside me, I can remember feeling a protection of it regardless of it only being a bean. I lost that baby. Touching my tum was the only connection I ever had to it, said someone .

The disease is caused by a person’s immune system attacking connective tissue under the skin, around organs and blood vessels. This hardens their insides, causing their tissue and organs - also including their bowels, oesophagus and kidneys - to solidy. “My disability is quite huge, Grace said. My heart, lungs, bowels, eyes, oesophagus, kidneys and hands are all badly affected because my scleroderma was not diagnosed at the early stages.  Scleroderma, affecting around , people in the UK, is treatable but not curable, with some of the most serious cases resulting in death. Grace’s late diagnosis means she cannot fully respond to any medications, stem cell treatments or organ transplants. This has left her with a “hopeless prognosis”. And my condition is so severe now because of late diagnosis. In my case everything is too late to help me, she said. The married mum-of-two is now backing a campaign by charity scleroderma and Raynauds UKcalling for faster diagnosis. Speaking about her initial diagnosis after a decade-long wait, she added: I I think my initial attitude towards my diagnosis was that of relief to think thank after about ten years or so of being told I should live with the pain, the actual cause of my symptoms was diagnosed. \u2028  “But then, with the hopeless prognosis for me, it quickly turned to that of despair.”\u2028 Other problems triggered by the condition include type  diabetes, lung disease and osteoarthritis. \u2028 On bad days, Grace struggles to get out of bed and avoids going out to socialise for fear of picking up infections. \u2028Her lung damage is also so severe she uses a stair lt to move around her home. \u2028 Speaking about her early symptoms, Grace said she first noticed something wasn’t right when she began suffering from Raynaud’s after giving birth to her youngest child at the age of .\u2028 Raynauds affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body - usually fingers and toes - and is worsened by cold weather. \u2028 With her undiagnosed scleroderma slowly attacking her organs, she says doctors initially missed the rare condition.  Instead, they advised her to manage on pain killers - or even told her to migrate to a tropical country to help with her cold hands.\u2028 Over the next few years, Grace went on to notice her skin was hardening and tightening quickly and she stopped using nail polish and hair chemicals in a desperate bid to find a reason.\u2028 Despite this, she went on to live the next decade of her le undiagnosed and in pain, before one day being rushed to The Royal Brompton hospital in Cha suffering from extreme breathlessness. \u2028 An X-Ray on Grace’s chest revealed irreversibly damaged tissue along with serious damage to nearly all of her other organs. Medics diagnosed her with scleroderma before placing her on a course of chemotherapy. \u2028 While glad to finally get an explanation to her decade-long pain, Grace felt hopeless after discovering the diagnosis came too late.\u2028  She added: “My condition is so far advanced that some revolutionary medical discoveries such as stem cell or lung transplant cant help me.\u2028 Due to the severity of my lung disease, I experience constant breathlessness and extreme fatigue and my physical disability limits my ability to socialise, partially because I am highly susceptible to infections.\u2028 “This resulted in my early retirement at , so obviously that had affected our family income. \u2028 My children had to grow up quickly because of it. \u2028 “My husband is the one that had been most adversely affected from the onset of the illness - with having to deal with house chores, taking care of our children and keeping a full time job.”\u2028 Grace manages the aggressive nature of scleroderma with eight dferent medications as well as oxygen therapy.\u2028  She is now urging anyone who may show signs of scleroderma to contact a GP as soon as possible and has backed a campaign by SRUK for better diagnosis.\u2028 Grace added: “My condition is so severe due to late diagnosis that medications cannot help me - I find this extremely frustrating. \u2028 “I think many of the complications caused by my condition could have been preventedit had been diagnosed earlier, so it’s fantastic that SRUK are running a petition for better testing and faster diagnosis.”\u2028 Scleroderma affects an estimated , people in the UK and . million people across the world, with women four times more likely to be diagnosed. Around % of people have to make  or more visits to their GP before getting a diagnosis, with % of sufferers waiting more than  years for a diagnosis, research shows. Speaking about a campaign launched to raise awareness of the condition, Sue Farrington, Chief Executive of Scleroderma  Raynaud’s UK said: “We have launched this campaign to draw attention to the need for greater understanding of scleroderma and the importance of faster diagnosis for those with the condition.

In a panic, Melissa Whitchurch, , called the Department for Work and Pensions hotline but claim she was that it was her problem. Melissa and her partner Chris Steer were expecting a Universal Credit payment of pound to be paid into their bank account at midnight last Thursday and had budgeted accordingly. However, to the mum-of-ones horror, when she went to draw out the money, her balance was just  pence. Melissa claimed the officer said the payment was not due for another six days and, when she tried to explain the mistake, told her it was her problem and hung up.  The couple resorted to scouring their home to find things they could potentially sell so they could afford to feed their three-year-old daughter, Cheyanne. Melissa, from Brighton, East Sussex, said: All that was going through my mind was how am I going to feed my daughter and send her to school without her snacks  The children all put healthy food in a box at school in the morning, such as fruit and crackers, and then they sit down and eat it together during story time. It breaks my heart to think of her feeling like the odd one out, sat there watching everybody  eat their fruit when she doesnt have any. Melissa had originally asked the DWP to change her payment schedule from a monthly arrangement to a fortnightly one.  When the family received their last payment of pound, they were told the other half would arrive two weeks later and used the money to pay bills and buy food to last a fortnight. But when the second half did not arrive, Melissa was told it would be made on the last day of the month and was forced to wait six days with only  pence to her name. She said: Me and my partner can go without, but not our little girl. If we were told this in the first place, we would have budgeted for it. Its horrible. Cheyenne is really sweet about it and she doesnt really understand, thank goodness. We try to keep her away from it. But when she sees Im upset, she will come over and cuddle me and say its okay mummy. Its horrible and the people that are supposed to help just dont care. They are heartless.  The family have been surviving on food donations from strangers and neighbours who heard about their desperate situation. Have you been affected by Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror  Melissa said: I could have gone to the food bank last week but since I thought I would be paid the next day, I didnt and the next one isnt for another week. So weve been getting by thanks to the kindness of other people. One lady heard about my situation and came and gave us some bread, milk, ham and cheese and Id never even seen or spoken to her before.  Melissa said she would love nothing more than toto work since she was signed off due to problems with her health  years ago. But the former shop assistant has limited mobility and has aids to help her around the house due to her back pain and other health issues, for which she takes more than  tablets per day.  Chris was also signed off from his job as a chef just five months ago for mental health reasons. Universal Credit is a new benefits system, introduced to simply and replace many existing benefits and tax credits and consists of a single, monthly benefit payment into a bank account. A DWP spokesperson said: “The vast majority of claimants are paid in full and on time, and are comfortable managing their money.Advance payments and budgeting support is available for anyone who needs extra help. “Universal Creditreplaces an out-of-date, complex benefits system with clf edges that disincentivised work and often trapped people in unemployment.Under UC, evidence shows people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer.The Mirror is urging our readers to back our petition to stop the rollout Universal Credit which is plunging families into debt and despair and replace it with a fair system."},{"url":null,"title":"pregnant meghan markle presented adorable","story":"NewsPregnant Meghan Markle presented with adorable gt for unborn baby - and she absolutely loves itMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have lots of lovely gts to take home with them - but the latest kind present is very, very cuteShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video meghan-tries-hand-out-welly-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have been given lots of lovely presents for their unborn baby on their Royal Tour.

As we get to mid-week, it is going to to be increasingly unsettled.  “It will be likely less cold by Wednesday but by no means warm.

Little Imans dad came home to find his young daughter lying helpless in a pool of blood on the ground. Iman, one of seven siblings, lives in the Altuhaitah district in Yemens Western Hodeidah with her family. She was in her back yard when an air strike hit her neighbours house in June, firing shrapnel towards her. Iman suffered severe injuries to her neck, hand and leg, while her three-month-old baby brother was also hurt. Her dad Salem was ing home from work as a labourer - where he earns the equivalent of just p-pound. a day - when he saw smoke billowing from their house.  Running to seehis family were still alive, he found his distressed daughter crying and screaming that she was dying. Fortunately, the youngster survived the horric ordeal. Save the Children have covered the costs of her treatment and she is due to get psychological support to help her cope with her experience. But she is just one child devastated in Yemen, amid a deadly conflict often dubbed the forgotten war. Aseel is two years old and suffers with cholera. The infectious disease causes severe diarrhea which can lead to dehydration and even deathuntreated. His young mum Salwa, who is four and a half months pregnant, also suffers with the disease. When Salwa, , first got sick, the family couldnt afford the bus fare to the hospital and her son also got infected.  Both family members have now managed to get treatment, but the mum worries about how shes going to make it to hospital to give birth safely. Ahmad, , meanwhile, was working in a fish market to help support his family when air strikes in the area left him badly injured in his leg and arm. The teenager, from Hodeidah, survived a first missile and was helping an injured man to an ambulance when a second missile struck him. He lost a lot of blood and fell into a coma, according to Save the Children. “The blood was everywhere it was a horrible scene I will never forget, he told the charity. I did not expect that the fish market would be targeted by the airstrikes. I always feel safe there but the airstrikes surprised me. When I was lying in the hospital I was thinking of my family and death. I was told that my friend who was selling water in the market was killed. A piece of shrapnel cut his head open while he was trying to escape.  My friend Hisham was only selling water in the market to help his family, just like me.” Ahmad is now recovering, but has still not been able to walk. The war in Yemen has been ongoing for three years - and has left the country in the worlds biggest humanitarian crisis. Children are the most badly affected. They face the threat of being hit by bombs, starvation and disease. Who is fighting who in the Yemen war  On one side of the war is the Houthi armed group - a rebel group linked to an Islamic sect - which was supported by some army units and armed groups loyal to late former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. On the other side is the military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and supported by President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, which has carried out air strikes in Yemen. Members of the coalition include the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan and Sudan, according to Amnesty International. The organisation says that the USA and UK have also been providing key intelligence and logistical support to the coalition.  Why and how the war began- a timeline In , the Arab spring protests undermined then president Ali Abdullah Salehs rule. The uproar led to splits in the army and allowed al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsulato seize swathes of territory in the east. In , Saleh stepped down in a political transition plan backed by Gulf states. Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi became interim president and oversaw a “national dialogue” to draft a more inclusive, federal constitution. In , AQAP survived military onslaught and drone strikes, staging attacks across the country while retaining a persistent presence. The following year saw the Houthis seize Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, with the help of Saleh.  In , Hadi tried to announce a new federal constitution opposed by the Houthis and Saleh, who arrested him. He escaped, pursued by the Houthis, triggering Saudi intervention in March along with a hastily assembled Arab military coalition. Months later, the coalition drove the Houthis and Saleh loyalists from Aden in south Yemen and Marib, northeast of Sanaa, but the front lines solidied, setting up years of stalemate. In , hunger grew as the coalition imposed a partial blockade on Yemen, accusing Iran of smuggling missiles to the Houthis through Hodeidah alongside food imports - something it has denied. Coalition air strikes that killed civilians prompted warnings from rights groups, but Western support for the military campaign continued. In , the Houthis launched missiles into Saudi Arabia. Seeing a chance to regain power for his family by withdrawing from his Houthi allies, Saleh switched sides, but was killed trying to escape them.  What has happened this year In , coalition-backed forces have advanced up the Red Sea coast against the Houthis, aiming to take the port of Hodeidah. This is the last main entry point for supplies into north Yemen. Hodeidah is a leline for goods and aid for  percent of Yemen’s population, and disruption to this port could put the lives of hundreds of thousands of children in immediate danger while pushing millions more into famine. The United Nations has warned that failure to keep food, fuel and aid flowing into Yemen, particularly through Hodeidah, could result in one of the worst hunger crises in living history. How many people have been affected  According to Amnesty International, more than , civilians have been killed and injured. But other reports suggest up to , Yemenis have been killed because of the war. Amnesty reports around three million people have been forced away from their homes because of the fighting. The organisation says . million people are in need of le-saving assistance including water, food and shelter. And a staggering .million children are out of school.  What do children hurt in the war say  Noran, whose name has been changed, is wheelchair bound after a wave from an airstrike damaged her spine. The -year-old says: “I used to go to school on foot, my le was beautul because I could walk and write. Now, I can’t walk to school. I can only go with the wheelchair. I used to be able to sit in a chair at my desk and write but now when I try to write, my hand hurts because of the injury in my back. I used to love writing, but now I can’t even hold a pen.” The latest - a surge in suspected cholera cases Suspected cholera cases have almost tripled in Yemen’s coastal Hodeidah region since fighting escalated in June. The World Health Organisation says that  per cent of all suspected cases are children under five years old. The rise in suspected cases in Hodeidah follows a dramatic increase in fighting between the Houthis and forces backed by the Saudi- and Emirati-led Coalition since June. Between  and  July, airstrikes resulted in the damage of a sanitation facility and water station that supplies Hodeidah with most of its water. Hodeidah is also home to nearly , severely malnourished children – more than a quarter of Yemen’s total. More than half a million people have been displaced from their homes in Hodeidah since June. They have been forced to live in host communities in cramped conditions, with little access to clean water and sanitation.  Shocking figures - One civilian killed every three hours in Yemen One civilian has been killed every three hours in fighting in Yemen since the beginning of August, with many more people succumbing to disease and hunger, Oxfam said last week. Muhsin Siddiquey, Oxfam’s Country Director in Yemen said: “Every single le lost to this shameful conflict, be it through armed attacks, or through starvation and disease, should be an international outrage. “Backers of all the warring parties should realise that they are complicit in this man-made crisis. Governments must comply with all international legal obligations to do their utmost to prevent civilian casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure. The international community urgently needs to do everything it can to get all sides in this war to agree a ceasefire.” On Wednesday an airstrike in Hudaydah killed at least  civilians in a vegetable market. Earlier this month  civilians including four children were killed and  others were injured when an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition hit two buses filled with passengers at a Houthi-held checkpoint to the south east of the city. A ground shelling at a camp for displaced people in southern Hudaydah killed a young woman and injured seven other people including six children. Sadly, the conflict continues.

She was then hauled off the  by two female police officers while her partner was also whipped as punishment for standing too close to each other in public. The public punishment took place in the city of Banda Aceh - where Sharia law is strictly practised and enforced.  The crime of being in close proximity to someone of the opposite sex can be punished by up to  lashes. Other offences such as gay sex, adultery, drinking alcohol and gambling can result in up to  lashes. Aceh is the only province in the country to impose Islamic criminal law and was granted increasingly special powers in  when the government struck a deal with separatists.  Indonesia is one of the most largely populated Muslm countries in the world with more than  per cent of the  million inhabitants practising the faith. Earlier this year a bride-to-be and her fiance were also publicly thrashed in the same city, after being found guilty of getting too close. Closeness is seen as a step towards pre-martial sex which is against Sharia Law and as a result the couple each received  lashes, in front of gathering crowds.  The punishments take place outside a mosque and draw huge crowds, many of whom take pictures. Meanwhile, in Malaysia, two women aged  and  were caned for having lesbian sex in a car. The women were sentenced to six lashings each and a fine of pound despite a global outcry from activists who say the sentence has no place in any civilised society.

Training has been really good and I thinkyou asked any of the boys in the changing-room we’d all be the same.“It’s really gone up a level, we’re all enjoying it and I think that shows on a Saturday.“It’s been quite tough but I think we needed that. It’s been enjoyable at the same time, though, and we’re all buying into his ideas.”Off the field there seems to be an air of optimism around Tannadice but Booth knows getting results on the pitch is the only way to realise their hopes of promotion.And that means keeping their unbeaten run under the new boss going against a Dunfermline side that have already bagged a deserved win over the Tangerines.Booth added: “Four points from the first two games isn’t too bad but I think they were two good performances as well.“We feel hard done by we didn’t get the win over Inverness – I think most people there would agree with that but it wasn’t to be.“At least we put in a really positive performance and everyone is pulling in the same direction.“There is a good feel about the place and, hopefully, we can kick on now and go on a little run.“The players, coaching staff, fans all seem to be pulling in the same direction especially since the new gaffer has come in.“A thousand fans down at Partick, great backing and then same again last weekend. The fans were right with us until the last minute.“It does help, it makes a massive dference and Dunfermline isn’t too far down the road so I’d expect another good away following.“I think the fans can see the work and effort we’re putting in, evenwe didn’t get the three points last Saturday.“The fans have been great and long may it continue.”Allan Johnston’s Pars have been struggling of late after

to win.“I think most people would be surprised they’ve not kicked on from that first game.“They played well that day and deserved the win.“I’ve not seen much of them since but it’s not worked out for them since for whatever reason.“They’ll still be a dangerous opponent, though, because they are, obviously, capable of putting in a performance but have just been a bit inconsistent recently.“If we go

But we were young and had that goal in mind.”Flicks opened on December  , the club’s name and recognisable cinema ticket logo a nod to the building’s previous le.Stuart said: “It was about creating something in Brechin that locals could enjoy.“What made Flicks so special was the support we had from the local community, other local businesses and the police.“DC Thomson played a huge part in our success. One of the reporters, James Masson, gave us major support, was always looking for a story and inwe got a lot of coverage.

That led to too many goals being lost by errors as, at high risk, the ball was played out from the back.It became increasingly clear some of his defenders in particular were not comfortable with this policy but the manager was not for budging and persevered with the style of play he was convinced would, ultimately, bring success.The number of goals it cost made it inevitable what many saw as stubbornness was what cost McCann his job.That is, perhaps, an over-simplication and, now the dust has settled on the former Scotland international’s departure, a more in-depth look throws up other factors.A look at the players he used in his eight Premiership games in charge this term highlights another couple of causes for his downfall.First off, the list of those involved looks too long. In just two-and-a-half months of league football, Dundee fielded  dferent players.Of course, injury and suspension means some of the constant stream of changes were enforced, but others suggest he was never totally sure of what his best line-up was. Given the style of play he wanted, this lack of consistency in selection had to be an issue.Arguably, an even bigger one was that he fell into the rookie manager’s trap of trying to make too many changes too quickly.The Premiership may not be one of the top leagues in Europe but it does have its own unique qualities. One of them, as most new arrivals testy, is the tempo of the play here is more frantic than in many other countries.Even players coming up from England, where the pace is higher than on the continent, usually comment on that.What that means is players from where have to be given time to adjust and, as they do, it’s important they have men around them who are already experienced campaigners in our top ision.A glance down the list of the men used this season suggests there were not enough performers who fitted into that category.Of the  he used, nine were completely new to the league, while eight others had no more than a season’s experience of it.Ironically, the most used who fell into those categories was when  started the solitary win at Hamilton last month but, in the other outings, seven or eight such players were used.That’s not saying these players are not good enough for this level but, as most experienced managers in any league will say, whatever the level of talent, having so many who are not familiar with their surroundings is a risk they wouldn’t be prepared to take.While McCann did bring in vastly-experienced Premiership performer Kenny Miller at the end of the summer transfer window, the loss through injury of Paul McGowan had to be a major blow.And it should not be seen as insignicant that, as he’s scoured the free-agent market since his arrival as manager, new boss Jim McIntyre has paid particular attention to men who know the top flight well.Martin Woods is expected to sign up once he’s proved his fitness, though Celtic on Wednesday may be too early for that. Woods’ old Ross County team-mate from when McIntyre was in charge, Paul Quinn, has also been linked."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"7-iconic-halloween-costume-ideas-related-to-glasgow","story":"If youre stressing about coming up with a brilliant Halloween costume idea, then why not look for inspiration from the wonderful city we live in."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"end-of-british-summertime-when-do-the-clocks-go-back-this-month","story":"The end of British Summertime is officially approaching, which, despite the gloom, brings one positive development ndash an extra hour in bed."},{"url":null,"title":"graeme-mcgarry-as-brendan-rodgers-prioritises-league-cup-have-celtic-given-up-on-europe-already","story":"IT was an interesting to peruse the Celtic line-upfor what was the formidable task of garnering anything from a daunting trip to Germany to take on RB Leipzig."},{"url":null,"title":"oran-mor-panic-room-play-takes-the-biscuit","story":"WHAT are the great equalisers of social class  Health, certainly.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op.

Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car.

McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground. Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance. McCall is not afraid of the big decisions and appears to be juggling his squad to perfection at the moment, as proven by this display where his team selection and tactics proved spot on.

Buzzworks managing director, Kenny Blair, revealed: “We are looking at a substantial investment in the venue and a major refurbishment. “It is now  years old and we haven’t carried out any work since the new bar five years ago. “Things are always changing in the hospitality game and you can never stand still. “Ultimately, everything has a sell-by date.” It’s understood that while the size of the venue will not change, its interior could alter dramatically.  Kenny added: “Nothing is set in stone at this stage. “In essence the only thing changing is larger toilets – there is no increase to the size of the building. “Everything  would be a redesign of the current layout. “A possible name change is among the ideas we are also considering.” The move comes as Buzzworks continues its rapid expansion across Scotland. Its newest Scotts restaurant has recently opened in South Queensferry, with another venue in Linlithgow just purchased by the company.

children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers learn lifesaving first aid","story":"CDJFA groups have been learning basic first aid skills, from paramedic Lorne McArthur, which could help treat sports injuries.The youngster#s training included cleaning and bandaging up wounds, supporting broken bones, dealing with concussion and some CPR and  children in total took advantage of this opportunity.Imogen Todd practices resuscitation watched by other young players.

Dennis Meenan when the Casting the Net project bus sailed into town.Mario and Marek enjoy fishing for mackerel from Campbeltown#s old pier with Marek even smoking their catches himself.Dennis, who stars in a video filmed for the project, popped into the bus, which was in Campbeltown last week, at the same time as the youngsters and told them tales about the ring-net fishing industry, which largely died out in the early s.Dennis, who fished all his le from the age of , explained that two fishing boats would be used to cast a net around a shoal of herring before pulling together to create #a purse# which traps the fish.He said the real skill was not in catching the fish, but in finding them in the first place, at a time when there was no sonar.Nature was the most common guide with gannets, which feed on herring, and basking sharks, which eat the same plankton as the fish, giving away their location.Dennis explained that a single gannet once helped him land a massive catch which filled four boats, off the Tiree coast.Casting the Net, a collaborative project between the Clyde Fishermen#s Association and the Scottish Fisheries Museum, is an oral history project capturing the memories and experiences of the last remaining Clyde ring-net fishermen.The bus, bought on eBay, has been transformed into the project#s mobile hub.Jill de Fresnes, from the Clyde Fishermen#s Association, talked to countless fishermen, including Dennis, carrying out video interviews and collecting clips, photographs and other artacts on display on the bus.Artist Deirdre Nelson transformed

with exquisite detail based on the interviews.The Scottish Fisheries Museum loaned several historic items to the project, including a needle used to repair nets.As he demonstrated the skill he said he would #never forget#, Dennis said: #Many a long winter#s night you#d spend standing on the quay mending nets.#The bus continued to Ayrshire and Stirling and will be at Tarbert Village Hall tomorrow,

The use of recycling boxes rather than bins and the introduction of food waste caddies has helped the county produce high-quality waste with fewer contaminants, meaning less has to be sent for treatment.Now Mr Reid wants to bring a similar approach to travel in the county as East Lothian prepares for an influx of new residents due to a plethora of new housing developments.And he revealed talks were under way to try and replace the councilrsquos refuse collection vehicles with electric versions as it looks to lead by example.He said: ldquoThe public bought into recycling because we gave them options such as the food waste bins and also because they knew it was the right thing to do.ldquoActive travel will be an evolution but we need to give people access to it.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

They also called on the Scottish government to tackle the problem with action, not words.The \"paid by the minute\" scandal centres on the care industry where councils outsource care at home to private or charitable companies. Care staff are electronically monitored ndash clocking in and out of a clientrsquos home ndash using technology such as mobile phones or iPads.As an example,a carer has five jobs in an hour each lasting six minutes then they will be paid by the minute for a total of  minutes. If the worker is on the Scottish living wage ndash pound. an hour ndash this would see them earn approximately pound. for an hourrsquos work, or just under  pence per minute. Many are not paid for the time in between jobs, or for travel to and from jobs.Scottish Care, which represents private care providers, estimates that the practice of \"paying by the minute\" occurs in half of Scotlandrsquos  council areas. An estimated  per cent ndash or  people ndash of the private care workforce, which stands at ,, are on zero-hours contracts, where most of the \"paid by the minute\" work is found. However, the numbers on ZHCs rises to - per cent in the sector of \"older peoplersquos care\".Care providers and carers are also penalisedworkers stay over the allotted time per visit, in the event of a client being ill or distressed.Scottish Care said: ldquoOver the last few years Scottish Care has continually argued for improvements to conditions which make employment in the care sector precarious for too many iniduals. One of these is the call to offer properly funded contracts to providers to enable them to reduce dependency on zero-hour contracts ... While admittedly some staff desire the flexibility that such contracts provide them with, from our research the vast majority of providers wish to move to a situation where adequate funding makes full-time contracts for the care workforce a possibility.ldquoThe main reason for the existence of zero-hours contracts is the discriminatory practice around the way in which care is bought from charitable and private providers by the public authorities. A local authority only pays for the work which is done rather than what may be intended. This makes it impossible to guarantee hours for many, especially smaller care providers.\"Scottish Care believes that we need to radically change the way we commission and buy care services ... At the moment many, especially smaller organisations, are effectively paid by the minute and therefore by extension unless the provider has its own reserves and assets the worker is paid by the minute. This is no way to deliver care in the st century.ldquoWe are faced with a scenario where workers are pressurised to get tasks done in as quick a time as possible and are penalisedthey are late for their next client. For the person receiving the care this makes the whole experience less than dignied despite the best efforts of inidual care workers ... This is especially unacceptable when we are talking about supporting people with palliative and end-of-le care.Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said: \"There is something very wrong about a local authority treating its own staff fairly and well and yet treating the staff of services they buy in, whether they are employed by a charity or private care provider, in a manner which is little less than exploitative. Workers are made to clock in and clock out and their organisations are only being paid by the minute, and even thena worker is late or stays longer because someone needs more help or is ill they are being penalised.ldquoThese electronic call monitoring systems are treating care staff asthey cannot be trusted. They do not give dignity or value to a critical workforce. If we ever want to create a fair system of work we need a fair system for commissioning care.\"We have a massive challenge to attract people to do the fundamentally important job of care. People are being put off because of unfair conditions imposed by local authorities upon care organisations. How can we expect human-rights-based care in Scotland when we have created a system which denies the basic rights to the care worker and their employer \"Jim McCourt, one of Scotlandrsquos most prominent trade unionists who runs the Inverclyde Advice and Employment Rights Centre in Greenock, brought the issue of care workers being paid by the minute to the attention of The Herald on Sunday.\"Itrsquos the ultimate in the gig economy,\" says McCourt. He blamed the issue on care providers bidding against each other for council contracts and creating ldquoa race to the bottom in the market. ldquoThey bid with prices they canrsquot meet and it is their workers who suffer,\" he said.\"These private care companies are funded by the public purse as they are contracted by councils ndash so our tax pounds are propping up this system,\" said McCourt, adding: \"This is about looking after the most vulnerable people in society. We are looking at a value set here ndashpeople think there is money to be made in this way out of caring for the sick and elderly then there is something very wrong, especiallythe public purse is being used.\"One of Scotlandrsquos most senior care officials, who wished to speak anonymously, described the practice as \"hypocritical and obscene\".\"To impose penalties because a care worker has stayed longer than was thought necessary with a client who is distressed or unwell is the very antithesis of what the care profession is about. We donrsquot treat nurses like. This is the worst type of precarious employment. The current system needs to end.A spokesperson for Cosla, the Scottish council umbrella organisation, said: ldquoCouncils work closely with the providers in their area to deliver and commission social care services. Inidual employers are responsible for their own practices but Cosla is trying to create an environment in which social care can be seen as an increasingly attractive career.\"This requires social care workers to be rewarded fairly and valued by their employers as well as by the rest of society.A spokesperson for the Care Inspectorate, which regulates care in Scotland, said: ldquoThe Care Inspectorate works closely with care providers to ensure that care in Scotland is as good as it can be. We expect everyone who relies on care at home to experience good-quality care which meets their needs and respects their rights and choices.

Will they help stimulate investment, productivity and employment  Will they favour particular sectors or income groups across the UK Second, we need to work through the implications for public spending in Scotland. Which changes will affect Scotland directly and which will work their way through the system via the block grant Third, we must consider implications for those tax powers, in particular income tax, which are largely devolved. At the least there can be effects on the base line from which adjustments for Scotland can be developed.As ever these days the new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibilitywere critical - as will be the case in Decemberrsquos Scottish Budget with the independent forecasts from the Scottish Fiscal Commission .There was little change in the GDP growth forecast ndash tiny increases for next year and the year after but from then on as we were. The key point to emphasise is that UK growth is set to remain muted, .% per annum maximum rather than the % or .% we should be seeking.But the good news from the OBR was that they expect stronger employment and sustained growth in real wages in each of the next five years. After such an extended period of decline in real wages this,achieved, will be really positive for households across Scotland.In advance of the Budget there were estimates that, thanks to strong tax revenues, the fiscal deficit for   was likely to come in some billions of pounds below prior expectations ndash giving scope for expenditure increases. The stronger than expected performance in tax revenue is now expected to continue. However, Mr Hammond appears to have flexed up and to be prepared to live with a deficit each year of around pound billion, close on % of GDP. Nevertheless the level of UK debt will fall below forecast. He claims he will meet his fiscal rules while at the same time he also claiming that lsquothe era of austerity is finally coming to an endrsquo.Most of the public expenditure changes announced do not relate to Scotland directly, but will feed through via upward adjustments in the block grant. The Chancellor tells us that the feed through will mean an uplt for Scotland of pound million in   and lsquomuch largerrsquo increases in years to come.That will be good news for Derek Mackay and team. But they must make their own judgements on how to allocate these funds ndash taking note perhaps of what is proposed in England but following their own priorities.The changes in income tax allowances announced in the Budget will cause pause for thought. The increases in personal rate allowance and the higher rate threshold have been brought forward to April .Increasing dferentials between Scottish income tax rates and those in the rest of the UK would have fiscal and ndash potentially ndash economic incentive implications.Mr Hammond did stress his desire to unleash business investment and announced measures which he hopes will stimulate activity, and which will apply in Scotland. There is an increase in the annual business investment allowance more support for UK exporters and more funds for the British Business Bank. Not massive but helpful.We must now await whatever emerges in the Scottish Budget on th December. But, as Mr Hammond himself has made clear, a lsquono deal Brexitrsquo would mean that all Budget bets are off.

He is right to be confident, because in the cold light of day this will seem like a Budget written on the air, a statement laced with promises and predictions that might come true, and might not. If they do not, Mr Hammond will escape blame. It is enough, from his point of view, to point the way to the sunlit uplands. How the country gets there is down to others. He has done his bit.He passes the parcel back to Mrs May and the music plays on, a little tinnier than before."},{"url":null,"title":"budget-hammond-turns-to-toilet-humour-as-brexit-britain-prepares-to-go-down-the-pan","story":"This means that the annual deficit ndash the prime target of fiscal policy for the past decade ndash is around half what the government thought it was. The UK government is only borrowing around poundbn this year instead of going on poundbn. It seems that the real culprit was the Office of National Statistics which has been under-estimating the size of the UK economy and the tax revenues that it generates. In many businesses, an accounting error of such magnitude might be a sacking offence.But this is government, where no one is to blame. And anyway the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is cock-a-hoop as they used to say in football commentaries, at his windfall. It has allowed him to declare the end of austerity, cut taxesby bringing forward the raising of the higher rate tax threshold, throw a couple of billion at the broken-backed Universal Credit welfare reforms , and promise poundbn for the National Health Service.It was the ultimate get out of free card for ldquoFiscal Phil as he styled himself yesterday in a Budget that was long on gagsrather shorter on reality. Austerity has not of course ended, eventhe deficit is set to rise marginally next year, for the first time in a decade. The freeze on working age benefits, like job seekers allowance, has another year to run, and local councils are still grinding through spending constraints that has led some of them to go bust, in England at least.But relief is at hand. The Chancellor made a groan-worthy bid for tabloid headlines by announcing business rates relief on public conveniences. Britain may be about to go down the toilet after Brexit, but at least well be able to spend a penny without that adding to the cuts in social care.ldquoIts the only thing that hasnt leaked, he quipped, in what sounded like a dig at the Prime Minister. Theresa May had pre-announced many of the headline items in the Chancellors Budget, like the freeze on fuel duty and the extra for the NHS. Which, as a number of analysts pointed out, isnt all that earth-shattering at .% per annum. The increases in NHS spending under Labour were far greater than that.But of course, according to the Chancellor, austerity was all the fault of Gordon Brown throwing our money down the pan in his Venezuelan years. You might have thought that the  financial crisis was caused by excessive bank-lending, sub-prime mortgages and the behaviour of the likes of Fred Goodwin of RBS. But no, it was ldquoLabours Great Recession, according to Mr Hammond yesterday.Jeremy Corbyn was furious about that in his Budget response in the Commons, which as usual failed to soar to oratorical heights eventhe indignation meter was off the scale. The Leader of the Opposition was also furious about the Chancellors claim that ldquoincome inequality is less today than under any of the last Labour governments.This is actually true ndash in a way. The bottom % of earners have indeed seen their earnings increase faster than the top %. But this is largely because median wages have been frozen for the last decade, while there have been signicant increases in the Living Wage ndash up to pound. after yesterdays hike. So, it is more statistical than real, and is actually a measure of how poorly the economy has performed for middle Britain ndash the very ldquohard-working families the Chancellor appealed to yesterday.Indeed, you could almost say that the relative increase in the earnings of the bottom % has largely been paid for by the longest pay pause in  years. It doesnt alter the fact that the top  richest families in the UK have doubled their wealth since the crash, or that CEOs now earn  times the average pay of their employees. The inconvenient truth is that people on higher incomes have done extremely well since the crash and will continue to benefit disproportionately from the Chancellors windfall.It will also help Mr Hammonds Scottish equivalent, Derek Mackay, out of his own budgetary hole. That poundbn for the NHS should push around poundbn north through the magic of Barnett Consequentials. It couldnt come at a better time. Following Audit Scotlands report last week saying that the Scottish NHS was ldquounsustainable, Nicola Sturgeons hard-won reputation for sound management of the health service was beginning to look distinctly shoogly. Wisely, Mr Mackay has promised to put every penny of the UK NHS uplt into health, where it belongs. Its not entirely clear that the Scottish government has always done this in the past, evenit has kept health spending ahead of inflation.The Chancellor said that Scotland stood to gain nearly poundbn in extra cash next year alone, when other factors were included. The slashing of business rates by one third for small companies will also have lucrative consequentials, though Mr Mackay isnt quite so certain that this will all be handed on. To be fair, the Scottish government has led the way in helping small businesses weather the storm on the high streets. Its long-running small business bonus kept many village shops from going under, and it seems that the UK government has noticed.There will be no changes to tax reliefs on North Sea Oil industry which will also come as a relief to the Scottish Finance Secretary. And there is no increase in whisky duty, to allow us to have ldquoa wee dram for Ruth Davidson as he Chancellor put it. What he didnt say is that we may need a drop of the hard stuff to deal with Brexit.This was the oddest Budget I think Ive witnessed. This is partly because of the unreality of the underlying fiscal figures: I mean,the OBR can get its numbers so massively wrong this year, isnt it possible that, in future, it may make a similar mistake the other way But it is also the last Budget before everything changes on th March next year as Britain crashes out of the European Union. The Chancellor hardly mentioned Brexit in his speech, except to offer the alliterative forecast of a ldquodouble deal idend. He gave no indication of how this might materialise, or how it squared with his own Treasurys forecasts of the negative impact on the UK economy of leaving the single market.Philip Hammond has made clear that his Budget only worksthere is a favourable Chequers deal, guaranteeing friction-free trade with the EU. That looks distinctly unlikely. On the very day of the Budget speech, the former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, penned another epistle in the Dailycalling on his Tory colleagues to ldquochuck Chequers which he believes will leave Britain at the mercy of malign Brussels bureaucrats, determined to bring Britain down.We may look back on this Budget as the last of its kind before Britain enters a new era of extreme economic turbulence and self-inflicted uncertainty.

Itrsquos possible he kept this collection as a research tool.ldquoThese are images we really should treasure.Dr Marshall was born in Leith in , and became minister of Kirkgate Church in .

While some within the organisation obviously believe that such a big gesture is necessary for RBSrsquos ongoing rehabilitation, other steps the bank is taking are likely to help it get there in less grandiose fashion.Indeed, you only have to take a look at the notes the bank has issued in the years since its near-collapse, all of which feature the image of a woman, to get an idea of the kind of organisation RBS would like to become. After putting writer Nan Shepherd on its pound polymer note in , the bank used an image of astronomer and mathematician Mary Somerville for the pound version it released a year later and has now followed that up by putting entrepreneur Kate Cranston of Willow Tearooms fame on its new-issue pound note.After nearly  years in which only men - and well-connected men at that - were thought worthy of such an honour, you may think it is about time that women were given their turn. Coming as it does from an institution that just  years ago epitomised all that was wrong with the testosterone-fuelled macho world of business, though, this is about so much more than simply giving women a shot. It is about showing that RBS has changed into an entity that is not only self-aware but, crucially, is aware of the world it inhabits too.For too long the notes printed and distributed by banks have given the impression that that world is one where only men matter, or at least where only menrsquos achievements are worth taking note of. As journalist and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez said when challenging the Bank of Englandrsquos  decision to replace prison reformer Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on its pound notes: ldquoAn all-male line-up on our banknotes sends out the damaging message that no woman has done anything important enough to appear.Our towns and cities are full of images and symbols of what countless men have achieved, with the naming of streets and chiselling of statues conferring Men of History status on them in the process. Women have not been afforded this luxury and, with some exceptions that remain woefully few and far between, their many achievements have gone unnoticed. This was highlighted by Willow Tea Room Trust chair Celia Sinclair when she said at the launch of the new RBS pound note that while Kate Cranston was an ldquoexcellent businesswoman who changed attitudes, in her day she really wasnrsquot all that unusual. ldquoThere were many women like Kate Cranston around at that time, but history simply doesnrsquot remember them, Ms Sinclair noted.That society has been able to forget those and countless other women is damaging because while it risks giving women the impression that they have nothing to live up to, it also perpetuates the myth still believed by some men that they simply havenrsquot achieved anything worth commemorating in the first place. All little girls need positive role models to give them the belief that they can grow up to be whatever they want to be, but it is just as important for equality that little boys know that women fulfil important roles too. I hadnrsquot realised quite how important until the day my then three-year-old son, who up until that point had only ever been seen by a female GP, couldnrsquot get his head round the fact the doctor we were off to see was going to be a man. Seeing is believing, though, and after that visit he took me at my word when I said that, just like women, men too can be anything they want to be.Which is why it is so important that Nan Shepherd, Mary Somerville and Kate Cranston, whose histories show what women can achieve in the arts, science and business worlds, have not just been commemorated but have been commemorated in a way that ensures all of us will come into contact with their images again and again and again. As RBSrsquos Scottish chair Malcolm Buchanan said when he unveiled the Kate Cranston pound last week, the bank feels that ldquoa banknotersquos value is more than just the figure printed across its front - it is our symbol, which lives in peoplersquos pockets and touches everyday lives.A statue in a part of a town that a fraction of us will visit or a portrait on a wall that only some of us will pass by is one thing, but an image on a note that will fall out of birthday cards and get passed from person to person as we go about our daily lives has the potential to have a far greater impact on our collective consciousness.RBSrsquos inclusion of women on its notes may have come at a time when banks in general are making plans for a cashless society, but there are still tens of millions of them in circulation and it is no exaggeration to say that in an incremental way the move will help to make society better for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"apa scoops 50k mackie s donation","story":"North east ice cream firm Mackie#s of Scotland have given a bumper #, donation to Aberdeen Peforming Arts.The Westertown-based firm have agreed to donate £, and will add a further £, per year over the next three years to the charitable organisation behind the operation and the refurbishment of the Aberdeen Music Hall.The vital funding will go towards the venue’s creative learning hub – and it will help broaden access to the arts, support youth arts and develop aspiring and established musicians in Aberdeen for years to come.Jane Spiers, chief executive of Aberdeen Performing Arts said: “The Music Hall transformation is ensuring that it will continue to be at the heart of the city’s cultural scene for many years to come“Mackie’s very generous donation is a further extension of our strong relationship.“We have a great working relationship that included supporting last years’ Granite Noir and True North festivals, and this additional investment in the Music Hall is a further fantastic endorsement of our work in communities and with children and young people.“Plans are already well underway for the re-opening of the Music Hall after an ambitious, multi million pound transformation that includes vastly improved street to seat access, a new creative learning studio, performance studio, café bar, reception, upgraded auditorium and back of house facilities and historic fabric repairs.”The -year-old Music Hall building is reopening later this year after an intensive multi-million pound makeover to ensure it can continue to deliver a busy programme of works for generations to come, in the finest surroundings.Karin Hayhow, Marketing Director and one of the firm’s three sibling owners, said: “We’re all looking forward to a visit to The Music Hall when it reopens after such an ambitious renovation project.“The new performance and educational opportunities this will bring is exciting for Aberdeen.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Tuesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmA special fund to help retell the remarkable tale of the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow almost  years ago has been launched by Orkney Islands Council .

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority. We will continue to work closely with Scottish Government, other agencies and industry at this time.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue. Let me be frank, these changes would not have been possible without the intervention of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson MSP.\"The local communities deserve a huge amount of credit as well. Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Tuesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Grown in sunlight, without hydroponic lights, and sprayed with a fine mist of salt water from the sea nearby. They taste and smell like the tomatoes we grew up with,” she says. A tomato whose taste is down to the concentration of minerals in soil enriched by millennia of stratication of lava, and as she talks, she’s taking me on a journey where taste is all about time. In a world of rolling news and   Twitter feeds, with , people following her Instagram posts, a new restaurant opened this year and another opening next month, “call it five” books to her name and another out this month, chef and food writer Gizzi Erskine wants us all to slow right down. That’s why her new cookery book is called Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over, designed to teach the art of slow cooking and how to serve up stews, soups and hearty sauces. She’s fed up with quick cheats and cutting corners and wants us to prod the produce, take time trying out techniques and linger lovingly over the creation of a kale, spinach and ricotta conchiglioni. It’s time to stew, braise, bake, poach and roast.“We are so short of time in our lives that we forget that cookery does take time,” she says. Not that one of the first proponents of the pop-up restaurant doesn’t have time for fast food: “Sometimes you’ve just got to have something on your plate instantly, so you batch cook at weekends and have quick ready meals for the week. But I think losing yourself in the cookery process is therapy as well.”Taking time out to enjoy the process is close to Erskine’s heart after a busy year that started with her opening her first solo restaurant, The Dining Room, at Mare Street Market in a former office block in Hackney, and will end with the opening of vegetarian burger chain, Filth, a joint business venture with model-turned-nutritionist Rosemary Ferguson aimed at delivering healthy food to hedonists. The pair met at a festival, music being a passion of Erskine’s from hosting a cookery and cabaret stage at Latitude to what she calls a “penchant” for musicians, including Klaxons rocker Jamie Reynolds who she dated and split up with in . All this and her latest book, out this month, Gizzi doesn’t appear to be someone to whom you’d attach the adjective “slow”. After leaving school at  and home at , Gizzi – short for Griselda – was in a hurry to get on with le and success came early. While working as a body piercer in Camden, she trained at Leith’s School of Food and Wine in , graduated top of her year and won an internship at BBC Good Food magazine, writing and styling while working in kitchens and starting her own catering company. With her psychobilly flicky eyeliner and beehive hairstyle she was made for TV, and Channel  gave her her own show, Cook Yourself Thin, followed by Cookery School and Drop Down Menu. More TV followed with Sky Living. At the same time, she was turning out cookery books including Gizzi’s Kitchen Magic and Skinny Weeks  Weekend Feasts as well as writing for magazines and newspapers including InStyle and Sunday Times Style. And then there were the pop-ups, from a gourmet pie shop to food inspired by the New York Korean hole-in-the-wall scene, and one in Edinburgh during the Festival.But it’s time to slow down and talk about Slow. At , Erskine is at pains to point out she has been doing this for a long time. “I just wanted to be respected for the job I do it’s not just about how I look. I work very, very hard, I’m probably one of the hardest-working people in the industry. I’m good at my job and want people to recognise it. And I think that’s why people like Mark Hix, Angela Hartnett and Tom Kerridge, all the big guns, have always taken massive care of me, and that’s because they trust me as a cook. I dunno, it’s probably all my own shit to be honest, in my own head, but I just feel like I’ve been doing this for a long time now.”Erskine’s big purpose is to get us to slow down, embrace ingredients and technique – and for her own part, she also wants to be taken more seriously. Always a huge fan of methodology, she found the quick and easy recipes approach demanded by media for cookery frustrating. “I’m like, ‘You know what, I’m a chef, a real chef, and I really enjoy the process of cookery and I love technique – it’s what I get my kicks from’. “I’m really pleased with this book,” she says. “You know when you talk about rock stars making a brilliant album with a load of banging hits, that’s what these recipes are like. Often you lose something in a book, but they’ve kept my voice.“And one of the great things is it’s the first one I’m not on the cover. I’ve begged not to be on the cover of every single one – I think it’s a celebrity chef thing – but I don’t buy those books, I buy ones written by proper cookery writers or real old school chefs. “I want this book to stand for something. I don’t want it to be just like I’m spoiled and I’ve been on the telly and can write lovely recipes. I actually have a big purpose and I want to get out there and make changes,” she says. Not that Erskine doesn’t care about the visuals – like the shiny bob that replaced the beehive a couple of years ago – but she’s moved on from Cook Yourself Thin and Skinny Weeks  Weekend Feasts, having a more complex take on body issues these days. Of a recent post online where she mentioned putting on weight, she says: “I did that without thinking, but , people responded, so it touched a lot of people. But I don’t want it to be a thing that defines me. I put on that weight because I worked my arse off this year, setting up businesses, writing a book and helping build a house. It’s been an exhilarating, tiring  months and I lost my way in my diet. Is that the biggest thing you’ve ever been through  Absolutely not. Do I stand for more than this  Yeah! You know what, I don’t want to talk about it any more because I don’t think it’s very feminist. “Obviously my image and having a certain style has been a part in what I do and that’s been brilliant I probably wouldn’t be doing what I do without it. I’ve done a lot of TV – the last one was a Korean show for BBC One, My Seoul Food, where I got to live in Korea for four months, maybe one of my best experiences of all time. And I got to work with Idris Elba and Paloma Faith and Rankin on Sky  HD, and I pinch myself every day about that sort of thing. But the stuff I like best is educating people, showing them new things. “I’ve been doing this for more than  years, and won awards before I did TV, I’ve written a column for the Sunday Times for almost three years. I’ve earned my stripes. I’m a perfectionist and meticulous and I really want to be known for being good. That’s the first and foremost thing.”The wake-up call that her style was being valued over her stew came for Erskine when her annual appearance in the Evening Standard newspaper’s , Most Influential List saw her listed under “Party Girl” rather than “Food”. “I was like, f***, that is the worst thing! It’s my choice to do social media, because I love my fans and the fact I can have conversations with them, but when your lestyle choices make people see you dferently that’s no good. It was my fault and I deserved it. I thought I want to be recognised for doing my job, and I am good at my job, and it was important I stuck with it and showed how much I respect my industry. “Now I’m back in the Food section,” she says, satisfied, “have been for the past three or so years.” During her childhood, the family travelled a lot because of her mother’s﻿ work – Erskine and her two sisters spent time in Thailand, Switzerland and Spain after her parents’ orce. As Erskine puts it now, with a laugh: “I’ve had a very weird upbringing, there’s lots of weird shit gone on.” Food was always part of her le, with her mother teaching her recipes – her influence is in the new book. There’s also the Scottish grandmother from Edinburgh, Mona, a brilliant cook who married a Polish Jew who escaped the Nazis, and flitted between Communism, clairvoyance and Buddhism. She died when Erskine was a child, but came through to Erskine years later when she visited a spiritualist. “They said ‘Mona’s here’. I was still piercing at this stage and she said either you or your mother need to cook, because you both want to, so I went home and asked my mother what it was all about. She said, ‘That’s your grandma’, and it was on the nose. Mona has come through again, this time in the book with a Jewish chicken soup recipe.” Erskine’s father was also Scottish, from Dumfries, and she lived there briefly when she was very young. She still calls Scotland “the motherland”, priding herself on her mince recipe.It was the death of Erskine’s father on the day of her first GCSE exam that saw her leave school immediately at . “School wasn’t for me anyway,” she says, “and it turned out later that I had ADHD, which made sense. In  Erskine was officially diagnosed with the disorder and she’s very upfront about how cooking helps and is helped by it.“I can be hyper-focused and hyperactive at the same time, probably everyone ’s nightmare. So I’m either distracted and it’s knock me on the head to get attention, or bouncing off the walls and I find it very hard to listen. So cooking is like exercise, it’s therapy for me. “There’s also a side where I felt too clever for school, which is really knobby, and no-one really explained the importance of education. I was a bit of a dick in that I chose to leave but I was a nightmare at , going out, having a wild time, and my father died, so it was a bit of an excuse for me not to go back. “I was devastated by his death, but I didn’t face it. It took me five to ten years to really accept it. I put my head in the clouds and wanted to party. But now as a grown up, I don’t necessarily believe leaving school was the worst decision. “What would I have doneI’d stayed  Gone to art school maybe, but I don’t think I would have learnt as much as I did going out to work. I started piercing when I was  and I loved it and it set me up with the particular skills that I learnt from and transferred to cookery. That sounds like a ridiculous synergy, but I learnt things like wanting to be the best and investing in something, going on courses to improve. It was a brilliant lesson in how to be good at something,” she says.Erskine still loves piercing but has reduced her own ironmongery from  or  to just the one. As to its whereabouts – “I’m not going to tell you that.” She laughs. After seven years of piercing Erskine decided to pursue her love of cooking and enrolled at Prue Leith’s prestigious London cookery school, still piercing and working in restaurants to fund her studies. “My family is quite bohemian and we were very broke,” she says. “I lived on my own and ended up squatting, doing school in the day then in kitchens every night, and piercing and restaurants at the weekend, and yeah, probably partying too hard. So I lost it, I was just so exhausted.” Physically and emotionally something had to give and Erskine thought about quitting, but the school wanted her to stay and loaned her the fees for the last term. “They were so kind and saw something in me, so I was like f***, I’ve gotta do this!” Success followed, but nothing has given Erskine more satisfaction than her first solo restaurant at Mare Street Market, where she was hands-on in the kitchen until preparations for veggie burger eatery Filth took her away recently.“Cooking really good food people are coming back for… It was something I took a long time to get my head around, whether I wanted to be involved in business or not, but it’s been really satisfying and confidence-boosting,” she says. With Mare Street Market under her belt, she’s putting the finishing touches to the sustainable burger enterprise and is evangelical about the vegan burger she’s concocted with sidekick Ferguson. “We’ve spent a lot of time messing around over a cauldron,” she says. “We’ve made this patty that’s a real game-changer. Totally vegan, it feels similar to a traditional beef burger but has more protein, fibre, nutrition, and all the umami. I sound a bit Miss World,” she laughs, “but I’d love to make an impact with it, because what we eat is crucial and it’s time for a revolution in food.” So with a busy year behind her, Erskine might be forgiven for retreating to the warehouse she’s converting in Hackney with her ex-boyfriend, curling up with her cats Kimchiand Ponzuand taking time out to slow cook a ragu. “No! I’ve got another interview to do, five minutes ago!” she says, before briefly explaining her domestic set-up. “We were together for ten years and then broke up for five and now we’re building a house together. We’re best friends now, and it’s a lovely little set-up. We love each other, it’s great,” she says.With  just around the corner Erskine is happy with her le as it is. “I feel ageless. I don’t feel the need to settle down and have kids. I’m really satisfied and have a very fulfilled le and get kicks from so many things. I don’t have time for anything . “I’d like to do more cookery books but I want them to be for the right reasons. I don’t care about just churning them out. I want to spend time thinking about the next step, spend time making it good.” Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over by Gizzi Erskine is out now, published by Harper Collins at £©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4821525.1540844399!/image/image.jpg","title":"jamie cooke scotland is on the brink of a new scottish enlightenment","story":"Scotland can create a new philosophical revolution to rival the achievements of David Hume, Adam Smith and others during the Scottish Enlightenment of the th century, writes Jamie Cooke.During the heady days of , when the country was immersed in the debate around Scotland’s constitutional future, a recurring question that arose was whether we were at the beginning of a new Scottish Enlightenment.Regardless of where you stood on the question of independence, the unparalleled levels of public engagement and debate seemed to indicate an appetite for a new conversation about how we wanted society toand the principles that we wanted to underpin it, many of which were shared across the constitutional ide. The challenges we face around the changing nature of work, globalisation, inequality and automation create a space for new ideas to grow and to be tested, to open up new opportunities.It’s fair to say that in the years since the referendum the challenges have continued to grow, and indeed have been added to as we head towards the uncertainty of Brexit and its long-term impacts on the country. We’ve seen some change in approach and thinking in response to this – the Scottish Government’s leadership around the concept of basic income being one of the most innovative examples – but it also seems that the new Enlightenment has not quite happened. The desire is there, but the actuality of bringing it to fruition seems to still be waiting to reach a tipping point.: Jamie Cooke: A basic income for all is not deadAt RSA Scotland – the Scottish arm of the global Royal Society for the encouragement of the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce – we believe that this tipping point is now. We are an organisation founded during the Enlightenment on the very principles of humanism, autonomy and universalism which have such a critical role to play in the challenging world we are in. Work is changing dramatically, and economic insecurity has become one of the defining features of the modern economy. Punitive approaches to social security such as Universal Credit have created hugely negative impacts for citizens, and fail even on their own narrow objectives. International collaboration feels weaker than it has done for many years, as ious governments follow protectionist programmes at the expense of mutual benefit. And the looming catastrophe of climate change is already forcing communities to have to move away from lands disappearing under the waves, or to suffer extreme weather conditions which lead to loss of le and economic collapse.This paints a pessimistic portrait of the world, but we strongly believe that turbulent times can also be the spur for new innovation and progress. Much as the original Enlightenment was a powerful response to the dark times which preceded it, our challenges today require us to create new thinking. A new Scottish Enlightenment would build on those original principles, particularly in its openness to the rest of the world, and would harness the power of technology and communication for the common good. It would utilise new deliberative forms of democratic engagement which can revitalise our politics. It would see us renew our social contract to one of opportunity and security, rooted in policies such as basic income which are humanistic, universal and trust the autonomous decisions of our citizens. It would turn the development of automation and articial intelligence from threats to opportunities, to reconnect us with good work and an appreciation of the iety of ways that people make a dference to society, such as caring and volunteering.: Five Scottish philosophers who helped shape the worldWe were therefore delighted earlier this month to have the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon deliver her keynote speech on Brexit at our historical headquarters in London. What was crucial for us was that the First Minister started her speech by celebrating the Enlightenment principles which are shared by the RSA and the Scottish Government, and called for them to be a renewed focus for policy making. This is not a party political statement – for us at RSA Scotland it is a responsibility for all parties, civic society, academia, business and the wider Scottish public, to rise to the challenges which confront us. It shows that there is an appetite in Scotland for truly embedding Enlightenment thinking into our decision making processes, to broaden out our civic engagement. It’s a big call, but one which could fundamentally change our country.So how do we move from talk to action  It will, at heart, be a collaborative effort – no one group or organisation can claim the principles of the Enlightenment for themselves. At RSA Scotland, with our erse and inspirational Fellowship in Scotland – part of nearly , Fellows across the globe – we are opening up the opportunity to make this a reality for the rest of Scottish society. We want to work with you to help take this forward, to update the thinking for the st century, and to identy how we can tangibly change society by turning ideas into action. We want to convene a gathering on the new Scottish Enlightenment which will be seen as a powerful, society-wide response to the dark times we are in, and a positive statement of the future we want to create. In the Great Room of theRSA House, where the First Minister gave her speech, the walls are covered with the famous series of paintings, Progress of Human Knowledge and Culture by James Barry. Showing the journey of humanity from darkness – and the risk of ing there once again – it offers us an inspiring call to action for the st century. As once before Scotland played a critical role which outweighed our size and location in the world, we believe that once again we can do so, and that out of these challenging times a new Enlightenment can be our response.Jamie Cooke is the head of RSA Scotland.

The wolves achieved this through predating grazing animals, which in turn took pressure off young trees and helped kickstart the recovery of a lost forest. The forest then grew up along rivers that in some cases changed course.But keystone species don’t always have to be apex predators, they can also be ones which physically create habitats in which hundreds of other animals and plants can play out their lives. The humble seaweeds known commonly as kelp are such species. Their keystone role is so important that, last week, Sir David Attenborough spoke out on the need to protect kelp from the industrial-scale harvesting proposed in Scotland’s inshore waters. Sir David was unequivocal in his statement that the dredging proposals are a “wholly short-sighted measure that risks the wholesale devastation of our kelp beds”.: Mechanical dredging for kelp would be environmental vandalism, MSPs toldKelp forms underwater ‘forests’ that provide food and shelter for myriad marine le including sea squirts, anemones, molluscs, worms, brittlestars, prawns, soft corals, sponges, amphipods and fish such as lumpsuckers, saithe, pollock and wrasse. They also provide us with an array of benefits by sequestering and storing carbon, providing breeding grounds for commercially important fish and protecting coasts from storm damage. Remove kelp and we remove an entire living ecosystem – hence Sir David’s unusually forthright appeal.The kelp harvesting proposal has been made by the Ayr-based company Marine Biopolymers, who wish to dredge , tonnes of kelp a year along Scotland’s west coast. Harvested kelp is valuable for processing into a carbohydrate called aginate, used in iety of dferent products from salad dressings and ice cream to shampoo, toothpaste, and pharmaceuticals.Consultations on the proposal are ongoing but Green MSP Mark Ruskell successfully amended the Scottish Crown Estate Bill during the second stage of its current passage through parliament with a clause that effectively bans harvesting techniques that prevent plants from re-growing. If this amendment survives stage three of the Bill, it may well render the Marine Biopolymers proposal redundant. Many would celebrate such an outcome, not least those who have businesses that depend on healthy coastal ecosystems, including those who gather kelp using sustainable, hand-harvesting techniques.: Jonny Hughes: We should encourage conservation beyond deer and grouseThe kelp drama illustrates perfectly the new contract we need to negotiate with our natural environmentwe are to have a sustainable, prosperous future. On the one hand, we have a proposal which could plunder a valuable resource, leaving it so damaged that its future value will be lost. This is exactly what happened with Scotland’s herring fishery, which from a peak of  million barrels in  collapsed to nothing by the s. Alternatively we can look after the vital stocks of natural capital within our kelp forests and seek instead to realise the idends these stocks will providemanaged responsibly. Some of that value might be direct financial flows, for example from products manufactured from hand harvesting. Some of that value will be less obvious but even more vital, such as natural coastal defences, carbon storage and protection of breeding grounds from which we derive world-beating, nutritious seafood.The kelp debate is a chance to show we can sht from a model of plunder to a model of stewardship in our marine environment. Let’s make that move.Jonny Hughes is Chief Executive of the Scottish Wildle Trust.

Not because we wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder with Nigel Farage # a man we had, and have, nothing in common, politically, industrially, or ideologically, writes Mick Whelan, the union#s general secretary.Instead, it was because we believe the EU has become a rich man’s club which offers plenty for the boss class – but very little for the ordinary hard-working men and women trying to earn a living in this conservative age of austerity.I’ll be frank. We didn’t realise that the Tory government was going to make such a horse’s arse of leaving. I was a district organiser for Aslef before I became general secretary, and I know that our isional organisers and company council reps are much, much better negotiators than the risible lightweights Theresa May has sent to try and do the business in Brussels. And, while I know she was a remain supporter during the referendum campaign, she did famously say “Brexit means Brexit, and we will make a success of it”.Now there were cynics who suggested that “Brexit means Brexit” was one of the more fabulously fatuous remarks of our times. But many of us took it to mean that there was no going back, and that May would be able to do a deal that was good for Britain. That, after all, was the promise she made.But it doesn’t look, right now, asshe will be able to do a deal at all. And any deal which she does put before Parliament looks asit will fall far short of what Boris Johnson, Liam Fox, David Davis and the other Brexiteers promised during the referendum campaign just two years ago.: No-deal Brexit an ‘absolute nightmare’ for economyAt the heart of our objections to the EU were a couple of proposals which we knew would be bad for Britain, in general, and bad for the railways, in particular – the European Commission’s Fourth Railway Package and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnershipwith the United States.The Fourth Railway Package is a controversial set of proposals which would foist the British model of rail privatisation on the rest of Europe. We know privatisation does not work. It’s not the right model for Britain and it’s not the right model for Europe. But this package, which despite the reservations of many MEPs, and protests from rail workers across the continent, is the one the neo-liberal ideologues at the heart of the EU are determined to foist on people whether they want it or not. It will turn what we see as a public service into an opportunity for a few firms to plunder a private profit.Because privatisation has not worked, does not work, and will not work in what is a natural monopoly. The model is broken and is selling Britain – passengers, taxpayers, and those of who work on the railway – woefully short. In the last -odd years, since John Major privatised our industry in the s, we have seen our rolling stock get older, our trains get more crowded, and our fares go right through the roof. We now have the highest passenger fares in western Europe. Why  Because of privatisation!: Brian Wilson: May must ditch DUP and its ‘blood red line’ over BrexitTTIP was a free trade and investment treaty being negotiated, in secret, between the EU and the US. It was, and is, unnecessary, as the EU and US already enjoy strong trade and investment relationships, with tarfs at minimal levels. So why are some companies so keen to see this new deal signed  Because the aim was to remove barriers which restrict the profits transnational corporations can make.The problem, of course, is that what global corporations perceive as barriers include vital regulations protecting our labour rights, food safety and banking safeguards. It might be handy for a profit-hungry corporationit didn’t have to comply with pesky social and environmental regulations but it would not be very good for the rest of us. TTIP appeared to wither away – first there were problems in the European Parliament and then Donald Trump seemed to prefer to pursue his aggressive America First policy – but there are signs that this zombie deal has been resurrected behind the scenes.Britain’s public health and education sectors have suffered gradual privatisation and TTIP will only accelerate this transformation of our public services into privately run sectors. For those who want to make a private profit at public expense.As the aim of Brexit is to take back control of our destiny, it would be totally wrong to sell the people out to the EU or the US. We do not want a Brexit deal with the EU which would make it easier for companies to source goods and services from countries, such as the US, where labour standards are lower, or to eradicate workers’ rights, such as collective bargaining and our right to organise, on the grounds that they restrict a company’s business model and its profit margins.Remaining in the single market would make our decision-making process even less democratic here in Britain as we would still be bound by EU directives without having a voice around the table as they are drawn up. Norway, often touted as a possible template for Brexit, incorporates single market rules as they are made in Brussels and Strasbourg. And we should remember that a recent Norwegian government report concluded that, through its single market membership, it is three-quarters integrated into the EU compared to a typical EU member country.And state aid is banned as a distortion of competition under Article . The EU Commission may grant very limited or temporary exceptions but has indicated that it is highly unlikely that these would not be granted to Britain. As we prepare to leave the European Union on  March , we need to ensure that the terms on which we leave – whatever the deal, or no deal, and however it is sold to us by Noel Edmonds, Theresa May, or Boris Johnson – does not leave us in a worse position than we are at the moment – because that wasn’t what we voted for.Mick Whelan is general secretary of train drivers’ union Aslef and a member of Labour’s national executive committee.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Tuesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”Eddie lts gym trophy\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8684387.1540633447!/image/image.jpg","title":"competition win up to 10 tickets for this week s calor ni leisure show","story":"Win tickets to the second annual NI Leisure Show which kicks off this Friday, November  and runs until Sunday, November .

As he was going off, McDonnell reacted to taunts and a plastic water bottle was thrown towards him.This led to punches thrown with several Newington players following him off the pitch as scuffles ensued. Things appeared to have calmed down with the players ing to the field, but the incident then sparked off again as McDonnell was being led to the dressing rooms. Again, players left the pitch, some it seemed were trying to calm the situation rather than join in, but the referee had seen enough, saying afterwards the chaotic scenes were out of control and he had no choice but to abandon the game.What happens now is up to the Co. Antrim FA. The draw for the semi-finals were made on Saturday with East Belfast awaiting the winner of Saturday’s gamethat is to be replayed or not.The Co.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\". He has a dinosaur theme park in Australia and the Titanic project plan has been described as his \"pet project\". A second Titanic II is also being built in a theme park in China. However it will remain docked and not take on sailings.

Its a brilliant country with no bombs and we need to get back to it.\"One of the most impressive designs was an intricate Belfast City Hall that could feed about  people.Creator John Hollidayfrom French Village Bakery said: \"My arm was sort of twisted into doing it. No one  was doing it and when you see the detail on City Hall, the windows behind the pillars at the top and what not, it just gave us a chance to sort of test ourselves and see what we really can do as bakers.\"Shannon More, John Holliday and Lauren Quee with Belfast City Hall by the French Village BakeryTaking  hours to make, John was helped by colleague Shannon More to carve two sponge and buttercream cakes that merged together to make the masterpiece. It even included the lights seen on the building each evening.\"When I looked at the building we had two choices: we could have done a smaller version of the whole City Hall, or just do the front face of it, which everybody recognises, and make it big enough to be able to put some detail into it. So thats what we chose to do.\"The hardest part was just finishing it.\"When it comes to putting it together, after the cake itself is made, theres another eight hours just finishing off and putting detail into it.\"The competition, in association with Ulster Architectural Heritage and Food NI, had  entrants. Judging was based on the taste and detail of the cakes and was split into amateur, professional, group, under-, primary and secondary school class.From the under-s, Katie McKeemade Bellevues Floral Hall because her grandparents met there in .She said: \"I am happy with the way it turned out but it was hard to cover the cake with the fondant. I did the steps and my mum got rice paper and printed out a floral heart and little people and we stuck them on.\"Anna Hamilton , with the help of sister Rachel , made their version of Mussenden Temple.Anna said: \"We made it out of six layers and it is a caramel cake.\"Caramel, then Rice Krispie for the dome so it was lighter for the top of the cake.\"It was quite hard to make and it took us two full days over the weekend.\"We chose the temple as we liked the symmetry of it and the fact that it was contained in circles.\"And we go up to the north coast quite often - so it was just our kind of building.\" Sara OHara and Hollie McBride, from Yellow Door, made St Patricks Catholic Cathedral in Armagh.Sara said: \"It is a huge cake. We started making it on Friday and it took Friday and just this morning to make - so it was a bit of a rush.\"Were glad it came in one piece as we were a bit nervous driving down.\"Were an Armagh company and we drove up from there today with that in the back of the car.\"We didnt make it easy for ourselves, but thats what its all about - a challenge.\"Chef Paula said: \"I think its very important to celebrate our buildings and everyone loves cake so its a genius idea, really, isnt it, to take the two. Ive had a look around and theyre actually amazing. All of them, amateur and professional, and the attention to detail as well.\"The sweetest structuresFirst place in the professional category went to French Village Bakerys City Hall, with St Patricks Cathedral made by Yellow Door Bakery coming second.The primary school category was won by Our Lady and St Patrick Primary School with Ormiston House.Down High Schools Stormont came first in the secondary school category.The amateur winner was Christine McCrudden with a Belfast Terrace.Castle Ward House was the team group winner with Castle Ward House.The under  winner was Catherine Pollen with Palm House and Anna Hamiltons Mussenden Temple was highly commended."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland kkk men posed for photo with national front leaders girlfriend","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

She loved her dress and having everyone there and danced the whole night. She loved her cake and all the party food.ldquoIt was great to be able to share some of the positive aspects of Meganrsquos le with our family, friends and supporters as there has been so much dficulty along the way.It was very much a family affair attended by Meganrsquos siblings, Hannah, Lily and Stuart, great grandmother Mrs Rosaleen Traynor and her aunt Kelly, who provides a lot of her care.Megan will never have the le that she should have had because of her condition.In many ways, even though the Traynors went on to have three other children who donrsquot have the condition, they were robbed of their hopes and dreams for their first-born.But Megan and her parents felt that it was only right that they should include people at the party who have helped them along their journey so far.In  more than pound, was raised to help Megan become one of the first children from the UK to have pioneering stem cell treatment in China.Unlike some other children who benefited from the controversial treatment, it did not cure or help Meganrsquos blindness.But the Traynors believe that it did help Megan in her mental development at the time, although that has now halted.When her epilepsy and major seizures began to impact on her already compromised quality of le, the local community again rallied around in  to help the Traynors create a safe back garden with sensory equipment, complete with a small hydrotherapy pool to help calm her.Leanne knows that they have been blessed with a lot of help, support and generosity from the local community.ldquoAll I know is that there are a lot of very good people in the Downpatrick area who really pull together when people need help, said Leanne.ldquoThey are people who have helped us and raised money, or who helped get us equipment or whatever, every time we needed it. We canrsquot thank them enough.She said that there were too many to name but she would like to make a special mention of local landscape architect Matthew Morrison, who helped with the sensory garden, the charities RNIB, Angel Eyes, and Murphyrsquos Bar who consistently fund-raised, and Downpatrick Lions Club who organised for a gazebo to be used in the garden for Megan.ldquoIn the early days with Megan, we really didnrsquot know what to expect for her. For us all to be able to celebrate her th birthday is something to be really thankful about, added Leanne..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"St Patrick’s Boys’ former site sold  ","story":"THE former St Patrickrsquos Boysrsquo Primary School site in Downpatrick is to be sold.The Down and Connor diocese has confirmed this week that the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site mdash which was vacated in  when the school merged with the nearby Convent of Mercy Primary for girls mdash offers both commercial and residential potential.The sale does not include the adjacent playing fields.Following the merger of the two schools to form Our Lady and St Patrickrsquos which is based at the Convent of Mercyrsquos former base in Edward Street, the former boysrsquo primary was subsequently demolished.At the time of the merger of two of Downpatrickrsquos oldest schools, which marked the end of single sex primary education in the district, it was suggested a new school would be built, with the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site suggested as a possible base.Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin said Downpatrick required an ultra-modern primary school and believed the Education Authority should investigate the full potential of the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site.He also made it clear that local residents and parishioners must be fully consulted about the future development of the former boysrsquo primary school.ldquoIn previous sales of church lands, some church committees carried out a survey of local parishioners to seek their views of the site being proposed for sale. It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

The former Northern Ireland secretary Lord Hain has stood by his decision to name Sir Philip as the businessman at the centre of #MeToo allegations of sexual harassment and racial abuse, which he fiercely denies.

Chris Moncrieff Sir Philip, who has fiercely denied allegations of sexual harassment against him, had used a hugely expensive legal device to prevent publication of his name in the media. How very convenient.People seem to forget that it’s the taxpayer who foots the bill for judges’ salaries, for the upkeep and running of the courts, and the pay of those who work in them, as well as legal aid. So surely he has a right to know how his money is spent So Lord Hain has done them a service. What is the point of having a parliamentary privilege at all,its use is to be deplored by, in this case, the well-heeled and expensive legal eagles Let us not forget, either, that the much-acclaimed British justice system, unlike the National Health Service, is available in certain areas only to the super rich, like Sir Philip. And who would have dared to sue the BBC in the privacy case but some hugely wealthy pop singer like Clf Richard Even the mighty BBC decided against appealing in this case because of the amount of money it could lose. So what chance the little man There are, of course, cases, family matters involving children, for instance, where privacy is desirable. But to allow wealth and power to keep the taxpayer in the dark about other areas of the law is a shameful scandal.And lord Hain is to be congratulated on his bold action. I am sure he can withstand the slings and arrows of outraged lawyers.• Some years ago, a similar situation existed when the press were banned from using the name of a very exalted member of the Establishment who was involved in paedophilia matters.I persuaded a Tory MP, the late Geoffrey Dickens, to table a House of Commons motion naming this man. He did so, and the Speaker of the day didn’t stop it, and so, when the name appeared the following morning in Parliamentary papers, hey presto, it was in the public domain!• I am all in favour of MPs hurling robust insults at each other. But even I draw the line when those ‘insults’ suddenly become transformed into threats of murder.For instance, shadow Chancellor John McDonnell recently said a member of the Tory Government should be ‘lynched’. As far as I am aware, there has been no retraction.Budget generosity to NI might be bid to soften backstop deal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"And Theresa May was invited by an unnamed Tory to bring her own noose to a meeting of Conservative back-benchers about Brexit.Meanwhile, Labour MP Jess Phillips said she would not stab her leader Jeremy Corbyn in the back, but in the front. Later, she explained feebly and pompously that this was a ‘metaphor’ and not a threat. Well, you could have fooled me.And another Labour MP, Caroline Flint has said she has been warned by another Labour Member that she will be “hanging from a rope”she is not careful, over her views on Brexit. Talk about brotherly sisterly love.This is no way to run what is supposed to be a civilised legislature. Those guilty should be shrouded in shame.• There are signs that a Labour Government would ban Members of Parliament from having second jobs. How short-sighted and constraining is that For a start, being an MP is not supposed to be a job, but a vocation. If parliamentarians are to spend the entirety of their tenure as MPs locked within the walls of the Palace of Westminster, then they would have a very blinkered view of the nation and the world at large.Zealots say that allowing MPs to carry on with work outside Parliament would interfere with their duties to their constituents. Nonsense.They could easily cut down on their workloadand nobody would notice anything amiss.It would do no harm to revert to the days when being an MP meant more than just having another well-paid job with plenty of perks, which it has degenerated into today.try catch     .               ..

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %. We also welcome the news that Primark will open again soon as it will serve as a footfall draw to this part of the city which has been devastated. We now look the Chancellor and his budget next week to seecentral government will step up to support the city centre.” The latest footfall figures from the NIRC showed footfall across the city was down by more than % in September.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
