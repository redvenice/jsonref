On the picture is a twig that Sandra passed through the bars of her enclosure to anyone outside willing to interact with her.In 2017, after studying the opinions of biologists and veterinarians about a list of possible destinations for Sandra, including Brazil and Spain, Liberatori decided on the Florida sanctuary, which has 21 orangutans and 31 chimpanzees. Its best-known resident is Bubbles, late singer Michael Jackson\u0027s chimpanzee.Chuckie, Pebbles, Kiki, Pongo, Popi and Tango will be some of Sandra\u0027s companions, according to the website of the center, where she will have much more freedom and space to move about - though not complete freedom since she has never experienced it and it might be dangerous for her.        Sandra shows little interest in the structure of beams and ropes built for her to climb at a zoo in Buenos Aires on Sept. 16. The orangutan is now in the U.S., where she\u0027s expected have a home at the Center for Great Apes in Florida       It has been a long journey for the 33-year-old orangutan Sandra, who was born in a zoo in Germany and moved to Argentina, where she spent a quarter century ago, as shown above on Sept. 3. Now she\u0027s in the U.S., ultimately to live at the Center for Great Apes in Florida         Sandra the orangutan is headed to a sanctuary near Wauchula, Florida, whose mission is to provide a permanent home for orangutans and chimpanzees rescued or retired from the entertainment industry, research or the exotic pet trade. Here shown in her Buenos Aires habitat on Sept. 16In the larger compound she will be able to interact with other animals, and run and climb more freely. A system of elevated tunnels will allow her to explore the area. In the Argentine zoo, Sandra was the only member of her species.Officials at the Florida center have told the judge they sought to arrange the transfer of Sandra to avoid any extreme change in climate: spring in Argentina and early autumn in Florida. And the Argentine eco-park has successfully sent lions and bears to sanctuaries in the United States.The orangutan will be inside the container for a roughly 11-hour commercial flight to the Dallas airport. From there, she will be sent by a truck on a highway to Sedgwick County Zoo in Kansas. She will be quarantined there and if her health checks out she will be sent by highway to Florida.Her Argentine caretakers have trained her to feel comfortable inside the container and will accompany her on her voyage all the way to Florida.Veterinarian Guillermo Wiemeyer, in charge of animal welfare at the eco-park, said the Argentines will advise those in Florida about \u0027her types of training and preferences\u0027 and provide a known presence during her transition.\u0027I am happy, but a bit nervous that everything goes well,\u0027 said Liberatori. \u0027After she arrives in the sanctuary I will visit her. It is going to be a very happy moment for me.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Historic brick mansion built 1760 moved 50 miles BARGE","story":"Share this article Meanwhile, Christian revealed he is planning on renovating the home and adding on an extension - which will cost another $1 million. He says his decision to keep the original home is also about sustainability and a rejection of modern culture. \u0027We look at our society and where we are, and we\u0027re having to turn back and start to think about eliminating one-time use and going back to all of these things,\u0027 he stated. \u0027We are going to need things that are going to last longer than disposable clothes that end up in the ocean.\u0027          The Neeley family fell in love with the dwelling which is known as the Galloway House and was built back in 1760 - before the American War of Independence         The home will now be given an expensive renovation and will perch proudly by the water in QueenstownBaltimore Sun - We are currently unavailable in your region"},{"url":null,"title":"Paul Hollywoods ex Summer Monteys Fullam accuses Bake star dating barmaid","story":"Share this articlePaul Hollywood’s ex Summer Monteys-Fullam furiously accuses him of having relationship with barmaid 17 years his junior – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"George Amal Clooney step New York 5th wedding anniversary day address","story":"Share this articleAmal Clooney Decries ‘Legal Assault on Journalists’ in Powerful United Nations Speech | PEOPLE.comMinister Blok wil IS-strijders in Irak berechten - NRC"},{"url":null,"title":"Disney World Florida launches Skyliner aerial tram transport guests resorts parks","story":"Share this article Each year Disney World visitors take 100 million rides on its entire transit system, said Thomas Mazloum, a Disney senior vice president.No more than 10 people are allowed in each cable car.

Now the West was terrified that another war was looming, and they had no way of knowing what the Red Army was up to.Amid this rising tension, American and British intelligence agencies came under pressure to find a new way to penetrate crucial Soviet communications.The answer they came up with was Operation Gold. The plan was breathtakingly risky yet ingenious: dig a tunnel into Soviet-occupied East Berlin and tap the landline communications which came from the Red Army’s headquarters.The tunnel would need to be 1,476ft long – 20ft longer than the height of the Empire State Building in New York – and extend under and beyond the heavily patrolled border.It would need to intercept a series of cables that ran almost parallel to the border, alongside a major road. The cables lay just 27 inches below street level, making the construction of the tunnel highly dangerous and open to discovery. Clearly, the entire project would have to be conducted in total secrecy. It was the largest covert operation the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) had ever undertaken.         Traitor: George Blake, who smuggled tunnel plans to the KGBBut there was an even more dramatic twist: they were betrayed, and the Soviets knew about the audacious plan before construction even began.The source of the leak was Soviet mole George Blake who, while working for the SIS, smuggled plans for the so-called Berlin Tunnel to the KGB.Blake, who was codenamed Agent Diomid, spent a decade passing Western secrets to the KGB and his torrent of information included, unforgivably, the names of other agents working for the West behind the Iron Curtain.In September 1953, Blake was working at Section Y, a new SIS office in London, where the focus was on the potential for tapping Soviet landlines. As a well-respected member of the team, Blake was trusted with its most high-level intelligence.One day in January 1954, he boarded a double-decker bus armed with confidential notes from an SIS-CIA meeting about the tunnel, and a sketch of the plans. Waiting for him on the top deck was KGB handler Sergei Kondrashev.Stunned by the material’s significance, Kondrashev placed it in his inside jacket pocket. Later he would describe how he ‘felt it burning into my chest’. It was explosive information but it left the KGB with a dilemma. If they attempted to protect their communications or even block the tunnel, Western intelligence agencies would immediately suspect a betrayal – and Blake would almost certainly be an obvious candidate.It meant, astonishingly, that the KGB chose to do nothing that would risk losing their most prolific agent. No one outside the KGB leadership was told about the tunnel or Blake’s role in its discovery. It meant Britain and the US were able to gather a treasure trove of intelligence on a scale never seen before.DIGGING began in Rudow, a remote corner of West Berlin occupied by the Americans, in September 1954. The operation had been three years in the planning by the CIA and SIS, involving precise calculations, practice digs and the construction of a large warehouse to hide the tunnel entrance and the 3,000 tons of soil that would be excavated during the dig.Construction equipment – including steel liner, a mini forklift truck and hydraulics gear – was coated with rubber to minimise clanking noises.Such was the scale of the tunnel that there was scepticism in Washington and London that it could be done at all. ‘No one had ever tunnelled 1,476 feet under clandestine conditions with the expectation of hitting a target two inches in diameter and 27 inches below a main GermanSoviet highway,’ a CIA history later noted.The team set up three six-man crews, digging by hand around the clock, each crew taking an eight-hour shift. They used army trenching tools – short-handled shovels normally used for digging foxholes. Complications were experienced almost immediately. The high water table in the area meant the tunnel had to be constructed much closer to the surface than planned, making it potentially easier to detect.Yet in February 1955, after just six months, it was complete.Now it was time to bring in ‘the Mole’ – an ingenious vertical excavator designed by a team of British Royal Engineers.Working from inside the Mole, the engineers could gently drill into the soil in the roof of the tunnel an inch or two at a time, delicately probing for the telephone cables above. After several tense weeks, the team uncovered the precious Soviet lines.This prompted the arrival of another crack team of British technicians from the General Post Office’s Special Investigations Unit, who had created a ‘tap chamber’ designed to amplify signals intercepted from the cables. Inside the sweaty, claustrophobic chamber at the far end of the tunnel, a ‘spur’ cable was painstakingly attached to each Soviet wire and fed to the amplifiers.Back in the warehouse, translators wearing headphones linked to equipment in the tap chamber listened intently.Suddenly, there was a voice.‘Da?’ the Russian voice asked.‘Tovarishch Polkovnik?’ a second voice replied – ‘Comrade Colonel?’The team had hit the jackpot.A message announcing their success was sent to London and Washington: ‘The baby was born.’It was like finding an oasis in the desert. Suddenly, the Allies had access to detailed information on the Soviet army and air force, weapons, equipment, plans, combat readiness, personnel, and military administration. An industrial-scale operation began to transcribe the 1,300 or so conversations being intercepted every day. Some, such as those which explained new call signs and enciphering procedures, were invaluable. But the most useful calls were those involving high-ranking Soviet officers experiencing problems with their telephones.SIS officer Peter Montagnon recalled: ‘All the normal caution – saying things in a code – would break down, and they’d just discuss what was going on in plain, straight-forward Russian. We’d hear more swear words than anything else.’Indeed, one of the biggest challenges for the translators was coping with the Russians’ astonishingly prolific and creative profanity.A glossary was created, labelled TOP SECRET OBSCENE.Many messages were either ‘dreary as hell’, as Montagnon put it, or mildly amusing, with the Soviets ‘largely talking about sex and the incompetence of their officers’.While some of what was gleaned was heartening, including military shortages and budget problems, other intelligence was troubling.The West learned that the Soviet air force in East Germany had improved its nuclear delivery capability and was armed with new bombers and jet interceptors with airborne radar.But bit by bit, a mosaic was being laboriously created of the Soviet order of battle.It led to the CIA quadrupling its estimate of the USSR’s production of radioactive uranium-235, and concluded the Soviets had the ability to build higher-megaton nuclear weapons.But, of course, the Allies weren’t the only ones keeping a secret. Soviet intelligence had little idea of just how many military, political, and scientific secrets were being lost. Nor did the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who was well aware of the tunnel’s existence.And so while the Russians continued to do nothing, concern grew as the months passed.Khrushchev was coming round to the idea of exposing the tunnel and pinning the blame solely on the Americans, seeing it as an opportunity to drive a wedge between the United States and Britain.It would support the Soviet narrative of the United States being the real obstacle to peace. With the Suez Crisis looming, he was keen to get Britain onside.In April 1956, his order finally came – and that Red Army unit was told exactly where to dig for those ‘damaged underground cables’.About 50 men lined the roadside of the Schonefelder Chaussee highway at 3ft to 5ft intervals in the middle of the night and began to dig down. The taps were disabled after 11 months and 11 days.The Allies considered blowing up the tunnel to prevent the Soviets coming through it, but, fearing the start of a war if Russians were killed, decided to do nothing.They felt sure the Soviets would suppress knowledge of the tunnel rather than admit that Western intelligence was capable of such a successful operation of this magnitude. But there was yet another surprise to come.Not only did the Russians announce the discovery of an ‘American spy tunnel’, but journalists were invited to go and see it for themselves. It was later opened to the public from 9am to 5pm seven days a week, with a free 30-minute guided tour. By October 1956, when Berlin’s most unique tourist attraction finally closed, some 90,000 visitors had toured the tunnel.reaction in the West was not what Khrushchev or the East Germans had expected.The US decided to say nothing, which was widely taken as an admission of responsibility.Western media mostly carried tales of admiration for the Americans’ pluck. Prime Minister Anthony Eden happily embraced the fiction that Britain had played no part in the escapade.SIS were instructed to maintain a tight lid on the country’s involvement. But behind the scenes, the CIA and SIS were conducting an urgent inquiry to determine whether the tunnel’s discovery was by chance – or whether the operation had been betrayed.For Blake, it was a tense time. However, analysis of the tapped conversations failed to reveal any indication that the Soviets were aware of the tunnel. He was off the hook – until the revelations five years later from a Polish defector, Michael Goleniewski, which finally identified Blake as a double agent. He was sentenced to 42 years, but escaped from Wormwood Scrubs in 1966 and made it to the USSR. He is now 96 and lives near Moscow.However, neither Blake’s betrayal, nor the tunnel’s discovery, prevented it from being among the most successful intelligence operations of the Cold War, long before reconnaissance satellites and other sophisticated systems were in use.Its 40,000 hours of telephone conversations continued to be transcribed for the next two years, and remained useful for the following decade.Perhaps the most valuable intelligence of all was evidence that the Soviets were not preparing to launch an invasion of Western Europe – crucial at a time when tensions between Russia and the West constantly threatened to spill over into a real, perhaps nuclear conflict.The information collected in the tunnel protected millions of lives, a benefit that can never be underestimated.© Steve Vogel, 2019Betrayal In Berlin, by Steve Vogel, is published by John Murray, priced £25.

There is wide agreement that the General Election, when it comes, will be determined by Brexit: 61 per cent say that the most important factor in deciding how they will vote will be \u0027getting the right outcome on Brexit\u0027.A total of 8,075 adults were interviewed online between September 12 and 17.  LORD ASHCROFT: The public\u0027s verdict on our political class? They waver between fury and contemptOn the face of it, the Government is in real trouble. The Supreme Court ruling against the Prime Minister follows a succession of parliamentary defeats, defections, expulsions and daily headlines about turmoil and chaos. But it is a good rule of thumb in politics that the noisier it gets, the more it pays to take a step back, a deep breath, and a good look at the bigger picture.My latest research, published today, looks at the fundamentals: how voters have reacted to the drama not just of the past few weeks but the years since the EU referendum, and how this week’s events fit into the longer story.For many people, and not just among those who backed Leave in the increasingly distant 2016 referendum, that story is one of frustration and failure – or, worse, deliberate actions to delay Brexit for as long as possible or stop it altogether.That is the context in which many see the Supreme Court’s decision. Many of the Brexit supporters we spoke to were not so much angered as bemused by the ruling: ‘They seem to have made up a law and found Boris guilty of breaking it,’ as one put it. More telling, for them, is who brought the case in the first place. ‘The people bringing these lawsuits have got money,’ one of our focus group participants observed. ‘It’s like they’ve got an extra vote somehow. They have their own interests and they’re not interested in us at all. Your vote, my vote is meaningless because it can be undermined by people of influence.’  They seem to have made up a law and found Boris guilty of breaking it Nor are they optimistic. While nearly eight in ten Conservative Leave voters agree with Boris that Brexit should happen at the end of October with or without a deal, only one in three think this is the most likely outcome. Nearly a quarter think we will end up remaining in the EU. This being the case, it is not surprising that among those currently leaning towards backing Nigel Farage, the most important attribute a party can have is not competence or even having the right priorities for the country, but that it does what it says it will do.This shows the possible reward – but the potential peril – of the PM nailing his colours so firmly to the Brexit mast. So far, on that score, Boris gets credit for battling on through the furore to uphold the referendum verdict.This comes not just from Tories, and some even told us they were surprised he had turned out to be so principled and determined. Six in ten Leave voters and most of those intending to vote Conservative say they would like to see him refuse to ask for an extension to Article 50 if no agreement is reached by October 19, despite the new legal mandate to do so.He trounces Jeremy Corbyn when we ask who would make the best PM – in fact, Labour Leave voters prefer him to the prospect of their own leader entering No 10. And while many Tory Remainers are nervous about the idea of a No Deal Brexit, they would choose this over a Corbyn-led Labour government by a huge margin, as would voters as a whole, by 48 per cent to 35 per cent.Thrilling though they may have been for constitutional scholars, then, the past few days have changed little in the Brexit debate. People on all sides feel just as strongly as they did before Lady Hale’s brooch became a national talking point. But the Election, when it comes, will be about more than whether and how we leave the EU. Those bringing lawsuits have money - it\u0027s like they\u0027ve got an extra vote ‘Dealing with Brexit in the right way’ certainly tops the list when we ask what people think are the most important issues facing the country. But when we ask what matters most to them and their families, it falls to third, behind the cost of living and the NHS. It is worth remembering that 2017 started out as the Brexit Election, but ended up being about everything else: social care, nationalisation, the NHS – even fox hunting – and the characteristics of the two leaders.There is also the perennial problem of the Conservative Party’s brand. At the last time round, many Labour voters simply could not bring themselves to vote for what they saw as the party of cuts however strongly they agreed with Theresa May that Brexit should mean Brexit. As my research finds, Tory-sceptic voters are taking Boris’s pledges of extra spending on health and the police with not just a pinch but a wheelbarrow of salt.All of these ingredients will go into the next Election, which in turn will not be a single national battle but a series of local skirmishes with each party having to fight on more than one front. Boris must keep Tory Remainers on board while bringing back those tempted by the Brexit Party Jo Swinson will see whether her Remain-in-all-circumstances position plays as well for the Lib Dems in the South West of England as it does in the South-West of London and Jeremy Corbyn’s policy of deliberate ambiguity will be tested to the limit in places as culturally different as Brighton and Stoke. Finally, there is the question of the voters’ stamina. Many Leavers see the endless delays as a campaign to wear them down, and some admit it is working. ‘I find myself going from anger to apathy really quickly,’ one told us.Though people hold strongly to their position and have their personal champions – whether Boris, Jo, Jeremy or Nigel – their view of the political class as a whole wavers between fury and contempt: many are torn not just between parties, but over whether to bother voting at all.It is a wearying saga, and we haven’t reached the end of it yet.Full details of Lord Ashcroft’s research can be found at LordAshcroftPolls.com"},{"url":null,"title":"Why Carrie Symonds conference outfit blue green","story":"Share this article In a further headache for party chiefs, Mr Johnson is now expected to jet to France on Monday for the funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died last week, aged 86.Unless he is forced back to London, Mr Johnson will deliver a keynote speech to 10,000 Tory delegates on Wednesday. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14ab45e70b5553c16a868fa114a5d62096fdc74d/50_102_1998_1199/master/1998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84920c187134cec43baa9f57500124a6","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Forest fires in Indonesia, protests in Hong Kong, climate demonstrations and the World Athletic Championships – the past seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b23cf24f246c8c30090341ec1cb79c64d29b296f/943_983_5343_3206/master/5343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0373749bd2c61e6db119b5df327d4672","title":"emergency cash german banknote designs in pictures","story":"During the first world war and the ensuing economic crisis, many German towns issued notgeld, or emergency money, to combat cash shortages.

He moved to Canada in 1994 and is now professor of Ukrainian history at Harvard University. He has written 13 books, including Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy, which won last year’s Baillie Gifford prize for his haunting account of the nuclear disaster. His latest book, Forgotten Bastards of the Eastern Front, tells the little-known story of Operation Frantic, the only joint US-Soviet operation of the second world war, which saw more than 100 American bombers flying missions from three airbases in Ukraine.What inspired you to tell the story of Operation Frantic now?I grew up behind the iron curtain. The “great patriotic war”, as it is known in Russian, played a huge role in the collective memory and Soviet propaganda. But there was little space allocated to other allies. When I realised there were Americans at airbases in my backyard it was a “wow” moment.How did the airbases come about?There was military logic – but it was more about expectations. The Americans expected a long fight against the Japanese, so they wanted to show Stalin they were “good allies” to convince him to let them establish airbases in the far east. The Soviets didn’t see much advantage in the airbases militarily, but finally accepted the idea, wanting to charm the British and Americans into opening a second front against the Germans. Once the Americans and British had landed in Normandy, Stalin lost interest. And there was a devastating bombing raid on the bases. Also the eastern front moved fast, so they didn’t have the strategic impact they might have had. But symbolically, they were important – especially in signalling to the Germans that the allies were united.How did the sides view each other?The Americans arrived with a great admiration for the Soviet war effort, especially after Stalingrad. This was also a generation shaped by the great depression who knew something was wrong with capitalism a lot had leftist leanings.When the alliance started to come apart, it wasn’t because of ideology. The clash was really about the principles of freedom and tyranny. The Americans didn’t object to socialism, they objected to Stalinism: the surveillance, the secrecy, the lack of ability to say what you wanted to say, and the lies that come along with that. This was a surprise to me. I had expected cultural misunderstandings to be a problem, but they weren’t really.One later wrote: “What we witnessed in the Ukraine was the start of the cold war.” And I think he was right. The US Ambassador to Moscow, W Averell Harriman, and the commander of the airbases, Maj Gen Robert L Walsh, became the first and most dedicated “cold warriors” because of what they had seen inside the USSR.How did the collapse of the USSR change your perspective?The collapse of the Soviet Union followed a decade of profound crisis. There was an economic crisis, but there was also an ideological crisis. There were no true believers left. So when that system fell, there was a sense of relief, initially. But we had no rules no one watching what we were reading. There was also economic chaos – salaries weren’t being paid. But even among historians, we felt we might have turned a page. Russia can go democratic Ukraine can go democratic. It’s the “end of history” with the victory of liberalism! But, as things progressed, it became clear history matters in all the ways you want it not to matter. It’s impossible to turn the page and forget.In many ways Russia’s recent past foreshadows what is happening in the west: industrial collapse, inequality, disinformation, authoritarianism. Are there lessons we could learn?We are seeing a trend for democratic regimes to become less democratic. Putin was there before Trump, of course, but we also see it in Hungary, Poland – all over the world. Russia went through a huge crisis: loss of identity, loss of territory, loss of its status as a great power. It found itself in that place sooner than other countries. But there is a lot in Russian history that helped Putin and those around him to make the choices they did. We are all going through the same moment in history, but I don’t think the political DNA in Britain and the US will allow that moment to become more than just a moment. It goes too much against the grain of tradition in those countries. In Russia, it’s really a continuation of how it has usually been.What are you reading at the moment?Most of what I read relates to my next project. After my book on Chernobyl, I’m interested in all things nuclear, and the climate too. Right now, it’s The Human Planet: How We Created the Anthropocene by Mark Maslin and Simon Lewis.What did you read growing up?Like many of my generation, I looked to the west, but we could only read books the authorities allowed to be translated. These were books that pointed out problems with western society, so your “angry young men” really did fit the bill. The Day of the Sardine by Sid Chaplin, about a teenager growing up in northern Britain, and Room at the Top by John Braine made a big impact on me. They were published in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but they only came to the Soviet Union 15 or 20 years later.What Ukrainian writers would you recommend?Anything by Andrey Kurkov, especially Death and the Penguin. I always found Nikolai Gogol’s Taras Bulba interesting because I am from the same part of Ukraine. And the Ukrainian poet Lena Kostenko made a tremendous impact. She wrote about pre-Russian empire history. If you don’t like what you see around you, you look to other times and places - and if you go back to a time before there was a proletariat then you can see the world in different terms.

Some 150,000 UK holidaymakers are being repatriated at taxpayers’ expense following the demise of the world’s oldest tour operator. On 28 September, a further 16,700 customers were set to be flown home.Hundreds of employees of Thomas Cook Airlines are expected to gather at the conference on 30 September to express their anger. “They won’t be overly political but they feel abandoned by the government,” said a spokesman for the Unite union.A group of workers will then travel to London to protest outside 10 Downing Street on 2 October. Among them is former cabin attendant Emma Boxen, who learned of the collapse via social media. She is owed over £2,000 in pay but says she has not received any official communication from the company. “I can’t afford my mortgage. I have all of my bills to pay. It is just horrible,” she said. Online funding pages are being set up to help former employees with the cost of travel to London, she added.The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has been accused of acting far too late after she set up a taskforce to help those affected. The parliamentary business, energy and industrial strategy committee has announced an inquiry into the role of “corporate greed” in the collapse, focusing on directors’ stewardship of the firm, their pay, and the role of auditors.The collapse of Thomas Cook is likely to wreak havoc on tourist industries around the world, and nowhere more so than Greece, where locals considered the company too big to fail. Manolis Giannoulis, head of the hoteliers’ association in Chania, Crete, said: “It was the second-largest tour operator in Europe. Falling like this proves that anything can happen. The damage is huge, probably in the region of €80m – and that’s only here,” he added. “It’s almost like a national crisis, coming just as our economy is returning to normality.”Over half of Crete’s 2,000 hotels worked with Thomas Cook, and the insolvency left 20,000 customers stranded on the island.Further north on the Aegean island of Skiathos, where Thomas Cook flew 40,000 passengers in the past year, the impact is “just massive,” according to Thodoris Tzoumas, mayor of the island that shot to fame as the setting for the 2008 film Mamma Mia! “I don’t think I can convey how big it is.”As in Crete, hoteliers on Skiathos were owed three months’ payments by the company in what was peak season for the sector. Officials estimate losses of up to €500m countrywide – a staggering amount for a debt-stricken nation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8a488d2e0bea7d573baa8db89188b473b493d4/0_182_5460_3276/master/5460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0614622c259c355f594a8e4cadb7c5c6","title":"end front page falsehoods and regain publics trust press","story":"The postmortem on how we got ourselves into this mess will be long and complex. But at its heart will lie this simple proposition: good democracy relies on good information.What does “good information” look like? We might say: information that is not only true but also believed. And therein lies the problem. We’re no longer very willing to believe almost anybody. Most surveys of trust find very little faith in what government or politicians tell us. But there are also extraordinarily low levels of trust in most media. Nearly two-thirds of people say they can no longer tell good journalism from rumour or falsehoods. This is, to put it mildly, a disaster. Into this vacuum of unbelief and mistrust step liars and peddlers of fantasies. By all means call another referendum or election, but what makes anyone confident that the electorate will make a “better” decision than last time round? And I don’t just mean Brexit.If you are going to put a crucial decision on the future of Britain to a vote of citizens it’s pretty obvious what the proper function of the press should be: to arm them with unvarnished facts on both sides of the argument. We might add: don’t pretend a complex question is a simple one. And: by all means tell us your own view, but save that until you’ve given us the facts.For the past four years – you might say much longer – this is not how much of the British press has behaved. Several newspapers have done the opposite. They pretended Europe was a really simple question. They did not bother to present both sides of the argument. And they appeared overwhelmingly keener on shouting their own views before presenting straight news.The prime minister himself is at the heart of this story. His Brussels years of ever more inventive Euro “scoops” morphed into years as editor and columnist in the service of the tax-shy Barclay brothers. The  reciprocated by becoming Johnson’s greatest cheerleader in his rhetoric-over-evidence rush to lead a do-or-die Brexit. Today it’s often hard to tell whether he thinks he’s dashing off a column or governing the country.But there will, in time, be so much more to examine. The then proprietor of the Express, a former pornographer, writing a cheque for £1m to Nigel Farage at the start of the referendum campaign – thereby effectively signalling the end of the Express as a newspaper. The Sun printing a BeLeave in Britain poster – and duly having to register it as a £97,000 donation to the Leave campaign. Why should the public trust “proper” news when journalists turn propagandists?And then the bullying. The front-page exhortations to “crush the saboteurs”, the denunciations of the “enemies of the people” and the Brexit mutineers. “Dissident” MPs displayed like targets on front pages as though the murder of one of their colleagues counted for nothing. And, lately, the persistent anonymous feeding of anonymous No 10 titbits to journalists, who breathlessly rush them on to Twitter with barely a care as to whether they’re actually true.We could add the mirroring of the current crude demotic political discourse. Quentin Letts, moonlighting in the Sun when he is not entertaining Times readers, calls Lady Hale a “beady-eyed old nanny goat”. Why?Letts went to a decent private school, attended two world-class universities and – when not putting the boot into people who do not conform with his own idea of what the establishment should look like – leads a bucolic life as a deputy church warden in Herefordshire. In the past such figures would have seen it as their role to help people without their privilege to become better informed. Now, Dacre-trained in attack dog menace, he pulls on his bovver boots and joins them.Posh boys being populist is one of the hallmarks of the current state we’re in. Etonians, unironically, give a kicking to “the elites” with a winking eye on next day’s tabloid headlines. Oxford graduates sneer at experts. Dominic Cummings (private school and Oxford) holds most manifestations of post-Enlightenment values in contempt. Letts lets rip with his own form of class war.The new elitism is a deadly form of condescension. Sun readers aren’t there to be informed. Entertained, yes. Inflamed, yes. Infuriated: certainly. But not well informed.Interestingly, the Mail, under a new editor, is quietly turning itself into a much more nuanced paper, willing to do justice to more than one side of an argument. An editorial on Hale was notably reasonable – miles away from the finger-jabbing fury of the previous regime. Sales seem to be holding up just fine (and, I’m told, more than 200 advertisers have returned).Most foot soldiers in journalism do the job because they absolutely believe in the role of good information in good democracies.

Just listen and act on the current best available science,” she said.Thunberg generated headlines around the world earlier this week with her viral so-called “How Dare You?” speech at the UN climate summit, accusing world leaders of betraying her generation.The teenager has inspired millions of youths, drawn to her cause by her passion and a mature, committed rhetorical style that belies her young age.She has also drawn mockery from some, including Donald Trump, who tweeted sarcastically that “she seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future”.Without naming the US president, Thunberg said she didn’t “understand why grown-ups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead”.“We’ve become too loud for people to handle so people want to silence us … We should also take that as a compliment.” Trudeau and other Canadian party leaders took a breather from a tight election campaign to join Thunberg at the Montreal rally – along with around 500,000 protesters, according to organizers.Walking with his wife and children, Trudeau mingled with a boisterous crowd that brandished placards reading “Respect Mother Earth” and “Make America Greta Again” – a riff on a campaign slogan popularized by Trump, a noted climate change skeptic.One man was tackled by security when he appeared to lunge at the prime minister, while 13-year-old Annabelle Vellend broke out in tears when she spotted Thunberg, telling AFP: “I really believe in Greta’s movement.”“She is doing amazing things and it’s great that she’s able to press politicians to act on climate change, during an election,” she said.In his first term, Trudeau cast himself as a champion in the fight against global warming, but his green image was tarnished by his nationalization of an oil pipeline to salvage the construction project after years of delay.The prime minister said after meeting Thunberg and pledging to fund the planting of 2bn trees: “I agree with her entirely. We need to do more.”Earlier this week, the Liberal leader vowed that Canada would reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, joining 66 other countries that have already signed on to the pledge.Last Friday, more than 4 million youths – and adults – rallied in “climate strikes” around the world.Turnout at events a week on was smaller, but still vocal. In Italy, hundreds of thousands of young people took to the streets while an estimated 40,000 protested outside New Zealand’s parliament.In Canada, events also attracted huge crowds in the capital, Ottawa in Toronto and in several other cities.In the heart of the giant Montreal march, made up mostly of children and a few adults, Alexanne Lessard stood out in her tree costume.“I’m here for our future, to show our government that we the majority want to do something and that they can take big steps that will an impact,” she said.Daphnee Choquette said she came out for her baby girl, whom she carried with her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc2b6ae55118d65e5ed3a70fda5009881aa39224/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89a1e64ea3b08aa3903b0c447c169835","title":"sustainability expert michael mobbs im leaving the city to prep for the apocalypse","story":"The man who wrote the book on living off-grid in the city plans to retreat to a rural bolthole, saying eco-friendly progress has not kept pace with the speed of climate collapseMichael Mobbs, you might say, has been preparing for this moment his entire life.The 69-year-old former environmental lawyer who, in 1996, converted his two-storey 19th century Sydney terrace into one of the world’s first inner-city self-sufficient homes, is selling his famous passion project and moving to a remote coastal location to prepare for what he predicts will be impending societal collapse induced by climate change.That is, he says, a total breakdown within the next three to five years.Selling his four-bedroom, off-grid Chippendale property that he purchased in 1978 for $23,500 and is now valued at $2.2m is proving more difficult than he thought. He’s had it on the market since March, but wants to sell it to someone who won’t convert the back yard into a car space, who wants to maintain the Saturday morning house tours that have attracted some 30,000 eco-curious visitors, and who will appreciate the home’s unique perks: two resident Australorp chooks named Pesky and Blanche d’Alpuget less than $300 a year in water and energy bills for a family of four and a leafy street blooming with edible verge gardens.The house also has a water, sewerage and electricity system completely disconnected from the mains: it is powered by solar panels and a battery storage system clean drinking water falls on the roof and is then filtered for storage in an underground tank and an aerated waste treatment system recycles all grey and blackwater, ensuring no raw sewage has left the premises in 23 years.Mobbs is in no massive hurry to sell – he’s yet to acquire that crucial plot of coastal land for his bolthole-to-be. However he does have a new abode in the works that is due for completion in December – a prefabricated, bushfire-proof, fully sustainable home constructed with recycled materials that he’s creating in partnership with Melbourne-based modular housing specialists Fairweather Homes and Lismore-based renewables company 24 Hour Solar Power. Mobbs’ new home will be the prototype the trio use to take on the mainstream building market, showing that sustainable can be both “beautiful and elegant” and “cheaper than business as usual”.“Resilience and future proofing will be built in through an off-grid water and energy supply and robust materials suitable for extreme weather conditions,” explains architect and Fairweather Homes director Paul Adam. “With the climate emergency in full swing we need to create solutions that are affordable and accessible and also make a positive contribution to preventing climate change.”It’s a project that for Mobbs is part retirement nest egg, part departing gift to a decaying planet.Mobbs has narrowed the location for his new home to two sites in Australia: south-west Western Australia and Bermagui on the New South Wales south coast, both chosen because, to put it simply, “wherever there are trees, there is rainfall”. There are, of course, other strategic considerations (but more on that later).First Mobbs has to do something he’s been deferring for a while: go “public”. Coming out as a survivalist who is abandoning the urban world is no easy step for a man who has authored two bestselling books on sustainable city living, spent two decades as a consultant to the public and private sector, lectured at universities, and has a model of his eco-friendly terrace home exhibited at Sydney’s Powerhouse Museum. Even his two adult children, who he says remain frustratingly indifferent to the apocalypse, aren’t fully across his intentions. “I’ve tried to crabwalk into this conversation with my children,” he says, sighing. “The idea that life won’t go on for them in the same way it has gone on for me is incomprehensible.”Mobbs has chosen the night before September’s global climate strike to speak his truth at a “talk and feast” event organised by the community group Transition Bondi. They have invited Mobbs to speak as part of a four-person panel on the topic, “What is your response to climate change?”As soup is served, a real-life emergency is unfolding in the kitchen. An overheated kettle has triggered the fire alarm, forcing everyone to file out of the Margaret Whitlam Recreation Centre at Waverley Oval to the repetitive strains of “Emergency, emergency! Evacuate now!”When the kettle has finally been pacified, Mobbs and the panel take their positions. Mobbs is no stranger to public speaking – quick with a quip and with a lawyer’s gift for the gab – but tonight he’s nervous, clutching printed notes which he reads from slowly.“My guess is water, energy, food, the seasons and economies will collapse in the next three to five years,” he says. “Am I certain of these things? No. But like someone diagnosed with a cancer expected to kill me in the next five years, I am now preparing for my personal circumstances over the next few years. The star I steer by is an article by Catherine Ingram, Facing Extinction.”The audience – who were hoping for a side of hope with their vegan meal – appear stunned. Mobbs, on the other hand, looks relieved.Speaking to  Australia in the days leading up to and following his big reveal, Mobbs admits he sometimes has moments of doubt, where he wonders if he’s just catastrophising. But he reserves most of his incredulity for people who refuse to believe it could happen here.“I don’t debate it any more – it’s just a waste of time. What they’re saying is: ‘I find this too hard to talk about. I don’t want to listen to your point of view,’” he says.It reminds him of the resistance he encountered when he took his inner-city home off grid – the naysayers, the builders, the hydraulic engineers, the local government officials who said it could never be done.We’re sitting near the fireplace in Mobbs’ Myrtle Street terrace looking out through large glass doors to the landscaped back garden with its small beehive, kumquat trees and homes for micro bats. Mobbs is talking about “collapse”, which he fears, when it strikes, could unfold very quickly.“I want to get away from the major cities because I think they’ll become unsafe. You look at what happens in places that get cyclones or tornadoes when the food runs out and it’s hard to get power and water, civil unrest happens in about two or three days,” he says.“People die without food and water in a week, and if there are a lot of people dying or at risk of dying, their behaviour will become uncontrollable.”The nation-state, he believes, won’t come to the rescue. “They will look after themselves and their own. They will appropriate resources to protect their own entitlements. They won’t look after the people who voted for them.”Even this Sydney house won’t withstand the coming crisis, Mobbs says – a point, I suggest, he probably shouldn’t stress to a prospective buyer.He throws his head back and laughs. “I suppose I could put up a warning note: ‘Staying here is life-threatening.’”When, or if, such a situation arises, Mobbs wants to be well off the radar. Does he see himself as a doomsday prepper?“Yeah, I’m looking after me – I want to survive. I doubt that I will because it’s hard to say where the water will or won’t fall.“I’m trying to find somewhere, where even if the great conveyor belt does break down while I’m alive, there are enough trees to out-arm wrestle the ocean and retain the rainfall.”Enter Bermagui, the frontrunner for his haven from climate disaster. The town of 1,500 people flanked by ocean and forest and midway between Sydney and Melbourne first came to his attention during a chance encounter with chef turned urban farmer Paul West, who hosts the Foxtel series River Cottage Australia.Mobbs’ annihilation anxiety can be traced back to his childhood. He grew up on a farm downstream from Forbes in the NSW central west. When he was six the Lachlan River flooded, cutting him and his family off from the world for four months, leaving them reliant on food drops from a Gypsy Moth biplane. It was young Mobbs’ first “experience of the power of water”, giving him an enduring “respect for the unpredictability of the weather”.A number of factors coalesced in the last year to rekindle Mobb’s unease. With his children flown the coop and his marriage long over, he decided to rent out his Chippendale home for a year and relocate to Bondi Beach so he could swim in the ocean at dawn and “see who I was when I wasn’t that guy in that house”.Three months after the move the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its dire report warning the world only had 12 years to avert a climate catastrophe.Standing at sunrise on the golden strip of sand that lures millions of people each year, Mobbs saw a culture that “simply can’t be sustained”.During that year Mobbs also took a 4,352km train trip from Perth to Sydney, a journey he describes as “just four days of dying countryside”. “I travelled through Western Australia across the Nullarbor, through South Australia, down through Broken Hill – the whole of the country is abandoned and dying,” he says.That the mighty, flood-prone Lachlan River of his youth has now been projected by WaterNSW to run dry by March 2020 given no significant rain or government intervention, fills Mobbs with a grave fear.When NSW premier Bob Carr opened Mobbs’ sustainable house on 9 December 1996, he declared Sydney’s first self-sufficient home “a vision of the future”.But Mobbs is still locked in an ideological battle with Sydney Water, which he sees as prioritising desalination plants over home rainwater tanks and wastewater recycling systems. The dwindling H2O levels in his own underground storage system is a daily reminder of the city’s water insecurity – in recent years he’s had to increasingly rely on his neighbour’s garden hose to top up his tank. The latest worst-case scenario projection from WaterNSW is that Warragamba Dam – Sydney’s primary water supply – will stop flowing by January 2022.Next week Mobbs will jump on a bus (he doesn’t own a car) at Central Station and travel eight hours south of Sydney to Bermagui to look for land to buy and establish contacts in a patch of NSW he foresees will be his next home.“It’s hard to work out how to live in the face of impending collapse and my solution – aside from whisky and wine and gardening – is to do things that have meaning for others and to show faith that it’s possible to do this stuff.”One morning that week I receive an email. “Beautiful sound of rain on my tin roof as I write this. More than ever the sound is so gratifying,” he says.He signs off the email with a simple message, but on that saturated morning it rings like a prayer for a parched country.“May the raindrops be with you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d137f97fb22914b574a3841ddd4b976896c7f37e/0_11_2347_1408/master/2347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a66868f2fd589cd3380c1b06a9034282","title":"andreas kronthaler calls time on fashion weeks at westwood paris show","story":"Dame Vivienne’s husband takes top billing in Paris, but the look remains unmistakably WestwoodBackstage at Vivienne Westwood’s Paris show the designer was in typically provocative mood, declaring: “I am not sure how much longer fashion weeks will be feasible for, in the future.” However, that designer was not Westwood herself but her husband, Andreas Kronthaler, who for the past three years has taken top billing at the Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood show.This label remains unmistakably Westwood. It retains both its distinctive look – think 18th-century French punk – and the environmental activism she embraced decades before it became acceptable, let alone fashionable, in mainstream culture. The Dame herself watched Saturday’s show from the front row, and joined Kronthaler arm-in-arm for a catwalk lap of honour.“We have to take sustainability seriously,” said Kronthaler before the show. “I think that is obvious now, no? So I try to be as conscious and as careful as possible.” Much of the raw material for this collection was “fabrics that already exist – it’s called deadstock, although I think that’s a bit of a strange name”. He worked with Wastemark to collect fabric surplus from top Italian mills, “and mostly I didn’t dye the fabric, just washed it and fitted it”.This collection was called Rock me Amadeus. “But really, that’s just about the hair,” said Kronthaler, gesturing to model Bella Hadid, standing patiently in a swimsuit and knee-high sport socks while being accessorised for the catwalk with a vast Dr Seuss hat on top of hair neatly pinned into Mozart-esque rolls above the ears. “I try to put as much into each look as I can. I want each look to be a world of its own.”An oversized black net hat with an elegant elongated shape, somewhere between a very chic crocodile mask and an Admiral’s bicorne hat, had in fact been inspired by rowers who Kronthaler saw carrying their upturned boats high above their heads into the Thames, on a visit to Henley. There were references to 1950s pin-ups and to Fellini’s 1976 film Casanova. And there were plenty of party dresses in the classic Westwood style, with opulent layers unpeeling over bare shoulders, waists cinched with a corset, skirts flounced.“What I believe is that we should buy less and really love the things that we buy,” said Kronthaler.The son of a Tyrolean blacksmith, he met his wife in the late 1980s, when she was a professor at the Vienna Institute for Applied Art and he was her star pupil. Married since 1993, they have been a de facto design team for much of that time. In 2016, the name of the Paris fashion week show was changed to acknowledge Kronthaler’s contribution.He said: “I have reduced the collection to its essence – if people are going to buy less, then I should be making less – and then to stretch it into a show I make some pieces with fabric that is dormant around the studio.” A box of scrapped sequins found in a cupboard became an one-off sparkly fish, worn as an enormous hat, and embellishment for a T-shirt dress with the face of a tiger, to support the work of Fauna and Flora International, the world’s first international wildlife conservation organisation, in their mission to protect the critically endangered Sumatran tiger, of which fewer than 400 are estimated to remain in the wild."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6831f2f8ba18e15e9da8599f0af3de7fa2b1f73f/0_78_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a56bfde77c6c4debc2bf678da011fe","title":"lady hale spider brooch launches global trend","story":"The past month has seen fashion weeks in London, New York, Paris and Milan.

Then the celeriac mingles with the starch released from the rice to become creamy – an excellent quality in any dairy-free risotto.Nutritional yeast, or “nooch”, is a strange and wonderful ingredient to play around with.

Real Madrid’s fans once famously held up a mock classified advert requesting a “worthy rival for a decent derby”, and they got it: Real arrived at the home of their city rivals having won just two of the last 15 meetings between these two teams and they didn’t win this one either.That they departed reasonably satisfied with another draw – Real have still only lost once in their last eighteen visits to the Vicente Calderón and the Wanda politano – reflects how much things have changed, how distant those days seem now. It also reflects the fact that with this result, they remain top of the league.Between them, these sides spent almost €600m in the summer, but they produced a game of few chances, in which both managers looked for a way through but appeared more concerned with the other man not finding it.The last time the teams met, it finished 7-2 to Atlético in New Jersey. “What happened, happened,” Zidane had said what would happen now would be different, everyone knew. This was tighter, tenser, and meant more it was always likely to be, as was reflected in the inclusion of Federico Valverde in Real’s midfield in place of James Rodríguez. Within five minutes, Sergio Ramos left João Félix on the floor – and gestured for him to get up again. This was a battle for control which no one really won.If there was a broad first-half pattern it ran: Atlético, Real, Atlético. João Félix shot wide when Diego Costa sent him running clear. Hazard escaped up the left, but his cross was cut out. And fairly harmless shots from Karim Benzema, Nacho and Toni Kroos drew three corners in little over a minute. Kroos then took the ball beautifully on the bounce, sweeping a bending, side-footer from 20 yards that Jan Oblak ed to push away.In the middle of it all, Thomas Partey was the game’s outstanding midfielder and he sent a superb cross through the six-yard box which Costa couldn’t quite reach. He also retook control and, as Atlético advanced again, it was Kieran Trippier they most often sought. A wonderful pass from Thomas found him in the area, free. Options didn’t quite open before him, at least not with the speed he hoped, and Courtois reached out to stop his low ball seeking out Koke at the far post.Thomas it had been too who teed up João Félix to hit a shot just wide from the edge of the area. Opportunities were limited, though, and Diego Simeone made his first change at the break, Ángel Correa replacing Vitolo and immediately dashing in to head over Costa’s chipped pass.Correa brought electricity but it was Real who had the first clear chance when Eden Hazard found Nacho overlapping. Nacho’s cutback ran towards Gareth Bale, thundering into the area and the perfect shooting position. He opened up his body and hit the ball bending high into the south end, the roar from the fans there speaking of relief.At the other end, Trippier’s cross – his ninth of the game – only just evaded Costa. Both sides looked for solutions, albeit without running excessive risks, and the changes came: Thomas Lemar, Luka Modric, Marcos Llorente, Rodríguez. In Atlético’s case, the changes were especially significant: Koke changed sides, Saúl went to left back, and Correa moved from right to centre. And yet the game didn’t move much, even though Modric immediately sent a ball across the face of goal. Saúl headed Koke’s corner just past the post.Then Nacho’s inswinging cross was met by Benzema, but Oblak ed full length to make a sharp save low by the post. Lemar, Correa and Trippier combined to reach the byline but Koke couldn’t turn the shot goalwards at the near post. At the south end, they sang. On the pitch, they couldn’t score."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d792d3fe7a5fdcc679371e569d3cead1c95296d/12_369_2183_1309/master/2183.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4d6c4f8ca3a9d601af933a26bf44e9b","title":"manchester city bernardo silva tweet joke victor anichebe","story":"Raheem Sterling joined his manager in defending Bernardo Silva against accusations of racism arising from his controversial tweet comparing Benjamin Mendy to a cartoon character from a Spanish advertising campaign, but their views cut little ice with the former Everton striker Victor Anichebe.Pep Guardiola told Sky Sports after Manchester City’s 3-1 win at Everton that racism needed to be fought every day but that the media had treated Silva unfairly. Sterling said: “Bernardo made a joke to his friend. He’s not referred to his skin colour , he’s not referred to his lips. They’ve both got small heads …“It’s really sad to see someone like Bernardo, the whole week be kind of down about it, because he’s not that way inclined … They’re two really good friends, it’s really sad to see.“Bernardo’s deeply sorry about it.

When you post something like this it opens up and invites other people to also joke about these things … that can spiral. Bernardo Silva will know he’s in the wrong now … I don’t think that he should do this and the way City have handled it I think it’s a joke … kind of saying that the media should focus on other things.

It highlighted for me one of western Europe’s greatest assets: an easily navigable terrain abounding in attractive and erse flora. We British islanders have an intrinsic affiliation with these plants: our flora is cut from a similar cloth – only the patterns of the cloth become more varied and splendid across the Channel.So when I was invited to join my in-laws for a week in northern Italy this summer, I persuaded my wife that we should drive, rather than fly, to enjoy some of the magnificent floral landscapes our continent has to offer – and find inspiration for our own back garden.Thankfully, I had economics on my side: seasonal flights were astronomical, and the substitution of a tent for pricey hotels would more or less balance out the petrol costs. But there was also a certain hankering – exacerbated by Brexit turmoil – to revisit the continental family road trips fondly remembered from my childhood: the exotic road signs, open views and cheesy croissants.Ferry crossing booked, campsites reserved and the car hastily equipped with regulation EU breakdown accessories, we left London for the white cliffs.

Our tent erected outside the scenic ski town of St Moritz, I scrambled back to find a few earmarked species: alpine willowherb, gorgeous orange arnica daisies and little orchids. The true gems, however, hunkered low and damp with cloud, were the intricate flowers of Sempervivum montanum. Britain’s flourishing succulent obsession has brought houseleeks to the fore, admired for their fleshy leaf rosettes. The ephemeral flowers, however, are rather special: stars of mauve-pink with acid green centres. As hardy alpines, sempervivums perform best in a small garden pot, placed in full sun, with lots of grit for drainage.I’ve grown increasingly fond of the border regions of northern Italy, with their blend of cultures, rolling scenery and labyrinthine little roads. Lombardy and Trentino-Alto Adige, whose hills are alive with the sound of Austrian cowbells, were awash with bewilderingly beautiful flower meadows as we passed – floral carpets studded with sainfoin, salvia, yellow rattle and scabious. Perennial meadows such as these require patience to establish, but in the right conditions they can be enormously rewarding, both visually and for wildlife. To start your own wildflower meadow, visit pictorialmeadows.As widely reported, 2019 has been a bumper year for painted lady butterflies in Britain. Once every decade, this annual migration through Europe swells in magnitude spotting painted ladies along the trip therefore became something of a game, spying them alighting on thistles, nettles and other flowers. This astonishing journey is dependent on the availability of such “weeds”, urging us to reconsider their eradication from our gardens. Thistles, for example, are a vital food source and host plant for the painted lady.The final leg of the journey arched down towards the Veneto, through a landscape familiar from a visit earlier this year. In spring, this region’s woodland trails had been adorned with aquilegia, helleborine orchids and wild strawberry flowers. These blooms were now succeeded by papery seedheads and, for the strawberry, by fruit. Of Europe’s copious native flowers, the wild strawberry has to be among the most beloved, but it is equally at home in the garden as in the hedgerow, offering ground cover, the surprise of fruit and delicate, understated petals. Wild strawberry is a fantastic plant for moist soils in full or partial sun, where it may naturally multiply with vigorous runners.On the ferry home, I flicked through my notebook and totted up the plants I’d seen. Interestingly, one particular species made several appearances: the unassuming common ivy, Hedera helix. When not climbing stucco walls or swamping woodland, it was employed as an underplant for trees and shrubs, clipped neatly at the edges. This is nothing new (it is a staple of Italian gardens) but a practice somewhat undervalued. If pruned back regularly and thus prevented from feral wanderings, ivy shelters roots from a hot sun, suppresses unwanted seedlings and provides a tranquil green canvas: a truly “continental” effect.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication).

What I find so particularly interesting is the sense of calm that pervades all things Japanese. On top of that, I am struck by how in Japan modernity mingles seamlessly with history. The Japanese manage to convey the sense that they are able to look both backwards to tradition and forwards to the unknown future with equal ease. This is quite a cultural accomplishment.In 1981 my interest for the Japanese aesthetic, fuelled by a steady diet of Utamaro and Kurosawa, of old and new, went full-blown in one of my most iconic collections – an epic commercial fail, truth be told. Since then, my fascination with the country has grown steadily. Many of my collections have been influenced by Japan, from that 1981 collection to “Hommage au Japon” in 2011, which was an all-Japanese couture collection, from tables to chairs, lamps and ceramics. I cannot choose which is my favourite, though: would you choose one of your siblings over another? I feel a sense of continuity with this world. Looking at Japanese artefacts might help me create a new detail, opt for a texture or a shade. I never do that literally, however: I like nuance.When I go to Japan I always visit the Mori Art Museum – which showed the travelling retrospective of my work in 2005, organised by the Guggenheim. 21:21 Design Sight is another place I really like, created by Issey Miyake, a Japanese designer I truly admire for his innovative and profoundly human touch. I like Le Corbusier’s National Museum of Western Art – it is the only building in east Asia by the French modernist master, impressive both inside and out.By contrast, and I know that it is a favourite tourist attraction, I am very fond of the 7th century Sensō-ji Temple in Asakusa, which is Tokyo’s oldest temple, I believe. It’s exactly what I imagined a Japanese temple to be like before I saw one in person – all ornately decorated wood and slightly curved, tiered roofs and lots of red! As for food, I recall some restaurants in the small alleys in Shinjuku where I had some of the best Japanese food ever. These tiny streets, rammed with minute eateries that only seat a few people, are remarkable, unpretentious and authentic. Once, looking at a chef making sushi for me felt like watching an artist at work.In 2001, for the ArmaniTeatro exhibition space in Milan, one of my most ambitious projects, I collaborated with Japanese master architect Tadao Ando. I first discovered his work in a book I was given as a gift. I was won over by the purity in his architecture, his meticulous use of materials and, above all, the dialogue between water and light, which reminds us that nature is never far away. I find this extremely telling of Japanese culture.I think Japanese design has evolved, while keeping its signature soulful minimalism. In fashion, the new generation of designers is pursuing a lively, almost chaotic aesthetic that is very far from the gloomy black of their predecessors. Japan moves fast, creatively and otherwise, but at the core always keeps its soul, and that is fascinating for me.What brings me close to Japan is a shared love for clean and vibrant lines, which can be found in my collections. I admire the respect for tradition that in Japan comes together with modernity – it mirrors the way I have honed my own stylistic codes in accordance with the times but not giving into fleeting trends. So yes, it is a natural fit. I would even go so far as to say that the Japanese are more “Armani” than Armani!

When pressed by her co-presenter she added that the US president’s remarks made her “furious”.Last week, Munchetty was judged to have broken the public broadcaster’s editorial guidelines on impartiality.Maitlis told an audience at Cliveden literary festival in Taplow, Berkshire, that the BBC had set “a semantic and linguistic conundrum” for itself by ruling that, while Munchetty was within her rights to describe Trump’s tweets as typical examples of racism, she had been wrong to imply the person who wrote them was racist.“Now, I’ve tried to practise that in the comfort of my own home. I think it’s complicated. The point is that the BBC, the complaints body, is trying to work its way through a semantic and linguistic conundrum, that they end up looking as if they have their heads down in this Dickensian ledger of for and against, or good and bad.”A BBC spokesperson said: “The statement from the executive team is clear, the BBC is not impartial on racism. Racism is not an opinion and it is not a matter for debate. Racism is racism.”Maitlis’s criticism comes after high-profile writers and journalists wrote to the  urging the BBC to reconsider. The ECU’s findings have also now been referred to Ofcom, the national media regulator.This weekend the novelist Philip Pullman and the former children’s television presenter Floella Benjamin joined the angry response to the BBC’s decision on Munchetty.Pullman, 72, tweeted: “The BBC is being timorous in the Naga Munchetty case. She’s right and they are wrong.”Benjamin, 70, who was one of the first black women to appear regularly on British television in the 1970s and 1980s, said she was dismayed by the ECU’s decision.Tony Hall, the BBC’s director general, attempted to clarify the situation on Friday in an email to staff. He said the corporation “was not impartial on racism” and that he and his fellow executives admired Munchetty for speaking out.Maitlis said this highlighted the confusion. “My worry is that the complaints body looks as if it’s massively out of touch with the real world,” she said.“You have a woman of colour in a prominent position in a main news outlet, who is a presence, but not allowed to be a voice. That’s a difficult place for a complaints body to be. It shouldn’t be my colleagues and people of colour who are having to come out and say this, it should be anyone and all of us.”Earlier this month the ECU upheld a complaint about Maitlis “sneering and bullying” during a Newsnight discussion with the newspaper columnist Rod Liddle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20f920f5ed52e0403de8d4812f40b4c69dc83ba/449_312_917_550/master/917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e454c78ecc22cc87c41ec54937db71ce","title":"you never forget the first time how i lost my investment virginity","story":"Many of us have the sense that our money could be doing more than sitting in a savings account, albeit with some apprehension about what else to do with it. But for Danielle Graph, becoming a first-time investor was less scary than it seemedI’m a control freak. It isn’t my most endearing quality, but it does mean that when it comes to things such as life admin and money matters, I try to heed the girl scout motto and be prepared for every eventuality. But, for some reason, I’ve never tried investing before.I’m lucky enough to have a few work-based pensions, which will apparently provide me with a grand sum of £365 per month to help me heat my home and fill my shopping trolley, once I’m of retirement age. And because I’m constantly thinking and worrying about the future, whenever I’ve found myself with any financial headroom, I’ve been diligent about saving.At the moment, though, I’m finding that, week-by-week, I’m just getting by. I work for a website part-time and my husband is in the luxury goods market, which has been hit by the recent economic uncertainty. Plus, our cost of living just seems to keep on rising – our car, our kids’ after-school clubs, even our cats seem to be getting more expensive.So I’ve decided to try to improve our financial future by dipping my toe into the big wide world of investments. This is completely new territory for me. My only experience of investment pretty much extends to watching Damian Lewis in Billions. Indeed, when people tell me that they “invest”, I can’t help picturing a 1980s yuppie in pinstripes and braces, shouting “loadsamoney” into a brick mobile phone. Can this really be for me?I start researching investments online: the words float across the screen like a different language. I wonder to myself why I’ve never tried investing before? Perhaps it has something to do with my control-freak tendencies? And yet, deciding to invest actually feels like taking control. So, undeterred by some of the jargon I encounter online, I take £1,000 out of our stagnant savings and resolve to try and make it grow. Watch out Wall Street, this twice failing maths GCSE pupil is coming for you.No matter how much I psych myself up, however, the shameful truth is I still have no idea where to really begin. So I turn to my bank, HSBC, and phone its investment helpline. I kick off my chat with the super helpful specialist by asking her to explain everything as if she’s talking to a five-year-old. I tell her I have £1,000 to invest, where do I start? (Though it’s worth noting that you can start investing in some places from only £100.)For a Joe Average like me, the specialist explains that this isn’t some get rich quick scheme, but instead to think about this for the long term – at least a five-year timeframe. Mentally, I start planning a family holiday to Disney World five years down the line. She then checks that I’ve got an emergency fund in place for dealing with any unexpected expenses. Next, we chat about how I might make the best decision for me, where I’d feel most comfortable putting my money and about the various investment options that are available. I make notes – lots of notes. It’s a lot of information to absorb, but once I have the basics, I hang up the phone and bolster what I’ve just been told with information from HSBC’s website, where everything is clearly covered. Then I phone back the helpline with further queries. This approach seems to work best for me, and gives me the best of both worlds: the personal touch over the telephone, plus the chance to supplement what I learn in my own time and at my own pace. Helpfully, everything I’ve discussed with the specialist is available online, including a timely reminder that, when it comes to investments, I may not get back what I put in – along with a brilliant jargon buster which has found itself a special place in my bookmarks toolbar.I focus on three distinct investment options. The first involves opening an account to buy shares in inidual companies – companies whose shares are publicly traded in the stock market. I keep visualising shares as if they’re slices of one giant pizza – the publicly-traded companies get sliced into so many pieces, and you then can buy a slice, or a few slices. Of course, it would have to be the world’s biggest pizza given the sheer number of shares that are typically issued. Plus, it starts making me hungry. The second option involves putting your money into a fund-based investment. A fund is basically a group of investors who collectively put their money together in one basket, and that money is spread out, across a whole range of investments.Thirdly, you can invest in a portfolio, which is basically a collection of different funds.All of these options can also can be undertaken via a stocks and shares ISA (Inidual Savings Accounts). The benefits of an ISA are that you don’t pay income or capital gains tax on what you earn, but you are limited to a maximum of £20,000 investment per year. You can split your ISA allowance between stocks and shares, and cash – a cash ISA being similar to a savings account that offers instant access to your money. A stocks and shares ISA could potentially earn you more money than the alternative, however, there is a greater risk attached, as your money is invested in stocks and shares, which can go down, as well as up.As one of my cats peers over the top of my laptop, meowing for yet more food, she reminds me of all our day-to-day expenses and why I need to try and secure a better financial future for my family. Taking in two kittens from a cat shelter seemed like the best idea at the time, but I had no idea they’d bump up our monthly costs by a rather massive £100, for cat food, litter and insurance.Now that I’m armed with decidedly more knowledge than when I started, I brew a strong cup of Earl Grey, crack open a packet of shortbread and mull over how I want to lose my investment virginity. I decide I don’t want any additional tax worries (who does?) which is why I’m going down the ISA route. I’m also looking for an investment that doesn’t require any work on my part, which is why I opt for something HSBC calls a “managed” solution, which means they take care of managing my funds and keep me updated in regular statements. I choose a stocks and shares ISA which invests in funds, rather than the alternative which invests in shares on the stock market. For the final step, I go through an online process using HSBC’s My Investment tool, which involves answering multiple, intricate questions about my finances, assessing if I can afford to invest, and delving deeply into how I feel about risk. The depth of the questions reassures me rather than puts me off – and it’s been written in a plain, easy to understand language. The tool processes my answers and conclude that I’m a person who’s comfortable with risk – so I opt for the high risk portfolio it recommends.The cost of setting up my ISA is £7.50 with an estimated* £4.50 per annum account fee. It’s been surprisingly straightforward and I bask in the positive feeling of having taken some control over my money. In fact, when I log in to my online banking app moments later, there sits my ISA account, holding my £1,000. I take a mental picture of the moment. After all, you never forget your first time.To invest or access investment advice through HSBC you must be and existing HSBC UK current or savings account customer.

Are Britons planning enough?Everyone has different financial goals with different ultimate aims – from launching a business to buying a house to investing for a better retirement. But how many of us have the right structures and plans in place to actually reach them?Many of us leave planning for our future too late, even though our longer-term goals often require longer-term arrangements. In addition, we tend to put our cash into property instead of financial products, partly because of the cultural importance attached to home ownership in the UK – with getting a foot on to the property ladder widely viewed as a key milestone. Others buy property as an investment, which can generate a rental income and may grow in value. But we’ve also seen property prices fluctuate, which can affect short-term liquidity, so this needs to be carefully considered from every perspective.We hit the streets to find out about people’s financial goals and whether or not they had put in place plans to make those goals happen.Providing for family was a big priority for many. With the rising costs of obtaining a university degree, and less secure work prospects for the next generation, some are feeling less certain about their children’s futures. “My goal is to put my daughter through university and to pay for her education. She wants to study fine art and to do a foundation course initially, so that’s the biggest thing I’m funding at the moment. I do have a financial adviser who I see now and then, who has given me advice on the best way to invest. I have a plan in place – although I’m not sure how much it will cost exactly. As a self-employed worker, finances and pensions can be complicated, but I’ve been investing into a pension since my 20s. In hindsight I probably should have invested in property!”“As a nurse who has worked in A\u0026ampE for a long time, I’m all about living for the moment and spending time with loved ones. Financially, I am stable and have put money aside for my children if they need it. I also have a few months’ wages saved up, in case something breaks in the house. But that’s it – I don’t believe in making big goals and saving up for very expensive things I don’t need.”For more information about saving for your children, go to HSBC’s saving for children guideThe majority of the people we spoke to mentioned buying property and owning a flat or house as their primary goal. For many it seems to offer the security of housing, as well as a form of investment.“I’m about to move to Sweden and I’d like to buy a property there with my partner, which might be fairly expensive. My partner and I are savers, definitely. We already have the money saved up for the purchase and I don’t have any debt. I have only ever used my credit card for things like flights and tend to use cash a lot, to avoid spending unnecessarily. I used to shop a lot but that’s changed – I don’t want to be in debt and overpaying for things I don’t need.”“My goal is to get a mortgage, so I can finally get on the property ladder – but I was recently made redundant, which wasn’t on the cards. It wasn’t great, but the plus side is that I was given a good redundancy package and I already had some savings. My uncle is an independent financial adviser, so he has given me help to get the ball rolling, but my main task is to find a new job.”For more information about securing your first home, go to HSBC’s first-time buyer’s guideOther respondents want to put money away to set up their own businesses – from marketing agencies to pizza joints. According to them, the freedom and independence that comes with running their own venture is the primary draw.“I want to run my own marketing company in Spain – where I’m from – once I graduate, so I’d say that’s my financial goal. Once I’ve done my master’s, I’ll start to save up money for the business. I’ve been asking my parents for money a lot lately, so I do need to have a proper plan in place – it’s just difficult when you’re studying and don’t have much free time. I’m really looking forward to the independence working for yourself brings, and I really like the idea of being challenged creatively.”For more information about finding the right finance for your business, go to HSBC’s guide to business borrowingSome respondents had very specific goals in mind as well as specific measures to help to fund them.“My aim this year is to finish paying for my extension and landscape gardener! I’m retired, so I spend a lot of time at home and in the garden. Last year, I downsized from a larger house to a smaller one, so I have the money to pay for it, which is lucky. I don’t have a mortgage or any huge outgoings and I’m pretty good at staying on top of my finances, but obviously these things cost money. My old house had a stream running alongside it, so I’d like a water feature in my new home, too – that’s the plan, anyway.”Another challenge for millions of people across the nation is dealing with accumulated debts. Getting on an even keel financially is the obvious springboard to building a more secure future, so getting out of the red and into the black is a common goal.“I’m determined to clear my debts. I’m already putting plans in place to do that over the next few years, including the four-month project management course I’m currently enrolled on. It can be difficult working and studying at the same time, but my goal is to land a job in the project management sector, and hopefully start to earn more. That should mean I’m able to find my way out of debt by making regular payments.”For more information about repaying your debts efficiently, go to HSBC’s guide to repaying your debts.Bear in mind, the value of investments and any income they generate can go down as well as up, meaning you may not get back what you invest.Whatever your goals and no matter your level of confidence with investing, HSBC could help you make better-informed decisions and could help you plan better.

The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen.

Jo Richings, 50, a business coach, author and speaker from Bristol, says she’s keen to invest but is flummoxed by the options available, and she admits she doesn’t have the time to spend researching the alternatives.“At the moment, half of my savings are in the bank and the other half is held in premium bonds, so there’s no interest being made,” she says. “I’m quite risk-averse when it comes to stocks and shares, and don’t know much about what to invest in. I know I need to do more but I haven’t got the patience for it.”However, the current economic climate means it’s more important than ever to take a long-term view on our financial futures, whether it’s saving for – and then living through – retirement, or simply making sure loved ones are taken care of, argues James Hewitson, Head of Wealth and Advice at HSBC. But, he notes, many people think investing is not for them because they believe they are not wealthy enough.“This comes from a common misconception that you need a lot of spare cash to start investing,” he says. “Others simply don’t know where to begin and even if they look into investing themselves they encounter technical jargon – which is a major turn off.”HSBC is taking steps to help its 38 million customers worldwide manage their day-to-day finances and save for the future. The bank aims to break down those barriers stopping people from investing and instead provide a wide range of modern and accessible tools with 247 help whenever customers want and need it. These include My Investment, where customers can create and access tailored investment advice starting with £1,000, in just a few minutes, and InvestDirect, an easy-to-use system with access to a range of shares and tools to help the selection process. For those not sure if they are ready to invest, the bank has a try-before-you-buy function, allowing consumers to gain confidence by road testing the stocks and shares market as a virtual investor before deciding to go ahead.These financial planning and investment services are available to many millions of customers, from those who are starting out with a few hundred pounds to put away for a rainy day, right up to people who are ready to retire and want to know how best to invest their pension pots.“As our services are one part of a customer’s broader banking relationship, we can provide help and support on all aspects of a customer’s financial life – not just savings and investments,” says Hewitson.Plan for the futureInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.

Then her Boiler Room set happened. Fewer than 100 people were invited to see the 26-year-old play a studio in Hackney, but millions watched online Sherelle went viral. The jungle and footwork music specialist is now one of the most talked about talents in club culture: two agents, her own record label, and a residency on BBC Radio 1 have followed.“I amassed thousands of followers overnight,” she told the Observer. “Some of them were DJs and producers who I love and respected for years. My mind was blown.”Boiler Room’s founder, 34-year-old Blaise Bellville, describes his company as “an independent music platform and cultural curator”, one that connects underground club culture to fans worldwide via the internet. The premise is simple: Boiler Room organise a wildly oversubscribed party, film the DJ playing a live set and then broadcast it online. More than two million people have subscribed to the YouTube channel, while three million follow the shows on Facebook. Now, nine years since Bellville says he “stuck a webcam on a wall at a warehouse party and streamed it on the internet”, Boiler Room is launching its first festival in Peckham next month.But how big has its impact on the industry really been – and is it still credible? “It’s massive,” says Jaguar, a DJ and broadcaster. “So many people have been able to make their careers on Boiler Room. I guess we live in such a digital visual age, it’s more fun than sticking on a regular DJ mix on Spotify. It’s much more engaging, it’s like you’re at the rave: you can sip on some drinks with your friends in your living room, put on your favourite DJ in the world and see their energy and craft. Pre-raving is a great time to put on a Boiler Room.”Translating the raucous energy of a cutting-edge set from the live event itself to an audience watching online may seem an unlikely proposition, but Boiler Room has spawned a number of competitors – Mixmag’s The Lab, and Slipmat.io to name but two – and has big brands lining up to sponsor its events.“We pride ourselves on having our ears to the ground,” says Tom Wiltshire, head of music. “We cover lots of genres, but it’s about DJs who are pushing boundaries.” The most successful events, he says, are “about creating an atmosphere that feels a bit lawless, a bit loose – not dangerous in any way – but allowing people to have fun and express themselves. We make sure we set it up so that when you walk into the room, people are dancing – and all over the place, not just peacocking around the DJ. That’s what you want to create.”One DJ, who wants to remain anonymous, says that Boiler Room “definitely changed the game in all sorts of positive and negative ways” but that for a while “they became sort of a joke when they had 20 streams at any one time from some techno festival or another. But, in recent years they’ve tried to turn it around by bringing younger crews platforming niche scenes. And they have succeeded, so they do feel relevant again.”Ahmad has played a Boiler Room set before. “It’s nerve-racking being on camera, but it’s a pinnacle for you to say you’ve done it in your career. They’ve always bridged the gap between championing the underground and making it accessible to see your favourite artists: if you’re watching at home, which I’ve done so many times, to be able to see the skill, and feel the energy, of a set in the intimate way they film is a big pro. The con is always the trolls, who target women DJs especially. But how do you control the internet?”Belville, who was born into an aristocratic family that went bankrupt when he was four, has been a force within the music industry since he was in his teens, setting up All Ages festival, then the influential music magazine Platform, before Boiler Room took off. “We started as a way of championing what was happening in London electronic underground music scenes to people who didn’t have access to it, who weren’t growing up in cities like London or New York,” he says.The biggest event they have put on had 5,000 people attend in Montreal last week. “Most events are over-subscribed,” says Wiltshire. “The worst was a 1,000-capacity thing where 12,000 people applied for tickets.” Wiltshire is keen to distance the brand from its associations with electronic dance music (EDM) in the US. “We’ve always been anti-EDM, it’s not what we stand for – that’s dance music designed to be very commercial and it’s fallen off a cliff now, whereas the music we’ve championed for 10 years has always stayed on its course.” So what’s the biggest trend worldwide now? ‘Hard dance!” Wiltshire laughs. “Different territories are having different moments but the resurgence of very fast dance music – gabba, hardcore, jungle, what was big in the 90s – is huge with young people now, not just in places that have always been ahead of the curve but eastern Europe in particular.”As for what comes next, Wiltshire is excited by the ground laid by third-generation diasporas: “Reggaeton, for instance, is a massive sound from central and south America. Because of the expansion of those diaspora communities, it’s permeating club culture.”One of the most original, homegrown talents on the circuit with a one-off ear for global party music mixing grime, Bollywood and dancefloor specials, Manara tore the roof off with her debut Boiler Room set. Worth a watch if only for the cameos from the Night Slugs and BBC AZN DJ crews taking selfies in the crowd.The South Korean DJ and producer grew up raving as a teenager in London’s Plastic People and Corsica Studios and moved to Berlin to spend most weekends in Berghain. DJing was the next logical step and this set of electronic realness shows why she is one of the most exciting talents in dance musicAt the point before both acts began producing top-ten chart anthems, this set from a suite at the W Hotel put Skream and the Disclosure brothers on a giddy back-to-back of spacey deep house, post-dubstep, party sounds. Great for bouncing around to.There are several Goldie performances to choose from but this, a fully 90s set of jungle and drum’n’bass from its most famous champion, is a delight. The crowd don’t match the energy of Sherelle’s iconic set but this is a stellar run-through of classics.With 42 million views on YouTube alone, this is the most-watched Boiler Room set of all time, from one of the most revered legends of the business. Cox, a master at work, has been at the forefront of house and techno scenes for more than 30 years. Naturally, he still delivers pure joy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/938a1c5346d5c1e72b7beaa60fa76bc4d564721a/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2de72c8d803a79dae2cd724ad7ce271","title":"labour manifesto just how radical schools health","story":"It started with an attempt to topple the deputy Labour leader and was marked by noisy in-fighting over the party’s Brexit policy. Yet by the end of Labour’s annual conference in Brighton, senior allies of Jeremy Corbyn believed that they had paved the way for the most radical election manifesto seen in Britain for decades.So many announcements were planned that one key policy – the decision to radically reshape universal credit and pump some £3bn back into the benefits system in the short term – was cut out of Corbyn’s speech and revealed on Saturday instead.The policies are as numerous as they are wide-ranging. The aim of a four-day week, a state-owned drugs manufacturer, higher tax for free social care, the reversal of many legal aid cuts, a potential net-zero carbon target of 2030 and free prescriptions are among them. These are on top of controversial plans already announced, such as allowing workers to gain a stake in large companies.“Yes, lots of policies aren’t as radical as they sound – universal credit wouldn’t actually be scrapped and nor will private schools – but it would be odd not to describe this as a radical programme,” said Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation thinktank. Although Labour has said it will “scrap” universal credit, it will not drop all aspects of the payment. Similarly, the private schools motion will be watered down.Bell added: “Most importantly this programme is radical by volume of what is meant to be attempted in a short time. In practice serious prioritisation would be needed.”The next key moment is the party’s so-called clause V meeting, held to decide which policies end up in a manifesto. Motions passed by the grassroots to seize the assets of private schools and extend free movement will be jettisoned. Huge questions remain as to how the various programmes will be funded, but senior Corbyn allies believe it will be enough to turn an election that was meant to be all about Brexit into a wider conversation about public services. So what were the most significant policies unveiled in Brighton?The conference voted for a motion to “maintain and extend free movement rights” for EU citizens – despite the role immigration played in the referendum campaign. It also told the party to “reject any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number capstargets”. It contradicted Labour’s previous manifesto commitment that “freedom of movement will end”.What’s the reality? There is no question that the Labour leadership is open to looser immigration rules, but Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has been clear that the party backs a work visa scheme. That would not allow free movement to continue.Radical rating ★★★☆☆Ripping up immigration rules is radical and Labour will take a liberal approach, but whoever comes to power will have to introduce a completely new system after Brexit.The surprise announcement in Corbyn’s conference speech was a plan to create a state-owned drugs company capable of making cheap versions of medicines that are too expensive for the NHS. Such a reform would be likely to require patents to be bypassed. It is a big step and an attempt to curb what Labour regards as profiteering by Big Pharma.What’s the reality? A big measure. The pharmaceuticals industry is warning that it will undermine research by discouraging investment in new drugs, and puts smaller companies at particular risk. However, Labour says its plan is similar to policies already used in other countries.This was a new and surprise move from Labour that would take the state into a new arena.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, announced the most radical measure of the Labour conference – a pledge to move to a 32-hour week “within the next decade”, with no loss of pay.What’s the reality? The details of the policy are rather different to the headline. Businesses will not have a four-day week imposed on them. Instead, Labour will use a series of smaller measures to work towards a reduction in hours.A new commission will recommend increases in holiday entitlement to push down average working times. Meanwhile, the really radical element is the introduction of sector-by-sector collective bargaining with unions.It is far from a top-down plan to slash the working week, but there is real radicalism in this measure because of the hugely enhanced role for trade unionism that it implies. The party has not spelled out how that would work in practice.Labour committed to bringing in free personal care for the over-65s in England as a way of easing the social care crisis – at an estimated cost of £6bn. Labour also backs a cap on lifetime care costs. The move will be funded out of general taxation.What’s the reality? It is a big and expensive policy, but reaction to it has been lukewarm from experts in the sector. There are two main concerns. The first is that social care is in such a state that the priority should be stabilising the current system through the expansion of services and retention of staff. The second is that the plan does not cover all care costs such as accommodation, meaning anyone risks being exposed to huge costs if they require serious care.There is big money involved, but Labour will need to spell out the details of its cap on costs and its funding plans.The conference passed a motion calling for the assets of private schools to be redistributed “democratically and fairly across the country’s educational institutions”. The motion, which was driven by the party’s grassroots, was denounced by critics for creating a dangerous precedent of the state seizing private assets.What’s the reality? For all the coverage, it was immediately clear that the plans to seize the assets of the private school sector were not supported by the Labour leadership, which is currently promising to end tax reliefs and other state aid. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has signalled that the party wants to go further over time. Meanwhile, her vow to abolish Ofsted is a major change, as is the idea for a National Education Service, which the party has not yet fully sketched out.Labour will not seize private school assets, but its education policies represent a major break and private education looks set to face a serious challenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8ae0249001a29a4bd55da7f7344f1dcde8365a/1904_774_3141_1884/master/3141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9634deefd215887781979ed8cff18fb","title":"margaret hodge to face reselection after local labour party vote","story":"Vocal critic of Labour’s handling of antisemitism has been MP for Barking since 1994Dame Margaret Hodge, a veteran Labour MP and prominent critic of Jeremy Corbyn, has been triggered for reselection contest by her local constituency party.Hodge has served as MP for Barking in east London since 1994.In a statement to the Huffington Post, Hodge said: “I am obviously disappointed. My priority remains serving the people of Barking as I have done for the last 25 years. At a vital time for the country, with a general election looming, we should be focusing our efforts on holding Boris Johnson and the Tories to account.“I will work to secure the full backing of Barking Labour party, so I can continue to play my part as their MP in doing that.”Under reformed Labour rules, a selection contest can be triggered if a third of local Labour branches vote in favour.Hodge, who has led criticisms of the party’s handling of antisemitism among members, saw off the threat of the British National party in the 2010 general election and, in the same year, she became the first woman to be elected chair of the public accounts committee.Mike Katz, the national chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said: “Margaret Hodge has been a steadfast campaigner against racism, fascism and intolerance throughout her political life.“She saw off the BNP in Barking and has over the last few years been determined in her opposition to antisemitism within the Labour party. This is a shameful moment for a party which claims to embody the values of equality and ersity.“She has been the target of vicious smears, derision and antisemitism, because she has been resolute in her opposition to anti-Jewish racism.”Earlier this month, Diana Johnson vowed to challenge Labour party rules that have led to her facing a reselection battle before the next general election.At a meeting in Westminster she told senior party figures she would fight the “trigger ballot” process after local activists voted to try to find a new candidate for the Hull North seat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc9774eaf9a6cd08d18427f52509183bc6841d4b/0_115_4950_2970/master/4950.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a2c9c6d2dbf6b8207ddf08911b4666e","title":"speaker john bercow summons party leaders to peace talks","story":"Meeting called after multiple MPs raise fears over effect of angry rhetoric in Commons Commons Speaker John Bercow has summoned party leaders to an emergency meeting on the growing use of inflammatory language in Westminster, amid concerns that MPs are facing an increasing safety risk before a potential election.Bercow has convened the meeting on Monday in an attempt to tackle the acrimony in the Commons and to discuss any new security measures in parliament. It comes just days after Boris Johnson accused his opponents of Brexit betrayal and surrender.A number of MPs, including former Tory minister Amber Rudd, have accused Johnson of legitimising violence against opponents with his Brexit rhetoric. He caused outrage last week after refusing to drop the term “surrender act” to describe legal measures designed to stop a no-deal Brexit.However, it is understood that the prime minister will not attend the Speaker’s meeting, instead sticking to his commitments at the Conservative party conference in Manchester. The government plans to send another minister in his place.Johnson ignited the row last week after dismissing the concerns of a Labour MP who had received death threats. Paula Sherriff referred to Jo Cox, the Labour MP murdered in 2016, as she pleaded with the prime minister to refrain from using words such as “surrender”. He dismissed her concerns as “humbug”.It has emerged that West Yorkshire Police are investigating three serious threats against Sherriff in the wake of her heated exchange with Johnson last Wednesday. Sherriff, MP for Dewsbury, told the Observer that following the confrontation her office received hundreds of abusive messages in less than two days. “People are parroting his words in the emails we are getting: you voted for the surrender act, capitulation. People are so angry and the fact that we have a prime minister who is deliberately stoking up this toxic atmosphere is beyond irresponsible,” she said.Tracy Brabin, the neighbouring Labour MP for Batley and Spen, the constituency where Cox was murdered by a far-right terrorist in 2016 days before the EU referendum, said her office had received a fourfold increase in abusive messages since she also told Johnson to “moderate his language” last week.Tensions will be further inflamed after it emerged that Johnson’s key adviser said the term “surrender” would be used repeatedly throughout any election campaign. Dominic Cummings told a meeting on Friday he planned to “ram it down their throats”.It came as police in Gwent investigated comments by Nigel Farage in which he said the Brexit party would “take the knife” to the civil service, condemning “overpaid pen pushers … not doing a neutral job”.Writing in the Observer, Kim Leadbeater, Cox’s sister, calls for party leaders to agree a new standard of conduct.“We cannot go on like this,” she writes. “The poison and intolerance that has infected our national political debate has to be excised. If we cannot find a way to restore some respect and responsibility to our politics the implications will be serious, not just for those in and around Westminster, but for all of us.”Jeremy Corbyn, Jo Swinson and other party leaders are expecting to attend the meeting with the Speaker. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru Westminster leader, said: “It is deeply depressing that it has come to this. Politicians on all sides of the ide have to raise the tone of debate. There is, however, a difference between passionate debate and the cynical use of focus-group tested phrases to whip up anger and ision.“Brexit has released a deeply dark side of our politics, elements of which have found its way into No 10 Downing Street. I hope this meeting will give politicians from all parties, and particularly the prime minister, the opportunity to think again.”Antoinette Sandbach, MP for Eddisbury, one of the 21 who recently had the Tory whip removed for voting against the government, wrote in the Observer the government’s cavalier approach to language was destroying British values and called on moderate Tories to speak out against this “aberration from our values”. Johnson, she added, needed “to recognise he was no longer a highly paid columnist” but the prime minister whose words were taken seriously: “Until he lives up to the reality of his actions, he lets down our country and puts his colleagues in danger.”Brabin has been advised by West Yorkshire Police to have a police presence in her constituency surgery in the wake of threats after the clash with the prime minister. She said: “I would say to anybody reading this article, say ‘well done’ to your MP because it’s going to be too late when they’re in A\u0026ampE. Do it now.”The Labour MP also revealed that even before the latest outbreak of abuse the issue was serious. A summer intern, who was also a friend of Cox, had the role of supervising Brabin’s social media account but found the abuse too much. “He was finding it impacting on his mental health so in the end I took him off the job.”Sherriff also revealed that a number of Tory MPs had approached her to offer support and some said they were making complaints to the party whip over Johnson’s conduct. One told her that he was “mortified” by Johnson’s conduct and last Thursday told Sherriff: “There are so many of us with you and we are making representations to the chief whip.”Sherriff also claimed that a cabinet minister told her that he would personally “sort this out” with Johnson and had already texted the prime minister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ced0d07463d8ef8b436e33bcc5eccf18dfa32dc6/0_29_1560_936/master/1560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bdd0e1bd122f940085ceeeb25a2ae9f","title":"tories hold 12 point lead over labour in latest poll","story":"Jeremy Corbyn’s party trails Conservatives as Lib Dems make gains among remainersThe Conservatives head into their annual conference in Manchester with a 12-point lead over Labour, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer.Adam Drummond, head of political polling at Opinium, said: “Labour’s rough start to their conference doesn’t seem to have affected their position in our poll but their updated Brexit policy may have done.

It’s hidden away but still Mum has found it. I take her by the arm. “It’s OK. We can get out the other way,” I say, leading her inside, through the chintzy cafe where no money is exchanged, to the lift. I bleep my electronic visitor’s pass. The doors to the outside world open for us. Mum walks through them, asking no questions, and admires the flowerbeds.Even though she cannot remember what happened 10 minutes ago or when she last ate, even though this once immaculate lady, left to herself, would head for the street in a petticoat and one earring (“But it doesn’t matter, does it,” she said when I mentioned it), in spite of the holes in her mind that dementia has torn, the desire to go out appears hardwired. She found that gate, and then she remembered where she had found it.Earlier I watched as Jean, Mum’s neighbour in the dementia home, walked up and down the corridor between her room and the communal area, tall and thin in her plaid skirt and jumper, the usual copy of the Times under her arm and anxiety on her face. Up and down. Back and forth. “Has my mother come?” she asks the carers. “No, I’m afraid your family aren’t visiting today,” is the answer. Her mother died years ago. They sit her down, suggest television or a game, and she is instantly on her feet, asking the same question again.Then there were the parcels. I drove her home one day, to find a large brown box outside the door. “Oh no,” she said, in genuine distress. “Not another one.” It contained what she and I would both have called quack remedies for ageing: potions and pills, and a Christmas cracker trinket of a bracelet. Inside was an invoice, paid on her credit card, for over £100. She had not ordered or paid for it, she insisted. And there were others. She had a cupboard full of expensive soaps and knick-knacks – a “sound amplifier” for £30 (there is nothing wrong with her hearing), a “cabbage detox” for £20. It had all been sent by two companies at the same address in France. I was livid. How dare they take advantage of her? But I now think she started it, sending off magazine coupons for hand lotion, though I know they got her to order more junk thereafter.It’s odd how the signals are there, but you don’t see them. The flat smelling of burnt toast. I bought a new toaster. Her empty purse when she went out for coffee with friends. They paid. Her frequent trips in person to the bank. It didn’t occur to me that she no longer knew her pin number. The huge bills she was running up for newspaper delivery. The shopkeeper kindly said nothing. The frightening times I called in the evening, when it was dark, and there was no reply. Finally she would answer, out of breath. She had taken the wrong bus. One time she said a nice man had driven her home.Eventually my sisters and I understood she was no longer safe alone. She resisted any suggestion that she had a problem. “I haven’t got that dementia,” she told me, sternly. But she agreed her memory was playing up. I used that to trick her into a GP appointment and referral to the memory clinic, where she was diagnosed, although no help was offered. We bullied her into twice-daily visits from a carer, who would sometimes arrive to find Mum missing. At Christmas at our house, she caught a virus and ended up in hospital, wandering the corridors at night. Staff refused to let her home without full-time care.Mum hated losing her independence, the same way she had fought us when we “borrowed” her car a couple of years earlier and did not return it. I asked the carers to let her go – but follow her. At the home, where we moved her a year later because of her night wandering, and to be closer to my sisters, only the corridor and patio garden are open to her. She is not deceived, though she can no longer tell you what’s wrong. She is a “sundowner”: after tea, she will walk and walk, up and down the corridor. The challenges of caring for people like her in the way she would want, if she were able to explain it, are great.There may be another answer. In a suburb of Amsterdam, Jannette Spiering sits at a cafe table in the sunshine, while women like Mum and Jean wander past. Spiering is the founder of the Hogeweyk, a dementia village whose fame has travelled the world. She used to help run a conventional care home on the site, which was torn down, and believed she could do better.“We can try to come as close to normality as possible within the restrictions people with dementia have,” she explains. “These are mostly that they can’t make their own daily structure, and they don’t know when to eat, how to cook, how to dress, how to communicate. If they choose to go outside on a day like this, that’s not for us to decide. That’s why the front door of every house is open. We have to take care, if it’s cold, that people put a jacket on and that their shoelaces are tied so they won’t fall over them.“Of course when people move in, they want to leave. I think I would, too, if I were locked up. But what I think is so lovely is you can go outside without someone watching or walking with you.”This is not a village in the traditional English sense. The houses, restaurant and a small theatre form the Hogeweyk’s perimeter wall. Look up and you see it is sandwiched between blocks of social housing flats. But there is space and sky. There are little gardens and a pond with statues of herons – and a real one that takes off as I walk by. The 23 houses, each for six or seven people, are different and separate, but joined as they might be on a terraced street. Outside are shady courtyards with wooden tables and chairs, flower tubs and trees.The Boulevard looks like a town street, but behind the shop fronts are clubs. There’s the Mozart room, where classical music lovers meet. There’s a painting and baking club, which Mum would enjoy, along with any sort of singing. She croons with Frank Sinatra and bops gently to Rock Around The Clock, given the chance. At the Hogeweyk, families sign up their relatives for the clubs that will suit them, though too many activities can exhaust people, Spiering says.In the square, cafe tables are set beside a fountain. Off it is an arcade, with a waiter-service restaurant and a supermarket where the carers shop for each house. If residents wander out with a packet of cereal or a bottle of juice, it can be returned or paid for later. And there is a pub: there is no reason why people with dementia shouldn’t enjoy a drink, although one daughter was scandalised that her non-drinking mother developed something of an advocaat habit. “She blamed us, but her mother just liked going there, attracted by the music or whatever,” Spiering says. People can change for better or worse some start to use bad language inhibitions disappear.The Hogeweyk has its wanderers. A woman with Jean’s tense face walks the village paths stiffly and finally passes through sliding doors into the reception area, ignoring the notice that says “Sorry, we’re closed”. Behind their glass screen, the staff watch. She gets halfway to the double doors on to the street, which will not open unless the receptionists press their button, stops abruptly as if she has remembered something, turns around and walks back into the village. One of more than 100 unpaid volunteers intercepts and takes her for a coffee, to distract her. “There is still some part of her mind that recognises this is not her home and she can’t accept it. I think it is very sad,” Spiering says. Some residents walk all day long, so there are distractions to encourage rest: a large TV screen with seats in the arcade, and cafe staff instructed to invite wanderers in for a drink.There is an element of the gilded cage of the 60s TV series The Prisoner, or The Truman Show, but while residents can’t get out, the outside world is invited in. Young mothers and toddlers meet here weekly. Locals use the restaurant and go to the theatre.The Hogeweyk is not for the mildly ill. Everyone here has late-stage dementia. The average stay is 2.2 years, but some people die within a few weeks. Only three out of 169 residents are in bed all day, Spiering says, and these three are not segregated. “We put them in the living room with their bed, because they can still smell and hear what is going on and be part of it.” There is no sign of the agitation or aggression that often signals distress in people with dementia, no howls of anguish through an upstairs window.Such segregation has its critics, but Spiering argues it is just what we all do for ourselves. We buy into certain lifestyles, or move to be part of a community we feel comfortable in. It doesn’t mean people won’t mix at the bingo group.There may be an element of fantasy, but it is no more than in more traditional dementia homes – such as my mother’s, where people like Jean walk an endless loop of corridors decorated to look like a high street, with Singer sewing machines in alcoves and pictures of the Coronation to recall an epoch that is more vivid in the brain than the recent past. Reality is a tricky concept when it comes to dementia care, as Spiering points out. Some people want to go home, or wait for a visit from their long-dead partner. “We try to distract people, or we go along with them. We say, ‘Is it OK if we go for lunch first?’ You can say it’s a lie or you can say it’s not telling the whole truth.”Dementia used to be dismissed as normal memory loss, a side-effect of ageing. People tended to die of other causes, much younger, so it was less understood. When German psychiatrists Alois Alzheimer and Emil Kraepelin classified it as a disease in the early 20th century, they focused on younger patients. The deterioration of the brain in old age was still regarded as an inevitability.But by the mid-50s, US hospitals began to be overwhelmed by elderly dementia patients. Psychiatrists started to frame it as a psychosocial problem, finding that people from some backgrounds, with the same brain changes, did better than others. There were calls for programmes of activities to keep ageing minds stimulated. After Medicare, the US healthcare programme for the over-65s, was founded, people started to live even longer lives – and dementia soared. By 1980, everybody had heard of Alzheimer’s disease. Funds have been poured into research, mostly to find a pill to reverse it, without success.Patients like my mum, who get a diagnosis, are prescribed a single drug, supposed to help slow the disease, and sent home. There is nothing more the NHS can do, or afford. Age UK and Alzheimer’s charities offer helpful advice, but you have to seek it out.A third of people with dementia are in care homes, which seek to calm and stimulate residents whose memory of the recent past goes first. The walls are lined with photographs of Charlie Chaplin, Ava Gardner, the Queen as a girl. There are wartime singalongs. Living in the past is fine, as are white lies. We take Mum out for ice-cream and cakes at a garden centre, where last time she was overcome by the beauty of the flowers. “I can’t believe it,” she kept saying. We stay in the present moment and talk about the mackerel sky and the planes she thinks are birds. We never talk about dementia.The truth used to be served up cold. “Reality orientation” was developed in the late 50s, on the basis that exercising the memory would keep it functioning better for longer. Patients were trained to know the name of the place they were in, what month it was, who the prime minister was – but it was confrontational and insensitive. If people knew that it was Thursday and that they were widowed, it didn’t make them happier.Instead the focus moved to cognitive stimulation – gentle activities to keep the brain going, such as word games, puzzles, music, and practical activities such as baking or indoor gardening. A Cochrane medical review in 2012 found that 45-minute sessions at least twice a week helped people with mild to moderate dementia. There was some evidence that people were better able to reason, communicate and interact with others, and had a better quality of life. Such activities are now standard in dementia homes and day centres, along with dancing and gentle exercise and singing, all of which Mum loves. And how else would she spend her time?There are other theories. Penny Garner in Oxfordshire, whose mother had dementia, devised Specal (originally an acronym for specialised early care for Alzheimer’s) to help families and carers communicate with a relative who has dementia. At the heart of this is the photograph album – the concept that people have memories stored like photographs, recording feelings as well as facts, and that when the facts disappear, the feelings remain.Garner considers dementia a disability and has three golden rules: don’t ask questions that will only cause distress when the person cannot find the answer listen to the person with dementia and offer them only information that will make them feel better and do not contradict. Her son-in-law, the psychologist Oliver James, wrote a book about the method, called Contented Dementia, and many of its adherents are enthusiastic. But the Alzheimer’s Society is outright opposed, arguing that not asking questions deprives people of choice and control over their lives.The society is not enthusiastic about the idea of dementia villages, either. Dominic Carter, its senior policy officer, agrees that people have to be understood, offered activities and encouraged to eat and drink, but thinks it is “a shame if we are willing to accept that the only way to do that is to segregate people and have them in environments that are so specifically focused”.Instead the society wants to normalise dementia, with a flagship programme to accredit “dementia-friendly communities” – ordinary towns where the baker and hairdresser have been taught how to talk to people with dementia, and where local residents and bus drivers will be better able to see them safely home. So far, it has registered 400 communities, from Minehead to Billericay and beyond. Local Alzheimer’s groups enlist shops, GP practices, libraries, churches, fire, police and social groups, whose members undertake training. There are also activities. Over one week in May, in Tamworth in the west Midlands, there was singing in the shopping centre and community knitting of forget-me-nots to aid the society’s dementia campaign, which includes a call for a £2.4bn government fund to help people with care costs.People with mild dementia will be safer and happier in a town that has more understanding, although the chances of getting lost in a city like Leeds must still be high. But as the disease progresses, the need for full-time care grows. While we might dream of Grandma sitting in a corner of the family home, watching life going on, being looked after by her children, that’s a fantasy, says Professor June Andrews, former director of Stirling’s Dementia Services Development Centre in Scotland.“It’s never been families taking care of their own,” she says. “It’s been women. The extent to which it happens is related to the economic value of women.” In countries where women are uneducated and unemployed, they do the caring, she says. “As soon as the daughter or daughter-in-law can get a job, they start importing a foreign domestic worker.” And once those salaries rise out of reach, care homes spring up.Andrews is sceptical of the Hogeweyk’s “lifestyles” approach but says her own parents – a bus driver and a secretary – would never have been comfortable in a posh care home. “Having something that fits with what somebody is comfortable with is really important,” she admits. But how would you categorise people in the UK, or find the volunteers the Hogeweyk relies on? “The bottom line is, who is going to be able to afford your model if it can only work with an army of volunteers? In the UK, hundreds of care homes are having to shut down because their buildings are not the right quality and they can’t get the right staff.”But New Zealand and Australia have similar villages, and the first to be modelled directly on the Hogeweyk is likely to open in the UK later this year, in east Kent. Henry Quinn and Dr Phil Brighton, from East Kent Hospitals Foundation NHS Trust, tell me they were profoundly moved when they visited the Hogeweyk in 2015. “What struck me most was when they said, ‘The most important things are the front doors.’ If you have a front door and it’s raining, you can go out and get wet,” Brighton says.Quinn went up on to the roof of Buckland hospital in Dover and spotted six semi-detached blocks of derelict houses. They got funding from Europe and are on track to open soon.“It’s a gated community,” Brighton explains. “There will be a boundary fence but not obtrusive or oppressive.” There will be a hub where locals and residents with dementia can go for entertainment, as well as a cafe and a gym. The houses will have five bedrooms each and no locked doors. The team are exploring ideas with the local community, including keeping goats and forging links with a primary school, bringing children in for activities.If we let them, people with dementia take buses to the end of the line. One man, used to global travel, evaded his carer, travelled to the airport and hopped on a plane to the country where he grew up. People in residential homes used to be restrained, tied to chairs. That doesn’t happen any more. In the dementia-friendly communities the Alzheimer’s Society promotes, technology might allow more wandering. There are already GPS devices, informing relatives of people’s whereabouts – whether they want it or not.And that is the hardest part: knowing what someone wants. We make decisions for those with dementia in the hope of protecting them. Sometimes, when you hear of a woman, such as a friend’s mother, rocking in her seat, whispering, “Help me, help me”, you have to wonder if we have got it right.My mum hates locked doors. When she lived in her flat, there wasn’t a day when she didn’t potter to the local shop or get the bus to town. It saddens me to see her wanderings reduced to a corridor and now, even though she is in a safe place with wonderful carers, she is starting to fall last time I visited, I found her with bruises in another resident’s room, as she frequently is. And for the first time, I did not get the sense that she knew who I was. For Spiering, caring for people with dementia is all about calculated risk – “accepting frailty and that, in nursing homes, people are going to have falls, and are going to die, and we can’t prevent that. But we can add quality of life. And it’s not by locking them up and not seeing them as human any more.”My mother is well looked after, by people who see her as human and lovable – but I am disturbed by her constant desire to leave. I want her to be safe, but even more than that, I don’t want her to be unhappy. Most of all, I want her to live the life she wants, in the little time she has left. And it hurts that she can’t tell me – even if she knows – what that is.• All the people photographed and interviewed either live or spend time at villages run by Belong, a charitable UK organisation that provides care, housing and support for people with dementia.If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf7b6d01e166393969d215c8d0fe511064fb9112/375_673_2755_1653/master/2755.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fe161e53f63eb7116c392485a184192","title":"annemiek van vleuten womens road race world championship","story":"• Dutch rider storms clear in Yorkshire to take world crown• Van der Breggen finishes second, Deignan comes home 31stA speculative long-range attack morphed into an epic 105km escape and gave Annemiek van Vleuten the gold medal in the women’s elite race here by a margin of more than two minutes, compensating for her poor luck in the Olympic road race in Rio in 2016. Van Vleuten’s victory looked assured around 40 kilometres from the finish and the final circuit in Harrogate turned into an assured, if painful, lap of honour. In a triumph for the Dutch squad, the defending champion Anna van der Breggen took the silver medal 2min 15sec behind, with the main peloton finishing over five minutes back.Now 36, Van Vleuten has been one of the most prolific winners in women’s racing, with her biggest victories coming in the 2017 and 2018 world time trial championships, La Course by Le Tour de France in both those years, and the Giro Rosa in both 2018 and 2019. The big gap in her CV, however, was one of the major one-day championships she had looked set fair for victory on the tough road race course in Rio in 2016 only to crash at high speed on the descent from the Vista Chinesa climb, ending up with spinal fractures and concussion.“I really enjoyed doing a crazy thing today,” said Van Vleuten, who enjoyed a completely different experience compared to Tuesday, when the hat-trick in the world time trial title eluded her. It came 12 months after another battle against pain – with a completely different result – when she crashed in the world championship at Innsbruck, on a course which suited her climbing talent to perfection, and finished the race with a broken knee having supported Van der Breggen.The marathon race of almost 100 miles through Lizzie Deignan’s home dales ended in disappointment for the 2015 world champion, who led the peloton through her home town of Otley, then forced the decisive split behind Van Vleuten and figured strongly in the chase group for 60 kilometres before fading as the chasers sparred for silver behind the flying Dutchwoman. Deignan eventually finished 31st.Behind, the leaders split, with eight riders forging ahead as Deignan accelerated time after time, clearly aware that her London 2012 rival Marianne Vos was not at the front, and keen to eliminate a key rival. With Deignan went the defending world champion Van der Breggen, Italians Elisa Longo Borghini and Soraya Paladin, Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig of Denmark, the German Clara Koppenburg, the 2018 silver medallist Amanda Spratt of Australia, Tuesday’s world time trial champion Chloé Dygert Owen and the South African Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio.There were still well over 100km to race, which under normal circumstances would be too far for a breakaway of this kind to succeed in a world championship, but as the kilometres passed the chasers diminished in strength. As they sped through the lanes around Ripon, the octet had held Van Vleuten to a margin of less than a minute for over 50km, and could still reasonably hope to have pulled her back if they cooperated. Yet Deignan decided to try to strike out alone, putting in more searing attacks which might have put her in a position to chase solo, but instead caused the chasers decisively to lose momentum.“I’m happy physically with my performance but tactically it was a masterclass in how to get it wrong,” conceded Deignan, who missed a strong attack from Dygert Owen as the race passed through the finish for the first of three laps of the circuit in Harrogate. “The group I was with was racing for silver so I’m pleased I never gave up, but Annemiek was in a class of her own. But it’s been phenomenal to have this opportunity to ride this race at home, and it will be a race I will never forget.”Deignan had no answer as Van der Breggen, Dygert Owen and Spratt engaged in an extended battle for the silver medal, which eventually went the way of the defending champion. But in truth, the destiny of the gold medal had been decided high up on the moors two hours earlier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b61be7382273928e30da54c548e95393b445b0/0_33_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bf82afbd4c6630ad4265e62966753a0","title":"christian coleman mens 100m gold world athletics championships","story":"The king is dead. Long live the king. Athletics has been searching for the undisputed fastest man in the world since Usain Bolt’s retirement in 2017. And in Christian Coleman, who powered to a stunning 100m world title in 9.76, a personal best and the sixth fastest time in history, it undoubtedly has found its man.Some - like the legendary Michael Johnson - believe the missed drugs tests that nearly derailed the 23-year-old American’s career last month must prevent him becoming the face of his sport. But it is too late for that. For better or worse, that is what the softly spoken athlete undoubtedly is.The eye test told you that Coleman had the race won at 30 metres, when he established clear blue water over his competition that he never relinquished. The reality was that everyone knew that it was in the bag during Friday heats and the semi-final earlier , where he was the only man to go under 10 seconds despite trotting over the line. He started the final as a prohibitive favourite. And then he emphatically delivered.Not everyone was delighted with the result given Coleman escaped a potential ban after a missed test and two filing failures - something that it later turned out was within rules that even the US Anti-Doping Agency didn’t fully understand. But afterwards the American insisted he was looking forward. ‚“It’s behind me,” he said. “Sad that someone would try to skew my reputation. I don’t know how the information got out there to the public but it shouldn’t have.“It is what it is, but I’ll just keep doing what I’ve been doing and focus on me. Now I’m a world champion and that’s something that nobody can ever take away from me.”The former champion Justin Gatlin, who has a past of his own, ran faster than any 37-year-old in history, to win silver in 9.89. “I’ve had an up and down season with a couple of injuries,” said a delighted Gatlin. “I had a question mark over my head over whether I’d even make the championships after an injury in Zagreb.”Meanwhile the Canadian Andre De Grasse was third in 9.90. However Britain’s Zharnel Hughes, who had been talked up as an outside medal prospect, was a disappointing sixth in 10.03 sec.“My body wasn’t feeling up for it unfortunately,” admitted Hughes. “When I pushed out I was all over the place and I lost my form. I’m not happy with that, but I live to fight another day.”This was the first major championships without Bolt since 2005. For nearly a decade the 6ft 5in Jamaican was track and field’s biggest star - and its greatest crutch. There has been much talk ever since on the need to jazz up the sport. Certainly the IAAF, athletics governing body, got this final right.Moments before the 100m took place the lights across the Khalifa International went dark and the track lit up. Disco music began to play, and the athletes’ nerves to skip in time. After the spotlight had focused on each athlete, the lights went back up and the sprinters were called to their blocks. But then Coleman blasted out of the blocks, and brutally knocked out the competition.However the undoubted race of the night came in the women’s 10,000m as the Dutch athlete Sifan Hassan slowly reeled in a pack of Kenyan and Ethiopian athletes before sprinting clear of Letesenbet Gidey on the final lap to win her first world title in 30.17.63. That time was quick enough. What made it even more incredible was that the 26-year-old Hassan ran the final 1500m of the race in under four minutes.The biggest shock, meanwhile, came in the men’s long jump as the Jamaican Tajay Gayle recorded the 10th longest leap in history - and broke his personal best by 37cm to win gold in 8.69m, well clear of Jeff Henderson, who took silver, and Juan Miguel Echevarria, who won bronze."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dcf8a8c72f80c6240cddc560afce2d04b9d3866/137_95_3185_1912/master/3185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a8d97668d3667df307225ea473747a9","title":"japan ireland rugby world cup","story":"The last time Japan caused a major shock at a Rugby World Cup they made a movie about it. The 2015 Miracle of Brighton was supposed to have been a complete one-off, never to be repeated. Now, suddenly, there is a blockbuster sequel that could generate even more at the box office. For the tournament organisers and everyone else seeking to promote rugby in Asia, this was the stuff of oval-shaped dreams.It will also hopefully transform a few perceptions elsewhere in the world. As anyone who watched this game will know, this was not some opportunist smash-and-grab raid but a richly deserved, fully justified victory over a team who were recently ranked No 1 in the world. Japan are supposed to be unworthy of so-called tier-one status but they have just harpooned one of the biggest whales in the sport.What ripples this result will generate, across the sport and, crucially, beyond. As recently as 2011 Japan were so far down the pecking order that their best result was a draw with Canada. Now they are in with a chance to qualify for the quarter-finals ahead of Ireland and Scotland unless the latter can summon up something special in Tokyo in a fortnight. When the next set of world rankings are released this coming week they will be up to eighth, ahead of Scotland.That, in itself, makes this a historic moment. In some ways the Shizuoka sensation is even more significant than the Springbok surprise, so famously masterminded by Eddie Jones. The received wisdom was that only Jones could have conjured up such an extraordinary outcome, that Jamie Joseph’s current team had an impossible act to follow. Not so. Ireland were beaten fair and square, outplayed by opponents who seemed to have plugged into an alternative energy source.By the end, Ireland were content to kick the ball out and retreat with a losing bonus point. Pragmatic, sure, but hardly what they envisaged when they flew east. Ireland have had plenty of World Cup disappointments but nothing like this. It remains possible they will still top the pool but any semblance of green impregnability has evaporated into the humid Japanese air. There remains a nagging sense Joe Schmidt’s side peaked a year ago and here was further evidence to support the prosecution’s case.This, though, was primarily a Japanese triumph, not some generous Irish gift. Not everyone in Japan is a rugby fan by any means but this is how to attract new admirers. In fan zones and bars across this extraordinary country, the outpouring of joy was something to behold. Respect and honour are everything here and Joseph’s team are suitably full of samurai warrior spirit.Not every host nation is inspired by the extra pressure of a World Cup on home soil. The opposite was true of England in 2015 and, four years on, there was more than a hint of nerves during Japan’s slightly stuttering opening night victory over Russia. There was absolutely nothing tentative, however, about their second-half display in Shizuoka. Once ahead only they looked like seizing the day. Ireland, lauded for their purposeful forward effort against Scotland, were plodding through treacle by the end. No one, on this evidence, will want to play the Brave Blossoms in the last eight.If nothing else it will hopefully be the emotional bullet train that delivers rugby to a whole new audience. Historically, rugby has often been too insular in its outlook, making decisions primarily for the few and not the many. In certain respects that is still the case but Uruguay’s victory over Fiji, Russia’s defiance, the United States’ growing appetite for the sport and now Japan’s glorious uprising have offered a tantalising glimpse of exciting new horizons.The decision to stage the tournament has certainly been more than vindicated. Ticket sales were already healthy but, at this rate, interest levels will disappear off the scale.Perhaps the night’s most striking image was of youthful Japanese fans in the crowd almost beside themselves with open-mouthed excitement. The best sporting events have their unforgettable snapshots and the first World Cup on Asian soil is now guaranteed to leave an indelible impression.Not only the greatest World Cup upset of all time, but the Miracle of Brighton was also the biggest shock in rugby history. Two-time winners South Africa fell to an injury-time try by Karne Hesketh for the rank outsiders to make it Japan 34 South Africa 32. The win effectively secured Eddie Jones, then Japan’s coach, the England job he now holds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65fbb752deb2d16157d1c2fd74017a205c98a841/0_119_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3261d97bdf668e05ad2cb4cc40c2ba7d","title":"wales australia world cup preview","story":"Warren Gatland’s side are favourites against Australia in Tokyo but recent history is not on their sideBernard Foley was quick with a retort when asked why, four years after the Six Nations failed to provide a World Cup semi-finalist for the first time, the prospect of an all-European final with England, Ireland and Wales all confident of making the last four, was far from fanciful. Foley said: “They all have southern hemisphere coaches, don’t they?”The Australia fly-half, the architect of the 2015 victories over England and Wales has been restored to the side for Sunday’smatch against Wales. It will, after Fiji’s defeat to Uruguay, very probably settle the group title. Wales and Ireland had the same coaches in 2015 when they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by South Africa and Argentina, respectively. Australia saw off England, Wales and Scotland – just – while the Springboks overpowered Scotland and New Zealand flattened France. It was put down as a triumph of ball handling over manhandling, brain-vanquishing brawn, but despite the nationalities of the three head coaches, the gap has closed not through imitation but the reinforcement of traditional virtues.The meeting between Australia and Wales will be the first and only test of whether there has been a significant shift in the balance between the hemispheres, with New Zealand and South Africa in the same pool. England do have Argentina to contend with next Saturday, but the Pumas have barely won a Test since overwhelming Ireland, in the 2015 semi-final.“A number of the squads have improved in terms of depth and consistency,” said Foley. “They all have world-class players throughout their 31 and their domestic competitions are set at an extremely high level. It means they play a lot of good football all year round and that can only benefit them when it comes to preparing for a World Cup.”It is an explanation for the rejuvenation of England and Ireland, the two countries to supply European Champions Cup winners in the past four years. But Wales? The Scarlets did make the semi-finals last year and in 2017 became the last winners of the old Pro 12, but the success of the national side under Warren Gatland has largely been despite the record of the country’s four regions rather than because of it.“We are not going to look too far back,” said the Wales captain, Alun Wyn Jones, who breaks Gethin Jenkins’s record of 129 Welsh caps. “‘Gats has said that we now perform when the big games come around. We know we have a big test in front of us and we will not shy away from it.”For all the three grand slams Wales have won in the Gatland era, and the manner they stole the 2013 Six Nations title from England in Cardiff, it will be their defining moment under Gatland, no more than five weeks before he hands over after 12 years in charge. They are expected to win, as Australia’s head coach, Michael Cheika, acknowledged, even if almost in relief. Yet their record against the south’s big three in the World Cup is poor, 10 straight defeats.While Australia have largely struggled since reaching the final four years ago, they tend to dig deep in a World Cup. They have reached three finals, more than anyone else, and one semi-final in the five tournaments in the professional era, their one failure coming when England burst their tyres at the Stade Velodrome in the 2007 quarter-final.They were in no better shape four years ago than now. Cheika, less than a year into the job, turned to experience then and he has done so again. Wales ended a run of 13 consecutive defeats to Australia in Cardiff in November, but matches between them this decade have tended to be tight, often decided by a late score.“We made changes to the backline from the Fiji game because we want to produce different pictures,” said Cheika. “It was not a response to what happened that day but something we thought about from the very start. Wales are a very well-drilled side, but our players know what their jobs are.”Cheika has loosened the reins this year in an attempt to made his side more difficult to read in an age of constant analysis. It did not work against Fiji who revel in chaos, but if there is a reason why it may be premature to anticipate an all-European final, it is that England, Wales and Ireland are not at their most comfortable dealing with the unexpected. Australia will be armed with the element of surprise and they have a turnover specialist in David Pocock. “There is no one style of play that guarantees you victory,” said Cheika. “When I coached Leinster, we played in a very different way to Munster but both teams were successful. I just like my teams to play footy.“When we first came together at the start of the year and started talking about playing a different way, there were a lot of blank looks, especially from the playmakers because they are so used to pre-calling everything. A certain amount of unpredictability is good.”Wales do not see it that way, but they will need to deal with the unexpected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e812485b64f7814310f567fb93c8615bacfe2a7/162_514_3236_1942/master/3236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70f6138180e3d58e03f7cc7302e578db","title":"yorkshire flies its flags for local hero lizzie deignan","story":"Crowds greet cyclist for world championships, but she is denied goldIt was not hard to identify Lizzie Deignan’s granny by the roadside in Otley on Saturday as her granddaughter went for her second world championship on home roads. Marjorie Dunn was the one wearing a yellow T-shirt saying “I’m Lizzie Armitstead’s Grandma – Now Lizzie Deignan”.The last bit was a recent addition, after her granddaughter married fellow cyclist Philip Deignan in 2016. By Yorkshire logic, it seemed daft to fork out for new one just because Lizzie had changed her surname, so she went down to the print shop in town and asked them to update it. “We’re not buying another,” said her husband Ray, himself sporting a Team Armitstead polo shirt he’d been given by BP at the 2012 Olympics, where Deignan won a silver medal.In the end a fairytale victory was not to be: Dutch rider Annemiek van Vleuten crossed the finish line in Harrogate more than five minutes before Deignan, who took 31st place. But that wasn’t for want of support from Otley. Most of the family, including 11 of Deignan’s cousins, watched the race on Saturday from the road outside the house where she grew up and where her parents, Carol and John Armitstead, still live.It can be no coincidence that Welcome to Yorkshire – the tourist board that persuaded the UCI, the world cycling body, to bring the championships to God’s Own County – had routed the race right by their back garden. How could Deignan resist? Yes, she had only given birth to her first child a year ago, but she would surely not miss the chance to follow up her 2015 title with one on roads she has ridden “hundreds, thousands” of times.Grandma was anxious. “It’s such a dangerous sport, road cycling,” she said, holding Ray’s hand tightly as the race helicopters hovered overhead. She wasn’t expecting a wave from her granddaughter: “She will be very focused on the race. I’ve not even rung her this week. I knew her mind would be solely on the world championships.” When the peloton swept past on the 93-mile course, Deignan was tucked tightly in the middle of a bunch, just a hint of a smile behind her sunglasses.It was remarkable to think that a just a year ago she was recovering from labour. She took minimal maternity leave, riding her bike until two days before her daughter Orla arrived, and then got back in the saddle six weeks later, fixated on being in contention at the 2019 world championships in her native Yorkshire.Leaving Otley with the cheers of family and friends ringing in her ears, she hit another wall of support on the Norwood Edge climb, where a contingent from the Otley Cycle Club had gathered. Deignan, an honorary member, last joined a run two weeks before Orla’s birth. “It was the only time we’ve ever been able to keep up with her,” said Justin Dyson.. “I remember at one point she was on my wheel and I was nervous. I was thinking, if I lose concentration it’s just just myself I’m bringing down here.”The 30-year-old may have been the home-crowd darling, but it was the Dutch squad who went in to the race as favourites. They delivered with devastating ease. Van Vleuten, who had a horrific crash during the road race at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was the rider to make an early breakaway with 64 miles to go on the Lofthouse climb. She rode on her own through the sunlit moors and dales of North Yorkshire all the way into Harrogate and across the finish line, followed two minutes later by last year’s world champion, Anna van der Breggen.Deignan accepted her defeat with grace, praising van Vleuten as “head and shoulders above everyone else today”.“I’m proud of the way I raced and the physical shape I got myself in to be here today,” she said. “Nobody knows the work I have put in to be here apart from me and my husband. I’m more motivated than ever and enjoying myself more than ever, so I am happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ad540f9583b69bef01129394bd1e90c70218c09/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ffe4de37c75581e18ef9840bb5b685a","title":"our teachers whooped for avenue q readers pick the 21st centurys best theatre and dance","story":"Following our selection of this century’s best new plays and dance shows, readers give their reactions and suggestions – from Book of Mormon to The Red Shoes‘Best thing I have seen’: Chris135I put off seeing Hamilton until a couple of months ago on the basis it would be over-hyped, preachy, woke and way too much money.

Has a piece of contemporary dance ever had a bigger audience? Many of whom commented on just how moved they were by something they had not been exposed to before.A small but perfect piece of theatre by The Wooster Group, featuring Eric Berryman. This piece had a quiet stillness, spare set and the magnificent voices of Eric Berryman, Jasper McGruder and Philip Moore all coming together perfectly to bring to life the pain and pathos of work songs, spirituals, and toasts recorded in 1964 in Texas’s then-segregated prison farms. It’s a piece of theatre that exemplifies the very special and unique value of live performance.‘Hilarious and poignant’: freewheelingfrankieI loved Graeae Theatre Company’s by turns hilarious and poignant Reasons to Be Cheerful, which did superb justice to most of Ian Dury’s best songs and wove them into a rite-of-passage story that was much more than a contrived excuse for playing them.‘Blew me away’: dude1981The Flick deserves its spot. Blew me away.

The Speech House Hotel is a 17th-century hideaway with 35 bedrooms (some with four-posters) and two restaurants. Forest walking trails start on the doorstep, it’s next to the Cyril Hart Arboretum, and the Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail is close by, with art works hidden among the trees.

It has been a source of literary inspiration for several former guests, not least Daphne du Maurier, who named one of her novels after the place. Later tenants were Maria Pendragon and Clara Vyvyan: the latter describes the cottage in her book The Helford River. “Often, instead of reading, I would sit gazing out of the window at that wall of trees rising to the sky and feeling the quiet of that place as if it were soft music.” The two-bedroom hideaway can be reached by boat at high tide, or by foot along a path.• Sleeps four, from £439 for three nights, landmarktrust.org.ukThe 200-square-mile National Forest is the biggest environment-led regeneration project in the country: by this autumn, 9m trees will have been planted in less than 30 years, on land once scarred by mining and industry.

A Broadway veteran, she is also known for her supporting roles in TV dramas such as True Blood and Rectify. She’s currently playing Gerri Kellman, general counsel to Waystar Royco, on HBOSky Atlantic hit Succession. Smith-Cameron is married to writer-director Kenneth Lonergan and they have a 17-year-old daughter.Your character, Gerri, is proving to be the cult star of season two...I don’t know about that but, if so, it’s delightful. I think it’s because she’s always having those eye-roll moments, looking down her glasses or taking a pointed sip of water, which the audience find satisfying. She’s in the inner circle but slightly removed because she’s not a member of the Roy family. Gerri’s largely unflappable so it’s fun to watch when she does react. And those reaction shots are pretty meme-friendly, as it turns out.Are you getting recognised more as the show has taken off?Definitely. And Succession seems to have very erse fans, which is great. I don’t dress or wear my hair like Gerri, so sometimes at the end of a meal at a restaurant, the waitress will suddenly go: “Wait a minute, aren’t you…?” It’s often a slow dawning.Why do you think season two is so much bigger than season one?Partly because the show very confidently took its time to set itself up. There are lots of layers to it and the style has this sort of cold objectivity. Jesse and the other writers relish the characters’ foibles but don’t glorify them. They show how awful they are but don’t spell things out or over-explain. It’s deftly done and finding that exact delicate tone took time. The audience had to hang in there but when they did crack the puzzle, it was extra-rewarding. Gerri’s relationship with Roman Roy, played by Kieran Culkin, has developed into something sexual. Did you see that coming? It took me by surprise as much as viewers! In season one, when we were shooting scenes in the UK, Kieran and I did a little improv that wasn’t used. They often let us do an extra, looser take or leave the camera rolling at the end of a scene. It was just jokey repartee about mixing martinis because we both, on occasion, order one then we pretended to check each other out as we walked away. I’m not sure it was flirtatious but there was some little frisson between us. Everyone found it funny and that might have informed the subsequent storyline.You and Kieran knew each other already. Did that make the intimate scenes easier?I’ve known Kieran for years. He’s been in several of my husband’s projects and we have lots of mutual friends. It was a great luxury to have that rapport already. We knew each other’s sense of humour.What is it that makes their relationship so fascinating?It’s unexpected and perverse. I guess the shock is part of the fun of it. But there’s also this burgeoning mentor relationship which is very tender. I’d venture to say that’s what interests Gerri more – to be able to influence one of the Roys and form an alliance.And you got to coin the term “slime puppy” …Ha, yes. I think that was my improvisation. I looked back at the script and that certainly wasn’t on the page. We were talking on the phone and as Roman was, shall we say, finishing, we’d run out of dialogue, so I said a few different things. That one made it into the cut. It was their first time and Gerri was sort of disgusted but the more disgusted she sounded, the hotter it was for him.What did you make of your character when you first saw the part?It was originally a male role, Gerry with a Y. When I first auditioned, they’d just decided to call women in to read for it, too. I stumbled across this idea that Gerri was someone who’d wince and give withering glances. I also figured she’d been with the business a long time, so had to be a survivor. Someone who could step around booby traps and perform under pressure.Well, Roman said she’s “a stone-cold, killer bitch”.He’s such a flirt! He says that admiringly because Gerri is quite a badass. She’s a high-stakes player but also relatable because she’s unnerved at times. Sometimes she’s just trying to stay on the surfboard. That makes her interesting.This week’s episode is filmed in Scotland again. How was that?We had a blast. We got to shoot in the new V\u0026ampA in Dundee, which is very cool-looking.In your mind, are the Roy family a take on the Trumps, the Murdochs or someone else?An amalgamation. I think the writers artfully pick and choose qualities they’ve observed from all these families and their power structures. It’s partly about what life is like if you’re super-rich with that much power. But to be a junior family member under someone like that is weirdly powerless – they have the trappings of this great life yet they’re frustrated by their impotence.In Succession, women often seem the smartest ones in the room. Might they eventually take over from the men?That would be interesting. It’s certainly a growing theme: that the men are hotheads, while the women are capable of being more measured. I have no idea in grand terms where the story is going but that’s one possible direction.Which actor is the least like their character?Matthew Macfadyen for sure. Matthew himself is decorous, well-read and charming – but his character Tom is such a doofus.What’s your favourite role in your career so far?Oh gee. Well, I love this one but outside of Succession, I adored Juno and the Paycock in the off-Broadway production. My part in Rectify was fascinating because she was so repressed. And I loved my role in my husband’s movie Margaret, which was incredibly multifaceted – and Kieran Culkin was in it too, which brings us full circle.Your Twitter game is excellent. Is it a chance to show your political side?I suppose so. I was bashful to begin with, then Brexit and our election happened. I felt like everybody suddenly had to become political to some degree. Maybe it was too little too late but it was time to find a voice and connect with people. The global community felt in danger and it felt like social media could be used for good. It’s also fun. There are a lot of witty people on Twitter.What makes you happy when you’re not working?I’m a big bookworm and love to read. I like baseball. I’m currently looking at colleges with my daughter too, which is gratifying.You should dress as Gerri when you visit the colleges.Good idea! I might command some respect.

We’ll find out tomorrow, unless you’re one of those people who stays up for the online spoiler. Personally I prefer the surprise, but whatever floats your Strictly boat – just please don’t give away the result in the comment box. So that’s IT for the dancing – Karim and Amy are at the top of the leaderboard, and James and Luba are at the bottom. The voting is OPEN, so vote vote vote!Scores: 6,6,6,6 - a total of 24 for Will and Janette.Will’s bought his ping pong bat out this week, as is traditional in the Salsa. He definitely gets gold for giving it both barrels and maintaining a slightly constipated facial expression throughout. Bags of attitude, some decent Salsa basics, a bit lacking in the shimmy and hip action but good fun nonetheless. Enjoyed that. And finally, it’s WILL AND JANETTE! This week they’re dancing the Salsa to 1-2-3 by Gloria Estefan. This is solid gold 80s classic, and I’m hoping Will is going to wrap up the night with full wedding dancefloor abandon. If you were doing the Salsa on Strictly, you’d have a drink or two beforehand, surely? I’d have to be at least two G\u0026ampTs deep for any kind of shimmy. Scores: 7,7,7,7 - a total of 28 for Kelvin and Oti.Bruno really felt it, and has finally lost his marbles - for such a big hulk, Kelvin is so light on his feet. Craig thought Kelvin needs to watch his hands out of hold, and his bottom was sticking out. Motsi thought it had a beautiful atmosphere, but Kelvin needs to relax his shoulders. Shirley had issues with Kelvin’s footwork at the beginning, and it wasn’t the best frame of the night, but there’s no disputing Kelvin’s talent. Kelvin’s decided to dance on his own, because who needs Oti? Oh there she is, looking ine as usual. This is delightful, if a little patchy in the footwork occasionally. Still, dry ice is covering up most of it (DRINK). A lovely romantic Waltz, nice work Kelvin. Only two left! Next up it’s KELVIN AND OTI! Tonight they’re dancing the Waltz to ‘What the World Needs Now’ by Burt Bacharach. There’s no question that Kelvin has hips to spare (still pushing my eyeballs back in after last week), so now we need to know if he can deliver style and elegance in ballroom too. If so, Kelvin is going to be the one to watch this season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/157251c3afa50606982b75750195fbc1da6d186d/0_78_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b890167165be50952880ce982aeb8c6","title":"courmayeur you broke our glacier mont blanc resort climate frontline","story":"Reports that a mass of ice is in danger of breaking away have spurred residents of nearby Courmayeur to demand actionby  Angela Giuffrida in CourmayeurLike millions of their compatriots around the globe, the children of Courmayeur marched last Friday to protest against the climate crisis. The group of 160 or so pupils, some as young as six, turned out with banners and slogans, repeatedly shouting: “Ban plastic, save our planet.” But their most prominent placard message showed that for the youngsters of this small Italian resort town at the foot of Mont Blanc, the threat of climate change is particularly close to home. “You broke our glacier”, it read.The activists were referring to Planpincieux, a glacier on the nearby Grandes Jorasses peak that is changing so rapidly that experts warned last week that a huge portion of ice was in danger of breaking away.“We live here and can see the damage that climate change is doing,” said Matteo Pelliciotta, a teacher who helped on the march. “Every day, the glacier changes and becomes more grey in colour. This protest is more than just a message, it is a demand for politicians to take proper action.”They can be assured that at least their mayor, Stefano Miserocchi, is taking the issue seriously. Miserocchi was quick to act last week when experts at the Fondazione Montagna Sicura (Safe Mountain Foundation) in the Aosta Valley said up to 250,000 cubic metres of ice were at risk of sliding off the Planpincieux. The glacier, which has been closely monitored since 2013, is always moving, but the size of a recent fracture and a significant increase in the speed at which the ice is melting raised the alarm. The area is popular with hikers, so as a safety precaution Miserocchi closed mountain refuges and part of a road upon which the ice could directly fall. Contrary to initial reports, only one home had to be evacuated. The other 10 or so in the hamlet beneath the glacier are empty holiday homes. But there is nonetheless deep unease. Can the glacier hold on? For how long?“Each year you see how much the glacier changes,” Miserocchi told the Observer. “The average temperature has risen to the point where, in winter, ice is no longer being recreated because even though it snows, the temperature doesn’t get cold enough. Where there was once ice, there is now rock.”Scientists are unable to predict when the mass of ice might collapse, but Miserocchi is not taking any chances as the glacier’s transformation has already cost lives. In August last year, a heavy storm unleashed a debris flow, killing an elderly couple when their car was swept from the road that is currently closed. Hundreds of people had to be evacuated from their homes. In January, a breakage in the wall of ice caused an avalanche, narrowly missing homes.Safe Mountain Foundation experts are monitoring 184 glaciers in the Aosta Valley region. There are 4,000 glaciers across the Mont Blanc massif, the highest mountain range in Europe, which straddles Italy, France and Switzerland. Scientists predict that if emissions continue to rise at the current rate, the Alpine glaciers would shed half of their ice by 2050.Fabrizio Troilo, a geologist at the foundation, reels off a list of historical disasters caused by collapsing glaciers. In 1965, two million cubic metres of ice and debris fell from the Allalin glacier in the Swiss canton of Valais, killing 88 workers at the Mattmark dam construction site below. Five years later, an earthquake triggered the collapse of an unstable glacier in Peru, burying the town of Yungay and killing more than 20,000 people. In 1892, 200,000 cubic metres of water and ice that had collected in a cavity on the Tête-Rousse glacier in France burst through the ice, triggering a flood that cost 175 lives.More recently, a stream burst its banks in the Swiss resort of Zermatt in July, caused by glacial meltwater .“These are rare events, but all glaciers under certain circumstances can have different behaviours that can be dangerous, not so much for climbers but for people living in the area,” said Troilo.In Aosta alone, the team has recorded a massive loss of ice across the region’s glaciers, he added.“We use all the latest technology … but it’s not easy to detect a lake that forms underneath the surface. For example, in Zermatt there was an outburst even though the glacier was being continuously monitored.”As for the Planpincieux glacier, Troilo said that “everything is under control”, and in the worst-case scenario the ice would fall in the direction of the road and not on the cluster of homes in the area of Val Ferret.Looking towards the glacier from the hamlet below, Rocco Raffaele, the manager responsible for the defence of the territory at Aosta’s regional authority, said news of the potential collapse probably wouldn’t have attracted as much attention had it not emerged during the week of the UN climate action summit in New York. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said the warning that part of Mont Blanc risked collapsing “must shake us all and force us to mobilise”.“But the Alps have been feeling the effects of climate change for a long time,” said Raffaele. “As a glacier disappears, the material extracts beneath it become exposed, and when it rains, like it did in August last year, that material gets deposited down.”In the event of a collapse, it would take less than two minutes for the mass to reach the municipal road.“There is a danger, but that doesn’t mean you have to shut everything down,” said Raffaele. “It simply means being aware and understanding how to be responsible in the mountains.”But, as worried tourists frantically called hotels to inquire if they should cancel their trips to Courmayeur, those running tourism businesses were unhappy that the news had generated so much attention.“This could be really damaging for us,” said Luca Savaglia from the Alpine Guides Society, which organises mountain excursions. “This particular glacier has always moved, and there are no hiking paths there, no climbing … we haven’t had any cancellations, but a lot of people have called to ask what is going on.”Residents were also unhappy that newspapers gave the impression that their town was in danger, while Jean Pierre Fosson, secretary-general of the Safe Mountain Foundation, was left fuming after Greenpeace released an inaccurate statement.“They said the situation was very dangerous in Courmayeur and that lots of homes were evacuated, but Planpincieux is 7km away from Courmayeur,” said Fosson. “We would never say a situation is not serious, but at the same time we have to give the correct information as we don’t want people living here to leave.”But in a week during which millions of children took part in a global climate strike inspired by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, experts are pleased the news has helped draw attention to the vulnerability of glaciers. The children of Courmayeur were among the estimated one million young Italian protesters.Raffaele said that the emotion galvanised by Thunberg now needed to be turned into concrete action. However, while children blame adults for breaking their environment, he advised them to also reflect on their own behaviour.“My 10-year-old daughter keeps telling me to stop doing lots of things, such as keeping the tap running while brushing my teeth,” he said. “But she is the one who leaves the lights on and takes hot showers for 30 minutes. They have an awareness that is superior to ours, but they also need to change their habits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bcf7ddf08efe9bf6fdeabab30dcc128ce973c4/0_382_4576_2746/master/4576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d932f4c15b64a977b7cb5337924adbbb","title":"high fives and cheeky guinness as japan celebrates rugby biggest shock","story":"Delight as host nation’s win over Ireland lights up the World CupIn the end, as ecstatic Japanese rugby fans celebrated their team’s first victory over Ireland on Saturday, it was left to a retired warrior from the losing side to offer a sense of perspective.“This tournament needed a second-tier nation to beat a first-tier nation and this was no fluke,” said the former Irish wing Shane Horgan. “They thoroughly deserved it, out-played Ireland – all of a sudden, this tournament becomes very, very tricky for Ireland.”And very, very interesting for the host nation. The Brave Blossoms’ stunning 19-12 win over a side that ranked world number one just a few weeks ago has electrified the Rugby World Cup, with international stars quick to pay tribute on social media.“What have we just witnessed?” the former Welsh wing Shane Williams asked on Twitter. “One of the performances of the tournament so far!”The England legend Jason Robinson declared: “They’ve only gone and done it again!!!! Huge well done to @JRFURugby.”In Tokyo, as the final whistle blew some 180km away in Shizuoka, fans drank in the magnitude of their team’s performance, a victory that eclipsed the defeat of Fiji by unfancied Uruguay on Wednesday, another shock result that the game’s supporters hope will attract new converts.“I didn’t think we stood any chance of winning before the match,” said Kazuyuki Imano, an IT worker who played rugby at high school. “But we’ve won. That’s all that matters.”Those who recalled the “Brighton miracle”, Japan’s epic victory over South Africa in the last Rugby World Cup, said this weekend’s “Shizuoka shock” surpassed even the heroics of four years ago. Several predicted that the game would reap idends in Japan, if the team were able to build on their historic victory.“This is much bigger,” said Takuya Sato, a longtime rugby fan who faced Japan’s winger Kotaro Matsushima as a high school player. “Once the tournament is over, rugby fever might subside a bit. But if Japan reach the quarter-finals, it will be a huge boost for the sport here.”TV networks flashed the result, while, in bars around Japan’s capital, seasoned rugby fans and recent converts exchanged high fives and hugs, with some cheekily ordering rounds of Guinness to celebrate.Social media sites were overrun with video clips of the match, with some voicing mixed feelings about the result. Oona McGee, a half-Japanese Australian who lives in Tokyo, tweeted: “Joy and sorrow but what a match! Brilliant play by Japan.” The tournament’s official Japan-language account posted a clip of prop Keita Inagaki in tears after the final whistle.Japan failed to reach the knockout stages of the last world cup, despite winning three of their four pool games. But victory over Ireland leaves them within reach of the quarter-finals, with Samoa and Scotland standing in their way.“Japan won because they did the obvious things really well – they just kept running at Ireland right until the end,” said Masaaki Yamashika, who watched the match, appropriately enough, at Craic, an Irish-themed pub. “I think Ireland thought they were going to win this and let their concentration go.”Qualifying from Pool A would, though, raise the possibility of a quarter-final meeting between Japan and the All Blacks – a prospect many home fans wanted to avoid.“We’d much rather play South Africa and repeat what we did to them four years ago,” said Naoto Kamikubo in between gulps of beer on a warm evening in Tokyo.His friend Hidenari Shiromizu said the drama in Shizuoka had truly brought the competition to life for home supporters, just over a week after an error-prone Japan beat Russia in the tournament’s opening fixture.“I was three years old when the first Rugby World Cup was held,” Shiromizu said. “And now it’s here … and this has happened.”Most pundits expected Ireland to prevail over Japan, but Japan’s coach, Jamie Joseph, said his side had gone into the match with only victory in mind. “We’re ecstatic about the result,” the New Zealander said. “We’re really proud of the players, we had a plan. We’ve been training for a long time. We’ve been thinking about this game for quite a long time. Obviously, Ireland have been thinking about it for the last six or seven days.”The Ireland hooker Rory Best, paid tribute to the host nation. “We knew how tough it was going to be. Anyone who is utterly shocked hasn’t seen how good they were. We had a game plan and were prepared, we made a few mistakes and were on the wrong side of the penalty count. But Japan played really well and posed us a lot of questions, unfortunately we couldn’t come up with the right answers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/974a8f0bc102cec21a135d9a1319c9fee929339c/11_20_2386_1432/master/2386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e6c875694a249e19f8b84d184fe03c","title":"ebola response in the democratic republic of congo in pictures","story":"This is the 10th Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

We feel we have served the story and it is time to bow out.”The comments come as Waller Bridge has just signed a £50 million deal with Amazon to work on new shows with the team behind Fleabag.Following the announcement of the deal, which will make the 32-year-old the highest-paid British woman in television, Amazon bosses have been open about their hopes for a swifter return for FleabagSpeaking of the chances of third series emerging during the three-year-deal, Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke said: “I\u0027m a believer — I\u0027ll have to really know that firmly and see evidence of that before I really buy in.

In this case, some further monetary tightening (limited and gradual) is likely to be needed over time.Another scenario, and this is perhaps more likely to me, is of prolonged high Brexit uncertainty (even without a no-deal Brexit actually occurring). In this case, it might well be appropriate to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for an extended period and perhaps to loosen policy at some stage, especially if global growth remains disappointing.WeWork is selling its $60m Gulfstream private jet\u0026nbspWeWork, the troubled office rental firm that bills itself as a revolutionary tech company, appears to be getting a much-needed dose of reality after abandoning its disastrous plans to sell shares to the public.\u0026nbspNow that controversial founder Adam Neumann has been removed as CEO, WeWork is selling off its $60m Gulfstream private jet and has halted all new lease agreements in a bid to stem massive losses.\u0026nbspSome people will be asking why\u0026nbspa start-up that was burning through billions of dollars of funding from private investors was allowed to splash $60m on a plane in the first place.\u0026nbspTwo new chief executives brought in to inject some sanity into the company are reportedly seeking to oust roughly 20 of Neumanns friends, including some senior managers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat next for the pound?\u0026nbspSterling has taken a pummeling this morning in response to comments from a\u0026nbspBank of England policymaker.\u0026nbspBut...\u0026nbspUBS thinks the pound is likely to rise as Brexit political wranglings run their course.\u0026nbspThe latest twist in the Brexit saga was the UK Supreme Court’s decision that the suspension of the UK Parliament, which strongly opposes a no-deal Brexit, was unlawful.\u0026nbspOur base case remains for the UK to ask for an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline instead of leaving the EU without a deal.

See blowSmall firms in \u0027urgent need\u0027 of Brexit support\u0026nbspSmall businesses are in urgent need of more government support to overcome a worrying lack of preparedness for a no-deal Brexit, according to\u0026nbspthe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).\u0026nbspAmong the 39 per cent of small firms that think a no-deal will negatively impact them, only one in five have planned or prepared for anticipated issues. Nearly two thirds don’t think they are able to plan.\u0026nbspBusinesses that have prepared have spent about\u0026nbsp£2,000, according to the FSB\u0027s survey.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThat average cost rises to £3,000 for smaller businesses that export and import.\u0026nbspThe falling pound has helped push up the FTSE 100 which is full of multinationals that generate revenues in other currencies.\u0026nbspThe blue-chip index is up 0.8 per cent to 7,412.52 this morning.\u0026nbspMining shares have done well with Evraz, Glencore and Anglo American all on the rise.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspConsumer confidence up in September\u0026nbspConsumers are feeling a little better than they did last month, suggesting they are keeping their fingers crossed in the run up-to the 31 October Brexit deadline, according to a new poll.\u0026nbspGfK\u0027s long-running index of what shoppers are thinking moved up to (minus) -12 in September from -14 in August, meaning more people are still pessimistic than optimistic.\u0026nbspPeople are very downbeat about the economy but much more positive when it comes to their own personal financial situation, the survey\u0026nbspreveals.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJoe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, says:\u0026nbsp“More mixed signals this month as consumers continue to feel less than positive about the state of their personal finances and the general economy.\u0026nbspYes, all sub measures are higher, but they are anaemic in the case of our purchase intentions and how we view our wallets, while the results on the wider economy are still depressed.\u0026nbspSince the Brexit referendum we have witnessed a long succession of negative Overall Index scores with the overall trend downwards. This month, British consumers appear to be treading water during this wait-and-see run-up to October 31st.\u0026nbspConfidence is an important indicator which typically increases as the economy expands and decreases when the economy contracts and so far, consumer confidence is holding up.\u0026nbspWe certainly have a long way to go to match the record low headline score of -39 witnessed during the early days of the last recession. But will it stay that way? You can almost sense people are keeping their fingers crossed.”Crisis?

But households do not expect broader economic difficulties to affect them confidence about the outlook for their \u0026nbsp personal finances is only fractionally below pre-referendum levels.\u0026nbspHowever, he cautions:\u0026nbspLooking ahead, the slowdown in both employment and wage growth signalled by most surveys suggests consumers’ optimism might begin to fade.\u0026nbspIn addition, we doubt that the forthcoming election will lead to a swift resolution of Brexit uncertainty indeed, the current level of consumers\u0027 confidence points on past form to another hung parliament.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson\u0027s tax cuts will hand billions to higher earners\u0026nbspThe tax cuts promised by Boris Johnson would cost billions and benefit mostly higher earners, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said, proposing a different way to help people on low incomes.Oil giant\u0027s CEO under investigation over Congo dealings\u0026nbspItalian oil and gas group Eni said on Thursday its chief executive, Claudio Descalzi, was under investigation for a conflict of interest issue over dealings in the Congo, Reuters reports\u0026nbspIn a statement Eni said CEO Descalzi had been served notice by prosecutors he was being probed for not disclosing certain information regarding relations between Eni’s Congo unit and a company called Petroservice. It gave no additional details.\u0026nbspA source close to the matter said prosecutors in the Congo probe were alleging Descalzi had not disclosed the fact that his wife, Marie Magdalena Ingoba, was behind Petroservice. Eni declined to comment.“I firmly reject the alleged accusation. It is without any foundation,” Descalzi said in the statement.Natwest app down: Business customers having trouble logging into Bankline\u0026nbspSome NatWest customers are unable to log into the desktop version of the lender\u0027s Bankline app for businesses, the bank has said.\u0026nbspWe’re aware that some customers may be experiencing issues logging in to Bankline.

the dark about what they\u0027re buyingEnergy suppliers that do not generate or directly source green energy risk misleading customers by claiming they are “100 per cent renewable”, according to a report.Suppliers can be seen as “greenwashing” by purchasing certificates from companies that generate renewable electricity, which allow them to claim they provide zero-carbon energy, even though much of the power they actually supply may comes from fossil fuels, Which? has argued.Green Star Energy, Ovo Energy, Pure Planet, Robin Hood Energy, So Energy, Tonik Energy and Yorkshire Energy all sell “100 per cent renewable” electricity tariffs but do not generate any renewable energy themselves or buy any directly.Instead they buy Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) certificates, whose purpose is to prove to the final customer that a given share of energy was produced from renewable sources.The average household uses a little over 3MWh of electricity per year, meaning suppliers can buy the certificates to match this usage for only around £1.55 per customer and claim a tariff is “100 per cent renewable”.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all

doing little to support additional renewable energy supply.However, some suppliers hit back at the criticism. Steven Day, co-founder of Pure Planet, said that any suggestion it misled customers is untrue and that Which?’s report demonstrates a “fundamental misunderstanding of the way electricity is generated, certified, traded, managed by the grid and supplied”.He added: “All green suppliers have to use REGOs to verify that the electricity used by their customers is matched by electricity generated from renewable sources.”Which? analysed more than 300 energy tariffs and found that 40 suppliers sold what they described as 100 per cent renewable options.It said much greater clarity is needed around how “renewable” energy is defined and marketed to ensure customers aren’t misled.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others go a step further and generate renewable electricity themselves or buy it from those that do, rather than relying on REGO certificates.Both Ecotricity and Good Energy source enough renewable electricity to match their customers’ usage, but this tends to mean their costs are higher and therefore their tariffs are more expensive.Recognising that these firms directly support renewable energy, regulator Ofgem exempted both companies from its price cap on standard variable tariffs.Richard Headland at Which? said: “As consumers grow ever-more environmentally-conscious, it’s concerning that some suppliers appear to be ‘greenwashing’ their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers.“We believe there needs to be greater clarity on how renewable electricity is defined and marketed. People can only make informed decisions about where to buy their energy from if firms are more upfront and transparent about their green credentials.”Green Star Energy and Foxglove Energy both said they source all electricity from renewable generators, but Which? said the firms do not own renewable generation or have contracts with renewable generators and buy REGO certificates to match customers\u0027 use.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A protective award is additional redundancy compensation ordered by an employment tribunal if the staff weren’t consulted by their employer before being let go.Although there is no guarantee the claims will be successful, they are “worth bringing”, says Richard Linskell, employment partner at law firm Gunnercooke.“In this case, there’s an argument that the management knew about the insolvency in advance,” he adds.“Whether they knew about it long enough in advance to consult on redundancies is another matter. They were trying very hard to avoid the insolvency but that does not preclude them consulting at the same time.”Simpson Millar gave the example of one ex-employee who found out she had lost her job from a generic email at 1am on Monday morning.“We knew there were difficulties earlier in the year, but they were played down internally,” Claire Hoang from Stalybridge in Manchester was quoted as saying.In other cases, former Thomas Cook workers did not even receive the email and instead learnt of their fate via the news, the law firm said.Ex-employees can claim a protective award only if they were made redundant alongside at least 19 other people at the same place of work. That would exclude people from smaller Thomas Cook stores.The compensation is separate from basic redundancy pay and wages and benefits owed, but both are paid by the government’s Insolvency Service if the employer has gone under. \u0026nbspAccording to the latest figures from the Insolvency Service, 6,002 out of 9,041 Thomas Cook employees in the UK have been made redundant since the firm collapsed on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A Labour government would move towards a 32-hour working week, raise the minimum wage to “at least £10 an hour”, ban zero-hours contracts and give all workers full employment rights from day one of employment, he pledged.He said he believed in “working to live, not living to work”.Eyes will now turn to the Conservative Party conference, which is scheduled to get underway on Sunday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In this case, some further monetary tightening (limited and gradual) is likely to be needed over time.Another scenario, and this is perhaps more likely to me, is of prolonged high Brexit uncertainty (even without a no-deal Brexit actually occurring). In this case, it might well be appropriate to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for an extended period and perhaps to loosen policy at some stage, especially if global growth remains disappointing.WeWork is selling its $60m Gulfstream private jet\u0026nbspWeWork, the troubled office rental firm that bills itself as a revolutionary tech company, appears to be getting a much-needed dose of reality after abandoning its disastrous plans to sell shares to the public.\u0026nbspNow that controversial founder Adam Neumann has been removed as CEO, WeWork is selling off its $60m Gulfstream private jet and has halted all new lease agreements in a bid to stem massive losses.\u0026nbspSome people will be asking why\u0026nbspa start-up that was burning through billions of dollars of funding from private investors was allowed to splash $60m on a plane in the first place.\u0026nbspTwo new chief executives brought in to inject some sanity into the company are reportedly seeking to oust roughly 20 of Neumanns friends, including some senior managers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat next for the pound?\u0026nbspSterling has taken a pummeling this morning in response to comments from a\u0026nbspBank of England policymaker.\u0026nbspBut...\u0026nbspUBS thinks the pound is likely to rise as Brexit political wranglings run their course.\u0026nbspThe latest twist in the Brexit saga was the UK Supreme Court’s decision that the suspension of the UK Parliament, which strongly opposes a no-deal Brexit, was unlawful.\u0026nbspOur base case remains for the UK to ask for an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline instead of leaving the EU without a deal. GBPUSD currently trades at 1.23, well below our purchasing power parity estimate of 1.58.\u0026nbspI should point out this guidance was issued just before Michael Saunders\u0027 latest comments.... See blowSmall firms in \u0027urgent need\u0027 of Brexit support\u0026nbspSmall businesses are in urgent need of more government support to overcome a worrying lack of preparedness for a no-deal Brexit, according to\u0026nbspthe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).\u0026nbspAmong the 39 per cent of small firms that think a no-deal will negatively impact them, only one in five have planned or prepared for anticipated issues. Nearly two thirds don’t think they are able to plan.\u0026nbspBusinesses that have prepared have spent about\u0026nbsp£2,000, according to the FSB\u0027s survey.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThat average cost rises to £3,000 for smaller businesses that export and import.\u0026nbspThe falling pound has helped push up the FTSE 100 which is full of multinationals that generate revenues in other currencies.\u0026nbspThe blue-chip index is up 0.8 per cent to 7,412.52 this morning.\u0026nbspMining shares have done well with Evraz, Glencore and Anglo American all on the rise.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspConsumer confidence up in September\u0026nbspConsumers are feeling a little better than they did last month, suggesting they are keeping their fingers crossed in the run up-to the 31 October Brexit deadline, according to a new poll.\u0026nbspGfK\u0027s long-running index of what shoppers are thinking moved up to (minus) -12 in September from -14 in August, meaning more people are still pessimistic than optimistic.\u0026nbspPeople are very downbeat about the economy but much more positive when it comes to their own personal financial situation, the survey\u0026nbspreveals.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJoe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, says:\u0026nbsp“More mixed signals this month as consumers continue to feel less than positive about the state of their personal finances and the general economy.\u0026nbspYes, all sub measures are higher, but they are anaemic in the case of our purchase intentions and how we view our wallets, while the results on the wider economy are still depressed.\u0026nbspSince the Brexit referendum we have witnessed a long succession of negative Overall Index scores with the overall trend downwards. This month, British consumers appear to be treading water during this wait-and-see run-up to October 31st.\u0026nbspConfidence is an important indicator which typically increases as the economy expands and decreases when the economy contracts and so far, consumer confidence is holding up.\u0026nbspWe certainly have a long way to go to match the record low headline score of -39 witnessed during the early days of the last recession.

It gave no additional details.\u0026nbspA source close to the matter said prosecutors in the Congo probe were alleging Descalzi had not disclosed the fact that his wife, Marie Magdalena Ingoba, was behind Petroservice. Eni declined to comment.“I firmly reject the alleged accusation. It is without any foundation,” Descalzi said in the statement.Natwest app down: Business customers having trouble logging into Bankline\u0026nbspSome NatWest customers are unable to log into the desktop version of the lender\u0027s Bankline app for businesses, the bank has said.\u0026nbspWe’re aware that some customers may be experiencing issues logging in to Bankline.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.The preview of the album was additionally preceded by a preview clip of a film titled Jesus is Lord, which Kardashian West claimed in her Instagram Story will be screened in IMAX cinemas in October.It is currently unknown whether the mystery film is a documentary or a feature.Jesus is King is the second project from West to be shelved last-minute in less than a year.Yandhi, which was announced by Kardashian on Twitter, was expected to be released last September. It was then pushed back to a 23 November release date, but never arrived.

But it is still unclear how they might have formed, a question to which the answer could shed important light on how humanity and all other life on Earth was able to begin.Nasa scientists get unprecedented view as black hole rips apart a starTo conduct the experiment, the researchers used\u0026nbspan ultra-high vacuum reaction chamber to create a simulation of the conditions inside of those huge gaseous clouds. They constantly sprinkled a gaseous mixture of\u0026nbspwater, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and methanol onto a material made to simulate cosmic dust, which was cooled down to -263C, and then hit with lamps that could kick off chemical reactions.Out of that machine came an icy film that gathered on the simulation of the dust that was inside the chamber. When researchers warmed that up and then analysed it, they found those nucleobases that are required to create\u0026nbspDNA and RNA, which are in turn required for life.They also found other interesting materials, such as amino acids, which make up proteins.Our findings suggest that the processes we reproduced could lead to the formation of the molecular precursors of life, said\u0026nbspYasuhiro\u0026nbspOba\u0026nbspin a statement.

the dark about what they\u0027re buyingEnergy suppliers that do not generate or directly source green energy risk misleading customers by claiming they are “100 per cent renewable”, according to a report.Suppliers can be seen as “greenwashing” by purchasing certificates from companies that generate renewable electricity, which allow them to claim they provide zero-carbon energy, even though much of the power they actually supply may comes from fossil fuels, Which? has argued.Green Star Energy, Ovo Energy, Pure Planet, Robin Hood Energy, So Energy, Tonik Energy and Yorkshire Energy all sell “100 per cent renewable” electricity tariffs but do not generate any renewable energy themselves or buy any directly.Instead they buy Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) certificates, whose purpose is to prove to the final customer that a given share of energy was produced from renewable sources.The average household uses a little over 3MWh of electricity per year, meaning suppliers can buy the certificates to match this usage for only around £1.55 per customer and claim a tariff is “100 per cent renewable”.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all

doing little to support additional renewable energy supply.However, some suppliers hit back at the criticism. Steven Day, co-founder of Pure Planet, said that any suggestion it misled customers is untrue and that Which?’s report demonstrates a “fundamental misunderstanding of the way electricity is generated, certified, traded, managed by the grid and supplied”.He added: “All green suppliers have to use REGOs to verify that the electricity used by their customers is matched by electricity generated from renewable sources.”Which? analysed more than 300 energy tariffs and found that 40 suppliers sold what they described as 100 per cent renewable options.It said much greater clarity is needed around how “renewable” energy is defined and marketed to ensure customers aren’t misled.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others go a step further and generate renewable electricity themselves or buy it from those that do, rather than relying on REGO certificates.Both Ecotricity and Good Energy source enough renewable electricity to match their customers’ usage, but this tends to mean their costs are higher and therefore their tariffs are more expensive.Recognising that these firms directly support renewable energy, regulator Ofgem exempted both companies from its price cap on standard variable tariffs.Richard Headland at Which? said: “As consumers grow ever-more environmentally-conscious, it’s concerning that some suppliers appear to be ‘greenwashing’ their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers.“We believe there needs to be greater clarity on how renewable electricity is defined and marketed. People can only make informed decisions about where to buy their energy from if firms are more upfront and transparent about their green credentials.”Green Star Energy and Foxglove Energy both said they source all electricity from renewable generators, but Which? said the firms do not own renewable generation or have contracts with renewable generators and buy REGO certificates to match customers\u0027 use.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Robert De Niro plays the real-life Mafia hitman Frank Sheeran, the film chronicling his decades-long involvement with labour union teamster Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) and crime boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci).The $160 million drama, which marks Scorsese’s fifth collaboration with De Niro and Pesci and his first with Pacino, clocks in at over three and a half hours long, and has sparked intrigue ever since it was revealed that the film’s leading trio of actors were digitally “de-aged” for the film’s extensive flashback sequences.Others, such as Matt Zoller Seitz at RogerEbert, have additionally expressed dissatisfaction with the film’s relative lack of female characters, Zoller Seitz writing: “There’s nothing innately unacceptable about stories focusing mainly on men… But at the same time, I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Scorsese’s two greatest Mafia pictures, Goodfellas and Casino, carve out substantial space for wives, girlfriends, mothers and daughters.”Created with Sketch.35 great films that bombed at the box office Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.135 Children of Men (2006)While it\u0027s now revered as one of the best films of the 21st century, Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s dystopian thriller failed to make its money back at the box office at its time of release in 2006.235 The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988)This Robin Williams comedy grossed just $8m against its $46m budget, losing the studio a staggering $38m.Ali opened in the US on Christmas Day, 2001, and grossed a total of $87.7m worldwide – and still lost an estimated $63.1m.435 The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)Andrew Dominik\u0027s lyrical western only just made back half of its $30m budget in 2007, but found love upon its release on DVD.Despite starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron, this drama was a certified bomb at the box office, making a total of $19.6m from a $75m budget.Steven Spielberg\u0027s Roald Dahl adaptation grossed just $183m against its $140m budget – a low profit by Disney\u0027s standards.Michael Mann\u0027s cyber thriller was a box office bomb, earning only $19.7m at the box office against a budget of $70m.Just like Ridley Scott\u0027s original flopped, this lengthy sequel from Denis Villeneuve grossed just $259m worldwide and is considered a flop.This Orson Welles film may be a beloved classic, but at the time release, it failed to recoup its costs at the box office.

But its last half-hour is deeply moving in a way that creeps up on you, and it’s then that you see what Scorsese was working toward all along: A mini-history of late-20th century America as filtered through the eyes of a smalltime guy who needs and wants to believe in his own importance and capacity for decency—and who can’t see, though Scorsese can, that it’s the end of a life that tells the truth about the middle.”The Irishman is Martin Scorsese’s best crime movie since Goodfellas, and a pure, unbridled illustration of what has made his filmmaking voice so distinctive for nearly 50 years… the movie zips along at such a satisfying clip that its flaws rarely amount to more than mild speed bumps along the way.”Robert De Niro says he hopes ‘low life’ Trump gets impeachedProducers deny De Niro feud ousted Mickey Rourke from The IrishmanRobert De Niro recreated classic Goodfellas scene for The IrishmanThis is an Old Man movie — a slower late-period work by a filmmaker ruminating on his advancing age, and on the beloved classics he made as a younger guy. But it’s Scorsese’s version: pulsing with more life than most younger filmmakers, before giving way to stark, chilling regret.”The Irishman, I think he mostly maintains the proper perspective. These are bad guys who’ve done bad things, but in the movie’s whispery allegory, all that misdeed is a harsh metaphor for the scrambling we do in our own lives. In The Irishman’s arresting final act, Scorsese captures the smallness and loneliness of life, its pathetic flattening out—time, in some senses but not all, eventually erodes away all of our context.”The Irishman will be released in selected UK cinemas on 8 November, before arriving on Netflix from 27 November.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A protective award is additional redundancy compensation ordered by an employment tribunal if the staff weren’t consulted by their employer before being let go.Although there is no guarantee the claims will be successful, they are “worth bringing”, says Richard Linskell, employment partner at law firm Gunnercooke.“In this case, there’s an argument that the management knew about the insolvency in advance,” he adds.“Whether they knew about it long enough in advance to consult on redundancies is another matter. They were trying very hard to avoid the insolvency but that does not preclude them consulting at the same time.”Simpson Millar gave the example of one ex-employee who found out she had lost her job from a generic email at 1am on Monday morning.“We knew there were difficulties earlier in the year, but they were played down internally,” Claire Hoang from Stalybridge in Manchester was quoted as saying.In other cases, former Thomas Cook workers did not even receive the email and instead learnt of their fate via the news, the law firm said.Ex-employees can claim a protective award only if they were made redundant alongside at least 19 other people at the same place of work. That would exclude people from smaller Thomas Cook stores.The compensation is separate from basic redundancy pay and wages and benefits owed, but both are paid by the government’s Insolvency Service if the employer has gone under. \u0026nbspAccording to the latest figures from the Insolvency Service, 6,002 out of 9,041 Thomas Cook employees in the UK have been made redundant since the firm collapsed on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A Labour government would move towards a 32-hour working week, raise the minimum wage to “at least £10 an hour”, ban zero-hours contracts and give all workers full employment rights from day one of employment, he pledged.He said he believed in “working to live, not living to work”.Eyes will now turn to the Conservative Party conference, which is scheduled to get underway on Sunday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The least we can do is take care of those they leave behind.These failings are immoral and they are a direct assault on military effectiveness and therefore the defence of our country.Why  Because they corrode the morale of our servicemen and women.However many ultra-sophisticated aircraft carriers, F combat fighters, tanks and missiles we supply, the morale of the fighting man will always remain the cornerstone of combat power.High morale achieves miracles in battle, low morale leads to disaster and defeat.Low morale also makes people vote with their feet, signing off for civilian jobs where they will be properly looked after.This helps explain the woeful undermanning in the forces today, where recruiting has failed miserably to keep up with outflow.Yet a government that hopes to plug the gaping hole by increasing recruitment of soldiers from the Commonwealth shoots itself in both feet. It has made it virtually impossible for many recruits to be joined here by their families due to petty bureaucracy that could be overcome at a stroke.The Sun’s Never Forget Them campaign led the Government in July to create an Office for Veterans’ Affairs, with direct access to the Cabinet, with a new minister for Defence People and Veterans heading it.At the same time the PM promised the Government would: “Do all it can to support our Armed Forces from the day they enlist and for the rest of their lives.”No one expects overnight transformation.But after two months we have not heard one single new idea on tackling all of these age-old problems from the minister, Johnny Mercer.Mr Mercer is no ordinary politician. He’s a distinguished and courageous former soldier who fought in Afghanistan during three tours of duty and a man who I and many veterans admire and respect.He went “on strike” during Theresa May’s premiership in protest at the prosecution of British troops over historical allegations from the Northern Ireland campaign.Yet only last week we witnessed the opening of a murder trial against an elderly former soldier for alleged crimes in Londonderry half a century ago.Mr Mercer could not have done anything to prevent this.But he has not explained to the public how he intends to halt the disgraceful hounding of veterans through the courts in what is the greatest betrayal of their own Armed Forces by any government in history.In response to the Defence Committee report Mr Mercer tweeted: “I will offer a private informal session to the committee and update on every single issue raised.”Such discretion would be the way of a soldier but it is not what we expect from political leaders.The British public, as well as serving soldiers and veterans, are outraged by the abuse of our troops and those who have served.What we demand is to be told about solutions that will be actioned as soon as possible.Mr Mercer has experience of the issues raised in the latest report and served on the Defence Committee.Since entering Parliament in  he has campaigned energetically to sort out the plight of both servicemen and veterans, describing it as his main mission.If he was new to the forces’ problems we could understand he might need time to gain understanding and consider possible options.But he was selected because he has a deep understanding and experience and should have been able to announce his programme on day one.I worked at the centre of government for years and know the quagmire that confronts a minister trying to fight through a bureaucracy resistant to change and adept at wielding the civil service machinery that exists to frustrate progress.But Mr Mercer must find the resolve to overcome these obstacles. He should adopt Churchill’s dictum of “action this day”.There is no time for private briefings, blusterings and paralysis.Our troops are deployed on operations around the globe today. And who knows when the next intense battle will begin, whether over Russian expansion, Iranian aggression, or Chinese provocation, or something totally unforeseen We expect our fighting men and women to lay down their livesnecessary.It is vital that the Government and Mr Mercer do everything they can totheir courage and dedication in deeds as well as words.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They scream “You should be in jail”, then faint with shock at his far more moderate language.Labour call Tories “dirty”, “callous” or even “murderers”. Their IRA-backing shadow chancellor sniggers about lynching a female Tory.The Left cheers as a rapper waves the severed head of a Boris effigy on stage. Then they clutch their pearls when the PM pushes back.The Lib Dems scream “B***ocks to Brexit”— then demand everyone ELSE tones down their language.Speaker Bercow is right. The Commons is “toxic”. But he is blind to his blatant Remain bias helping to create it.Voters can see what this is: An organised assault to topple Boris and Brexit.Many MPs are feigning offence for effect — and for their Twitter fans. A few are genuinely upset, but only because they have mistaken their bid to reverse or ­neuter Brexit for a noble cause.It is not. Not after you have voted for a binding referendum, promised repeatedly to enact it and put the result in law.Boris calls it a “betrayal” because it is.He calls the rogue Act forcing him to beg another delay from the EU on their terms a “surrender” because it is.No, Yvette Cooper, his words are not “designed to escalate ision and hatred”. They accurately describe hugely powerful emotions, justiably felt by millions of Leavers and brought on by those politicians blocking Brexit.In  these Remainers could have accepted defeat, as others did. Instead they sided with a minority who refused, who chose to denigrate Leavers as thick racists, who willed them on to die, who promoted baseless conspiracies to delegitimise the vote.And who would now pour petrol on this fire they have started by forcing on our riven nation a second referendum openly rigged for Remain.That’s why Leavers feel betrayed.That’s what lies behind their rage.What excuse do Remainers have for theirs  That they lost  That one man still stands inconveniently between them and their destruction of a historic democratic mandate  That’s shameful.We deplore all the hatred and any targeting of MPs. We feel for their families.But how about some self-awareness and contrition from Remainer MPs, especially the malicious extremists of the hard-Left, about their own starring role in causing it IT is terrying to see vaccination rates for dangerous childhood diseases dropping.Some of it is parental idleness. Some is the spread of long-debunked internet scare stories.All families MUST be made to get kids their jabs before rates fall so low these illnesses can take hold.If that needs fines or exclusions, so be it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Seventy-five years you waited.”“You can see me now, cant you ”Weeping, Sana replies: “Good to see you.”The last time the two men saw each other was when they were living in Romania where they grew up as close friends.That was until a fascist uprising saw the government deposed and their country become a puppet state of the Nazis.Both managed to flee with their separate families, meaning neither had any idea the other had survived the holocaust, People reports.Sana eventually settled in Ra’anana, Israel, while Mairowitz lived in the UK.They were finally reunited when Sanas daughter began connecting with her long-lost cousins on Facebook and then realised Mairowitz was alive. That led Mairowitz to fly from Britain to Tel Aviv last week where he reunited with Sana in an emotional moment which was caught on camera. At the start of the footage, Sana can be seen walking into a hotel room filled with smiling relatives where Mairowitz is waiting for him.As he turns the corner he cracks a smile and holds his arms in the air as he recognises his old pal.

Remainers is this what youre about Share this, we must have our remainer MPs explaining their vile incitement to violence.Another added: Amazon is selling a book inciting violence against the democratic majority who won the referendum  voted Leave.Is this ok behaviour in a democracy from the Remainer Establishment Remainer Publishing, the listed seller for the toxic product, wrote: Get this journal notebook and put a smile on the face of anyone who is against Brexit, who voted Britain to stay, who dont want Britain to leave the European Union!This is a great notebook journal for all anti-Brexit Remainers and Pro-Europeans, Anti Leave British supporters who want Britain to remain in the European Union.Customers on Amazon were disgusted over the notebook as one wrote in the review section: I hope this has been reported to the police for inciting hate.Another added: Would give zero starsI could. I am reporting this.Amazon has not commented on the listing, but has since taken it down.The PM was attacked on Wednesday by MPs for suggesting that the best way to honour the memory of murdered MP Jo Cox was to get Brexit done.He infuriated MPs by brushing off their concerns about his use of language in the Commons as humbug in more astonishing scenes.Paula Sherf told him many Labour MPs were being subjected to death threats from people quoting his words such as “Surrender Act”, “traitor” or “betrayal”.The PM dismissed her comments as “humbug” and on Wednesday refused to answer demands for an apology in the Commons — sending a junior minister instead.Brendan Cox — Jo’s widower — said he felt “sick” to see her name used by the PM. And former ­Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was a “disgrace” Mr Johnson did not apologise.Yesterday, Mr Johnson admitted that tempers need to come down in the furious row over political language and Jo Cox.He said he would carry on using the phrase to describe a new law - but stressed that MPs must be careful about what language they use to avoid inciting violence.The Sun Online contacted Downing Street for a comment."},{"url":null,"title":"baby 16 weeks premature 1st birthday","story":"Haris was born  weeks premature, weighing just lb oz and given little chance of survival by doctors.His lungs were under-developed and diseased, leaving him unable to breathe on his own.After he clung to le for two weeks, his parents, Ellie Barr, , and Hassan Mockbill, , were told to say their goodbyes.Doctors tried one last-ditch treatment, a course of steroids, and, against all odds, it worked. Weeks later, Haris was well enough to leave intensive care.A year on, he weighs a stone, is taking his first steps and growing into the playful, cheeky boy his parents hoped for.Community worker Ellie said: “He overcame everything that was thrown at him. He never gave up.“We are a perfect little family now and it was so worth all of the fighting.”Ellie, from Birmingham, experienced frequent heavy bleeding throughout her pregnancy and was closely monitored by doctors at the city’s Heartlands Hospital.But, on July  last year, after one heavy bout of bleeding, Haris was born at  weeks — days after the legal limit for an abortion.Ellie, who has a two-year-old son, Elias, said: “He just decided he was coming. I had to push.“We had no ideahe was alive or not. I couldn’t hold him until he was ten days old.

But Haris’s lungs were not strong enough to work alone and he was dependent on a ventilator.At two weeks, his health faded as his lungs filled with fluid.Ellie and Hassan, a roadside assistant, were taken into a room and told their son probably would not make it through the day.Ellie said: “He was really struggling to breathe and his body was shutting down.“I tried to cling on to any bit of hope but the doctors said it would probably be our last day with him.”Doctors injected him with steroids to clear the fluid from his lungs.The eight-day course saved his le and Ellie said: “When he pulled through we just couldn’t believe it. He has never stopped fighting.”At  weeks, his condition had improved and Haris was transferred to a special care ward.To celebrate this major breakthrough, the family held a special graduation ceremony.

Our ships were exhausted.”Mr Wallace also revealed he discovered a pilot training programme with a backlog of  trainees, meaning “we don’t have enough pilots to fly all our planes we’ve been buying”.He added: “This money will help us fix the problems in that pilot training.”Most alarming of all, Mr Wallace said he also discovered how low the Army’s ammunition stocks had got, as his successors saved cash by not replenishing them.He said: “They were never critical, but they would have got close to being a real challenge.“If you don’t have a proper funded plan to make sure that those stocks are maintained, they start to drop below.”Winning the funding battle with the Treasury was dficult, but Mr Wallace revealed: “Boris came to the rescue. He didn’t have to, but he did.”The £.bn cash injection only lasts until , when Mr Wallace admits the MoD will have to wage the same fight for more money again.But he says he won a key admission from No and No that the defence funding crisis must be solved for the long-term then too.Mr Wallace added: ““There is recognition by Boris Johnson, No and the Treasury now that in that we have to think that short termism has actually led to more expensive consequences.“Long-term financial planning alongside long-term ambitions is the way you get a best value for money, but also a modern st century Armed Forces that achieves the security of the country.”Shameful standards in barracks blocks will also benefit from the new money.The defence boss declared: “We have been housing our men and women in dilapidated, not fit for purpose accommodation. This new money is going to be focused often on things like that.”Mr Wallace also has bold plans to offer service families far better childcare to match the needs of a modern age.Mr Wallace is the first Defence Secretary to have been a regular serviceman since Harold Macmillan in the .During his eight years of service, he carried out several tours of Northern Ireland during the Troubles – meaning he knows what it likes to be on the receiving end of bad political leadership.He added: “The most precious equipment we have to defend our nation are the men and women.“If we don’t have the men and women with the right skills, with the right morale in our armed forces, we can’t deliver any real defence.“That’s why as long as I am Defence Secretary, I am determined to not overstretch them, not overspend and to be honest about what we can and can’t do to the rest of government.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It wasn’t to be.I first noticed Demi in , when she appeared in the movie Ghost, as fresh-faced, husky-voiced Molly, mourning the death of her husband Sam, played by Patrick Swayze.She looked adorable, with elfin cropped hair, little make-up and denim dungarees.Everyone wanted to look like this particularly gorgeous “girl next door” and that role catapulted her on to Hollywood’s A-list.Demi made a string of successful but rather questionable movies including Indecent Proposal, Striptease and GI Jane and demanded such high fees she was dubbed “Gimme Moore”, the sort of snarky comment that would never be made about a male actor.Her marriage to Bruce Willis made them the Brad and Angelina of their day, but just like that relationship, theirs too ended in tears and failure.Demi and Bruce went on to declare a truce and he was even at the launch of her new book in a show of support — although you do have to wonderhe had actually read what his ex had written about him.She claims that at the height of her fame he wanted her out of Hollywood so she could be a stay-at-home mum for their children.What strikes me about Demi’s story — from her being raped as a vulnerable  year old, to her complete ­mental breakdown after her marriage to Kutcher fell apart — was what a deeply unhappy le she has led.I honestly don’t know how any young girl would recover from being raped by a disgusting pervert who she claims “bought her” for a few hundred dollars from her alcoholic mother.How on Earth are you supposed to deal with such a horric betrayal from the one person who is supposed to love and protect you from harm It is very sad that Demi said she always felt that she was to blame for the appalling ordeal inflicted upon her by her mother and a man old enough to be her father.I think deep down she’s still that frightened, betrayed little girl who never thinks she is quite good enough.Demi writes movingly about being desperate to have a child with Kutcher.Shortly after their marriage she became pregnant, but tragically the baby died when she was six months pregnant.Again she blamed herself for the loss, and started drinking heavily.The relationship never really recovered. Years later ,just before the couple split, I interviewed Kutcher and it wasn’t a happy experience for all concerned.He wasn’t unpleasant, just deeply uncomfortable and clearly didn’t want to be promoting his latest project, but it was in his contract to so do.Everyone that day received monosyllabic replies and it was no surprise when the news broke shortly afterwards that his marriage to Demi had crumbled and that was when she started to really unravel.Even though on the outside Demi appeared to have everything — fame, enormous wealth, three healthy children and a handsome actor on her arm — inside she was a mass of ­anxiety and insecurities as she lurched from one crisis to the next.She came close to death a year after the split while partying with her oldest daughter Rumer. Demi suffered a seizure after taking drugs and inhaling nitrous oxide.That was a wake-up call for her to seek help and get her act together. Writing the book is apparently all part of the healing process.It won’t have been an easy read for her three grown-up daughters who, unsurprisingly, have apparently had their own issues with either substance abuse or insecurity about their bodies.I honestly do wonderanyone in Hollywood, especially those who find fame because of their good looks and winning smiles, are living happy, ­contented and fulfilled lives.It doesn’t look like it, and it’s deeply sad that a seemingly confident, extremely beautul woman such as Demi should have felt so worthless.All credit to her for coming back from the brink and having the guts to tell her story in her own words.But there is always collateral damage when you decide to be so honest, and I hope she is strong enough to weather the inevitable storms gathering on the horizon.Harry and Meghan brought out a secret weapon during their visit to South Africa and instantly blew away all the negativity and criticism they have experienced this year.With one cute smile and a whole lot of gurgles, baby Archie has completely rehabilitated his parents and shown them in a much happier and far more positive light.It is the first time we have properly seen the four month old and you do wonder why they haven’t shown him to the world before now.Everybody loves a baby, and Archie is a poppet, as well as being Harry’s absolute double.He has a sunny disposition and is obviously adored by his besotted mum and dad. The wee chap looked delighted to be on his first proper outing as a member of the royal firm.And Meghan is in her element. She appeared happy, relaxed and has managed to get her “look” just right.There were no designer frocks nor ostentatious jewellery. Instead it was all sustainable dresses, High Street shoes and lots of recycled outfits.Harry and Meghan have both shone a light on some hugely deserving causes and charities close to their hearts.They work well together, as well as being effective on their own, and it’s refreshing to hear them speak to the media like normal people, instead of the usual dry, formal speeches.It is in places such as Africa that they can both do such a lot of good and build on the pioneering charity work carried out by Harry’s late mum Princess Diana.Meghan telling young South African girls she is a woman of colour who feels like their sister means they can truly relate to her. The words were inspired and from the heart.There are rumours that in the future Harry, Meghan and Archie would spend half the year in southern Africa, and I reckon it’s a good idea.I’ve been lucky enough to visit this incredible part all of the world and it grabs you by the heart and doesn’t let go.Like Harry, I share a particular love of beautul Botswana, and would be delighted for themthey were lucky enough to set up a home from home there.They would be under much less pressure and scrutiny than here in the UK and able to lead almost normal lives should they so wish.Meanwhile Harry, Meghan – and especially Archie – continue with the charm offensive, breaking down barriers and becoming a force to be reckoned with.Diana would be very proud.Recycle your clothes instead of having wardrobes stuffed with cheap fashion.Stop buying plastic-wrapped fast food and maybe think about turning the bloody lights off when you leave a room.Just a thought . . .I HONESTLY think we are in imminent danger of completely losing our sense of humour and turning into a nation of po-faced bores.I couldn’t believe the reaction I got when I cheekily asked smouldering actor Jason Isaacshe was wearing shorts in an upcoming charity run for Great Ormond Street Hospital, and that I would happily run behind him for the view.It was a cheeky remark made to a delightfully naughty man, who I have interviewed many times.I knew he wouldn’t be offended in the least but would laugh heartily, which is exactly what happened. I also thought it was a fun way to promote a terric cause.I was astonished to be labelled “sexist” and “inappropriate”, which is completely OTT for such innocuous remarks.People really need to get things into perspective.Dan has brought us some of the top names in TV, movies and music, covered all the big award ceremonies and always delivers the most entertaining gossip.Here’s to the next decade of scoops, scandals and showbiz shenanigans.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will trash it for the sake of a dog whistle.”New Work and Pensions boss Thérèse Coffey blasted Labour’s completely reckless ideas to rip up the current welfare policies.She said: “This is totally irresponsible from Jeremy Corbyn - who now admits he would happily scrap financial support for vulnerable people with no plan as to what Labour would replace it with.“It’s reckless, political point scoring from a Party that spent years trapping people on benefits and holding them back from the opportunities that would help them build a better future for them and their families.“It is because of policies like Universal Credit that we have supported over .m people into work since , incomes are rising at their fastest pace in over a decade and income inequality is close to a -year low.“But we know there is more to do to make the system work better for those who need it most, and this why we have recently increased the amount people can earn before their benefits are reduced by £, a year.”Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment.

Hatty, the Thomas cook wedding co-ordinatar, for working for free.Lindos Wedding Karen Harvey, for offering for services for free make up and photography by Antonis Giannelis.And Charlotte Samantha for the GoFundMe page.We are looking forward to our wedding reception when wehome and seeing all of our family and friends.The pair, from Hucknall, Notts, flew out last week and were due to marry at the hotel on the Greek island of Rhodes, but their plans were thrown into chaos when Thomas Cook announced it would cease trading.The couple had paid out £, with the now bust travel firm to plan their big day and fly out family and friends.The Thomas Cook package the couple had paid for was set to include the wedding ceremony, flowers, cake, decorations and entertainment.But the devastated couple were left stranded on the Greek Island and told the ceremony may not go ahead.Thomas, who works for Rolls-Royce, told Nottinghamshire Live on Monday: Thomas Cook promised us a surprise on our wedding because of my name but this was not the surprise we were expecting.I am just devastated. We have got more than  friends and family coming out, half are stuck at home in limbo. My best man is still in England. No one here knows anything.I have been planning this for two years and it has all gone to pot. We have paid for everything. It is shattering.We dont know what we can do. Thomas Cook staff have been good but they lost their jobs.The couple, who have been together for  years, decided to marry abroad because it was cheaper to marry in Rhodes than having a wedding in the UK.However, when the hotel heard the news, they stepped in to save the couples dream wedding, pulling out all the stops to ensure Thomas and Amelia had their special day after two years of planning.Giorgos Bakas, manager at the Lindos Princess hotel told Sun Online:He just looked so disappointed and we didn’t want him to leave like that.We are honoured that he has come to our hotel, our island and Greece. Many guests were already in Rhodes when the news broke, with only the best man having to book an alternative flight, with the whole wedding party will be flown home on repatriation flights after the big day.Thomas Cook went bust in the early hours of Monday morning after failing to secure a last-ditch rescue deal, with all future flights and holidays cancelled.As many as , Thomas Cook employees among , staff around the world have also lost their jobs - many who have bravely ploughed on today to help the holidaymakers affected."},{"url":null,"title":"beyonce jay z fame blue ivy","story":"Perhaps the main one is that she’s had her own personal stylist and shopper since she could toddle her way on to the red carpet, and she is only seven years old.At one Grammy Awards, for example, she wore a white Valery Kovalska tuxedo pantsuit with sparkling silver shoes and a beaded black clutch.That was the time — remember  — when at the age of six she shushed her parents from clapping too loudly when Camila Cabello introduced U to the stage.A couple of years ago she was actually named “best dressed” at the Grammy’s thanks to her pink Gucci power suit.Sitting on the front row watching her mother perform, she had the poise of someone five times her age.While other celebrities tend to shield their children from the public eye, Jay Z and Beyonce seem to have positively ushered their daughter towards it.They have been bringing her with them on tour and to ious award shows and events at which, thanks to her stylist, she often looks more fashionable than her parents.So there’s that.Butit’s hard to fathom a child in a Gucci suit, try getting your head around this: At the age of seven, when most children are still harbouring fantasies of being an astronaut, or a unicorn, little Blue Ivy, it turns out, wants to be recognised as a “cultural icon”.Well, I say Blue Ivy, but clearly it is her parents who are pushing this agenda.Beyonce and Jay Z have been seeking to trademark either “Blue Ivy” or “Blue Ivy Carter” for several years.The problem is that someone  has already trademarked the name. Beyonce has been involved in a trade-mark dispute for years against Wendy Morales, whose wedding planning business goes by the same name.Beyonce is outraged at the idea that Blue Ivy Carter, “the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world”, might be confused with a boutique wedding event planning business.Which is unlikely, when you really think about it.So you might wonder why — really — Beyonce gives a flying fig about the fact that it has the same name as her daughter.But I guess — unless you are the mother of a cultural icon — it’s hard for mere mortals like us to understand.Beyonce has accused Morales of riding her coattails. Who knows, maybe she is. But so what What seems more relevant is the degree to which these parents apparently view their daughter as an extension of themselves.They care more about their fame and reputation than they do about letting Blue Ivy forge her own path, find her own identity and be herself.Yes, we all pass on our values and, to a degree, our aspirations to our children.But we all owe it to our kids to be aware of where we stop and they begin.And it seems to me that Beyonce and Jay Z are robbing their daughter of her childhood and suffocating her with their own aspirations.We only have to take one look around at those who haven’t been allowed proper childhoods — Michael Jackson, Macaulay Culkin, Aaron Carter — to see how badly things can go wrong.Forget designer clothes and cultural icon status, the best thing Blue Ivy’s parents could give her is a proper childhood.We all think our kids are special. Most of us do our best NOT to spoil our kids and keep them grounded, they seem to want the opposite.They need to teach her that money and status is not as important as family, values, morals, kindness — and friends. THIS week I am mainly feeling fed up with politicians.I voted Remain because the chaos of leaving far outweighed any problems of staying in.But the country voted Leave and I accepted that. What’s the point in asking the country to votethe result is ignored Three years on and we are still waiting to leave. Boris Johnson is at least trying to honour the people’s decision.Jo Swinson for the Lib Debs, who is held up as a shining new light in politics, has said thather party wins an election – most unlikely – she will cancel Brexit on the basis that on the first vote the margin for Leave was so small and people didn’t know what they were voting for.But those are just excuses. She, and others, think they know best and would no doubt keep having the vote until they get the result they want – to remain in Europe.Politicians are trying to force a Remain outcome, through delays to Brexit, not calling a general election and following their own views on the EU rather than that of the country.But crashing out without a deal is not what really worries me. It’s the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn government.Here is a man who sympathises with Russia – although they came here and killed people, including poisoning a police officer.A man who sympathises with the IRA, met with Hamas and Hezbollah and refused to sing the National Anthem.A man who wants to close private schools and implement a four-day week .This is a man who wants to introduce a right-to-buy scheme for private tenants and force landlords to sell their buy-to-rent properties for less than they are worth, leaving them in debt – then also clobber them with higher taxes.He wants to nationalise industry and confiscate £billion of shares in , large companies and hand them to workers.As Margaret Thatcher said, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money.I hope politicians knock their heads together, compromise, get out of Europe and focus on the future outside of the EU – new trade deals, new investments, jobs and innovation.This is a great country, let’s hope it remains so.I KNOW Phoebe Waller- Bridge is not for everyone – although her telly show Fleabag is pretty damned funny.But whether you like her or not, she is currently on a serious roll.TV awards left, right and centre including Emmys and Baftas – and now she has just signed a £million deal with Amazon.Her talent is incredible.IN her new memoirs, Demi Moore has criticised ex-husband Ashton Kutcher for “shaming” her by sharing a picture of her in her underwear during their marriage.Apparently, he justied it at the time by saying that sharing a snap of Demi half-naked was just a “good-natured joke”.Really ACTOR Christopher Eccleston has revealed his lelong battle with anorexia – which some, who think of it as a woman’s affliction, may have found shocking.Meanwhile, F’s Lewis Hamilton has revealed he’s not happy with his body and has clearly spent his letime trying to become so.Both stories are reminders that men are becoming as fixated with their physiques as women have been all these years.What we are left with is a reality that no one – man or woman – is ever -per-cent happy with their looks.I most certainly am not.THIS Wednesday sees theof The Apprentice at pm on BBC .The show starts with a bang when Lord Sugar sends candidates off to South Africa to run a safari tour.When they don’t know the dference between an elephant and a rhino, you know it spells disaster . . .  but in a good way.This series is the best ever, so I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as we did making it.Freddy McConnell, , from Kent, wants to be registered as “father” or “parent”, despite having physically given birth to the baby – but a judge ruled against him.This is tricky, but the judge’s decision has to be the right one. Despite the wonders of modern science, men cannot, yet, give birth.That’s a fact.He was physically a woman when he gave birth and, although he may be legally male now, that’s another issue.WHATEVER Christie Brinkley is doing, she looks fantastic for .As she posed in a denim jumpsuit, looking decades younger she left me thinking I would love to know what she’s had done – as I would certainly do it.She obviously eats well and exercises – but she has also had surgery, which she is very honest about.Others have had it and look strange, but Christie looks fresh and youthful. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They handed victory to an anti-democratic political movement hell-bent on stopping the .million majority getting what MPs promised.They effectively granted the power to rule not to our actual Government but to a rogue Speaker and an unelected Remainer pseudo-government too cowardly to seek a mandate.

Tensions can run high, families have Brexit disagreements, so do neighbours, and Twitter and Facebook can unearth the strongest of opinions. So Parliament must take a lead and show it can have a respectful debate. To say I was disappointed with the language used by Boris Johnson this week would be an understatement.  I would plead with him to reduce the aggression and stop the finger-pointing. As the person who holds the highest position in the UK, Boris Johnson must show leadership. Sometimes this means holding your hands up and admitting that you made a mistake. Boris Johnson must apologise. While all MPs and elected representatives have a ­responsibility to lead by example, the rise of the far-right in the UK is ­responsible for attacks on minorities. Jo Cox was killed by a far-right extremist. Women MPs are issued rape threats, MPs of colour are told to “go back home”. These threats are not isolated. They sit within a ­society which is becoming increasingly aggressive towards minorities. This is the work of the far-right. Remember, just this month the police said that the fastest-growing UK terrorist threat is from the ­far-right.

One of the tour operators, Andy Denson, posted his vile snap as a souvenir of a hunt on his Facebook page. Thrill-seeker Pete Livesey smiles beside his bleeding “trophy” in another picture that will horry animal lovers. On the website of the popular Huntershill Safaris, Livesey says of his experience of killing an animal: “Never had so much fun with my pants on.”    Six other British tourists, including a woman, also grin after gunning down zebras for trophies on the website of ­another company called Umlilo Safaris. The zebra is classied as vulnerable on the International Union of the Conservation of Nature’s red list of threatened species. Yet the creatures are one of the most popular trophies for UK hunters – with hundreds of body parts hauled back here in recent years.    They are hunted on the South African plains, where it is not illegal. In the UK a ban on the import of sick souvenirs from trophy-hunters such as Denson and Livesey is now being urgently considered by government ministers. Zac Goldsmith, animal welfare ­minister, told the Sunday People this week: “I look at the photos and it turns my stomach.”    Mr Goldsmith pledged a consultation on stopping the imports of trophy hunt parts with view to stopping this vile trade. Hunter Denson is one of the country’s top taxidermists – turning murdered ­animals into ghoulish figures to be hung on walls. He is also cashing in by helping to set up trips to slaughter big game, claiming it is for conservation. The -year-old from Padiham, Lancs, is listed as the UK agent for Thaba Thala Safaris – ­popular with ­hunters from the UK.    Wealthy Brits have bragged about their ­cruel ­exploits during the trips, which start at £, for seven days. Hunters can add animals to kill from a list of  species, including £ to add a zebra and £ ­taxidermy fees. But Eduardo Goncalves of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting branded the safaris as evil. He said: “So many of Africa’s greatest wild animals are ­already suffering thanks to the vile trophy ­hunting industry. “Now ­zebras have joined the list. In April last year zebras were ­officially listed as vulnerable. The Grévy’s zebra species is listed as ­endangered.“What is it going to take to stop these killers from wiping out our wildle completely   “Unbelievably, there are ­hardly any legal ­restrictions on shooting zebras for fun.”Denson, who has been a taxidermist for  years, boasts how he has slaughtered “every species in the eastern Cape” of South Africa and how he “love hunting but love hunting ­alongside my son even more”. On his website he adds: “I was born and bred in the countryside and feel ­I ­understand country le and the wildle that lives within it. “For the past  years I’ve provided a full taxidermy ­service mounting birds, ­mammals and specialising in deer, African and exotic shoulder and pedestal mounts from my ­studio in Padiham, Lancashire. “In the early s my family relocated to the eastern cape of South Africa where they have lived ever since. “My auntie was a manager on one of the biggest privately owned game reserves in South Africa and for the past  years I have spent most of my time studying and hunting there. “I have been glad to see my son follow in my footsteps to become a very well ­respected professional hunter and fisherman taking clients out to fulfil their African dreams.”Mr Goncalves said: “No wonder our wildle is in the terrible situation that it’s in. There needs to be an ­immediate moratorium on the sport-hunting of all threatened animals. “The Government should ban imports of ­hunting trophies and call on other countries to join it. It’s the only way to end this evil trade.” Latest estimates put the ­remaining population of zebras at , – less than one-tenth the number of African ­elephants. And the zebra’s popularity among British trophy hunters is making the picture worse, ­according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Between - UK hunters brought in  zebra trophies.In the following decade, -, the number jumped to  zebra trophies, up  per cent.    Zebra are legal to hunt in South Africa and hunt organisers charge cheaper fees for them.By ­contrast it costs tens of thousands of pounds to hunt lions and elephants.Another firm attracting Brits is Huntershill in South Africa.Pete Livesey is pictured on the Huntershill site next to a slaughtered zebra with his boast about how much fun he is having with his pants on.

Residents of the private properties in Westbourne Place, where homes have been sold for £,, were given fobs to enable access to the communal garden. But social housing residents were denied the privilege and instead locked out of these spaces. Octavia blocked access to these spaces to avoid tenants facing the financial burden of high service charges, which were originally set by developer Redrow but are now managed by Pinnacle Property Management which runs the private side of the development. Redrow’s original plans for the luxury flats showed the gardens to be accessible for all those who lived there. These plans were approved by Westminster Council, but are now the subject of an enforcement investigation by council officers.

In March, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and former housing minister James Brokenshire spoke on the topic of segregating communal gardens, promising to change the law to ban the shameful practice.

Everyone was so helpful. “I want to see this woman eye to eye and tell her how thankful I am. Without her I wouldn’t be here. I was told she did CPR for  minutes until the ambulance arrived.

The likelihood of CPR working after being performed for thatof time is a bit of a miracle. If it wasn’t for this person things could have turned out so dferent. It is a miracle that this person was there at  o’clock in the morning, in my dad’s pizza shop and was able to do this for him. “We are so grateful.

Excitement grew in the months leading up to the special day back in , and fans were fascinated by every detail. They wanted to know about the venue, the decorations, the reception, the guestlist - but of course the most interesting detail with every wedding is the brideaposs dress. Like all women preparing to walk down the aisle, Kate wanted to keep the designer creating her dress a secret and did everything she could to keep the details out of the press.    But there was a leak and the name of the woman behind the dress - Alexander McQueenaposs Sarah Burton - got out in the lead up to the big day. Speaking on Channel  documentary Secrets of the Royal Dressmakers, royal expert Katie Nicholl discussed how much this upset the future Duchess of Cambridge. She said: Behind the scenes I think that caused tears at the Palace because Kate had done everything she could to keep the wedding dress a secret.At the time, The Sunday Times  reported: A fashion source said that the dress will be a combination of Middletonaposs own design ideas and Burtonaposs deep knowledge and understanding of high fashion.   Burton, of course, denied any involvement until she was officially announced as the designer when Kate stepped out of the car in front of Westminster Abbey. And the leak didnapost seem to bother Kate on the big day. She was the most beautul bride and she couldnapost have looked happier to marry her prince. Her dress - a stunning ivory gown with a satin bodice and lace sleeves - was a huge hit with fashion critics and fans around the world.Burton attended the royal wedding and styled Kateaposs dress before she walked down the aisle, making sure everything was perfect.    Wedding dress designer Caroline Castigliano says the big reveal was still special, even though the designer had been leaked.She said: Everybody loved Kate’s dress. That excitement when she stepped out, it was just ‘wow’. Incredible. She looked sensational. Even now it gives me butterflies.    Burton used traditional Carrickmacross craftsmanship in making the dress, a technique which dates back to the s, to represent apossomething oldapos. The attention to detail was breathtaking – from the hand-cut Chantilly lace of the sleeves, to the lace applique on the bodice and the inidual lace roses, thistles, daffodils and shamrocks hand-engineered on to the ivory silk tulle. The skirt was crafted with white satin gazar arches and pleats to echo an opening flower. And the weight of the silk tulle underskirt and .m train ensured it glided along.

The betting company has accepted a flurry of bets in the last week on Kate being pregnant after she made several public appearances. Kate, , was snapped with a new hairdo while taking Princess Charlotte to her first day at school two weeks ago - which led to pregnancy rumours online. She also touched up her hair up seven weeks before she announced she was pregant with Prince George and shortly before revealing she was going to give birth to Princess Charlotte. Body language expert Judi James told Daily Star Online: “Like a lot of women Kate does tend to change her hair when she is pregnant, although not dramatically.    “The new style and colour she emerged with when she took George and Charlotte to school did look like one of her glossiest and most fashionable looks to date. “But then she did say she’d had it done for the school run, and it could have been aimed at giving her an emotional lt as Charlotte left home for school for the first time.” Judi also said that another sign Kate is pregnant is that she was pictured touching her belly during her visit to the school. “Kate did meet a lot of small children and one baby in particular recently and it wasn’t hard to describe her teeth-baring, dimple-creating smile of utter delight as she stroked the baby’s head and chatted to the children as broodiness,” she said. “She also touched her belly, which is a common gesture of protection from women in the early stages of pregnancy. “However this is a gesture that Kate uses a lot, pregnant or not, so tends to be less than reliable as a clue. She did look broody but she appears besotted with youngest child Louis and the baby she met could just have reminded her of him.”    Celebrity stylist Jay Birmingham told Fabulous Digital: “Kate’s new colour has brightened her complexion and the use of lighter pieces throughout the top of her hair and around her face add dimension and give the illusion of thicker hair. The signs have forced Ladbrokes to pull the plug on all bets on Kate having a baby in . Alex Apati of Ladbrokes told the Star: Royal fans reckon Kate is showing early signs of a potential pregnancy. Weaposve welcomed two royal babies into the world in as many years and punters are seemingly confident Kate will make it three in three. “Weaposve taken a flurry of bets across the country in shop over the last week or so following recent royal appearances from the Duchess of Cambridge.

Tracey Deimert canapost remember her wedding, birth of her children or anything  that happened in the first  years of her le. She only has pictures to reflect on treasured moments and relatives who have since died, but she cannot recall ever meeting, reports Somerset Live. The -year-old was visiting parents Sue and Trevor in Bridgwater, when suddenly, her heart stopped inexplicably and she collapsed in the kitchen. The then -year-old, also from Bridgwater, was without a pulse for  agonising minutes, causing a hypoxic brain injury.  Her husband Garry was warned by doctors that her brain had been starved of oxygen for so long that it was very likely she would remain in a persistent aposvegetative stateapos. But Tracey, a former dispensing optometrist, had other ideas. Iaposm a fighter. Even when things are down, you should never give up, she said. Against all the odds, Traceyaposs eyes flickered open in what was a aposmiraculousapos turn of events. But everything she had experienced in her -years her childhood, her marriage, the birth of her sons Cameron and Bradley - she remembers none of it. When she awoke in hospital, Garry and her two kids were looking on at her but she showed not the faintest recognition of who they were.    Garry said: She didnapost know I was her husband and that she had two children. All her memories had gone forever. It was heartbreaking for us. It took months for her to learn how to speak again and when she did, those memories remained lost. She had no idea who we were. She asked me, aposWho are those people  and I said, aposThey are your sonsapos, said Garry. Then she said, aposWho is that person in the picture apos, and I said, aposThat is you on your wedding day.apos With a smile she said, aposI look pretty.apos It was heartbreaking for us. For her to ask this was so hard to take. She loved us all very much and then she didnapost know who we were. It was unbelievably dficult to take.   months on from her fall, Tracey was taken back to her home and set about trying to continue her le again. But it wasnapost easy. She had to learn how to speak, eat, talk and walk again. I had forgotten who I was, said Tracey. It was the worst thing, a complete memory loss. I wish I could remember more. There was nothing wrong with my heart. The doctors couldnapost find out why it just stopped. They said I was going to be in a vegetative state. They said I was non-responsive. But I am a big fighter. For some reason, I can remember music and how to dance. Pictures sometimes help, but most of it has gone.  My motor skills are not very good. One day I went for a walk and got lost. I was very scared. But a friend found me and brought me home. I didnapost remember my home when I first came back from hospital. Tracey cannot recall when she met Garry as a teenager at school. She also cannot remember when they dated there for a while, when they broke up and when they got back together again, after both had marriages of their own, in . Garry says, however, that he is trying to give her great, new memories for her to treasure, but le is still not easy. She never lost her memory of music. She can sing along to loads of songs and remember the words, said Garry, a maintenance technician at Hinkley Point power station.  She can read but she cannot really make sense of it. Her memory is still affected. She struggles to do everyday things. But her recovery was miraculous. The original prognosis was that she was not going to recover at all. There was no response for four weeks. Her recovery should be celebrated. She is a medical marvel. He added: It was just horrendous. She was, and still is, the nicest person in the world. Sheaposs the most beautul, loving and amazing person I have ever met. Sometimes she does get very frustrated. She used to drive, work and do lots of things. Now, she canapost do a lot of those things. But she has made real progress. Exactly  years on from the ordeal, she has made big strides with the help of her family, friends and Brunelcare.

Tiny Ellia Tomlinson became the youngest member of the five-generation family when she was born on July , weighing lb oz.    Hollie, of Grimsby, said: She is certainly a miracle, I didnapost think Iaposd ever have a child. We had been trying for three and half years, we started trying to before we got married. After a year of trying and not being pregnant, I thought something was wrong so I went to see a doctor. Hollie was diagnosed with PCOS, which causes the oies to enlarge and surrounds eggs with fluid filled sacs, which reduce fertility.  It is thought that while one in five UK women live with PCOS, half of them do not display any symptoms. Although there is currently no cure for PCOS, Manchester-based healthy-eating coach Norah Cozens claims this bizarre diet can tackle the condition.  After starting IVF , Hollie was dealt a further blow when doctors told her that her eggs were not growing inside the incubator. Things changed just days later when doctors contacted her again. I got a bit upset when they said they hadnapost grown, but two days later they rang me up and said aposyour eggs have grown and we can take themapos. Ellia Tomlinson was welcomed in the world by her family including mum Hollie, granddad Richard Stocks, , great-grandmother Susan Stocks, , and great-great-grandmother Eileen Petchey, .  Besotted Hollie said: Sheaposs doing well, sheaposs putting weight on, sheaposs up to lb oz and is keeping me up at night Itaposs surreal, I have been with my partner for seven years and we had our house how we like it. Now, every room has a bit of her in it. Elliaaposs birth now means that five generations of the family are all living at the same time. Hollie was particularly chuffed that her great-great-grandmother could meet Ellia. She said: My great-grandma is so pleased she got to meet her. Being  is a great age, Iaposm really happy that sheaposs still here to see me have my own child. Sheaposs seen me grow up and now she has seen me have a child of my own. Sheaposs smitten with Ellie and she sees a lot of her.  Hollie revealed the miracle news to her family with a Christmas card addressed to Nana and granddad. She said: I put a picture of the embryo and the test in the card and wrote aposIaposll see you in nine months. But she didnapost let us wait nine months, she came six weeks early. Hollie and Christian kept the babyaposs sex as a surprise until the birth, but Hollie revealed she was hoping for one outcome. She said: I think we both secretly wanted to have a little girl, so we were both just so chuffed.

As someone who runs a business and a family household budget, I was gobsmacked with the appalling way Thomas Cook had been driven, especially with , people depending on it for a living. And I know what it’s like to look into the eyes of people who won’t get paid next month. It’s a big responsibility for execs and auditors, whose job it is to keep a beady eye on cashflow and respond to ever-changing markets.  And Thomas Cook CEO Peter Fankhauser was paid millions to stay on top of the travel trends and customer behaviour. The sad fact is that just one in seven of us now pops into a travel agent to buy a holiday. Those who do, tend to be over , with less cash. So it wasn’t even a case of Frankhauser failing to look in the rear-view mirror, the wall of debt and failure was right in front of him, and failing to see it or ignoring it was shameful beyond-belief.

Kimberley Hill, from Birmingham, said she fears she will be forced to give up her job because nursery costs are leaving her with no funds to feed herself, Birmingham Live reports . The -year-old mother of two switched to Universal Credit at the end of June, believing it would be better for her family. The mum from Telford took an advance payment loan of £, to cover her between the period when her benefits stopped and her Universal Credit started. Ms Hill was surprised to learn she was required to get a job, after her youngest son Austin turned three in August, as the looking for work age had reduced from having a child aged five to three.  But undeterred, the single mum started a part time job in logistics admin by September . As a working mother, she should now be entitled to  hours free childcare per week, but she missed the deadline to apply , as she had not been intending toto work before then. Ms Hill now faces monthly outgoings of £ for nursery fees and £ for after-school care for her five-year-old Wyatt, which is more than the £ she is paid each month. Currently, Ms Hill receives £, Universal Credit per month, but this will be reduced signicantly when she starts receiving her monthly salary. She says that, after a £ allowance, her payment will reduce by p for every pound she earns. In total, Ms Hillaposs monthly outgoings come to £,..    Ms Hill said: I’m so saddened they expect me toto work and are so eager for me to do so and, when I have found something, I have no support whatsoever,” said Kimberley, from Telford. “My salary doesn’t even cover my childcare costs let alone any other bills. I cannot afford to pay for my childcare upfront.Working parent recipients of Universal Credit are entitled to claim up to % of their childcare costs, but the bills must be paid upfront by the parents and then reclaimed. But Kimberley says she is unable to do this as her rent needs to be paid upfront and her salary and Universal Credit are both paid in arrears. The cash-strapped mum has been in and out of hospital for digestive problems that doctors have diagnosed as a result of her poor diet and the lack of healthy food she eats. She said: I feed the kids then I have whatever’s left over. Healthy food is expensive, cheap food isn’t so much. The doctors say I’m not getting enough fruit and veg but I cannot comprehend spending much money on a meal. All I can afford is £ pizza and £ chips.    But the mother had truly thought Universal Credit was the best option for her family. She said: I switched to Universal Credit because I was struggling to save my weekly income support benefits to pay my monthly bills,”  said Kimberley, who says her mum and dad help her out when they can but that she doesnapost like to ask them. “I felt this decision would be best for me and my boys as Universal Credit is paid monthly. The first payment takes four to five weeks to come through but your benefits stop straight away.  I had to try to find money for new unorm and shoes. I cannot get a credit card, overdraft or loans because of a debt relief order. I’ve had to call on a neighbour to borrow some money to pay my car insurance. Sometimes I wish I hadn’t come off income support because at least I had my bills paid. But it was hardI needed a new tyre on my car or my son got a hole in his school jumper. Itaposs confusing because the amount of Universal Credit I get changes every month depending on how much childcare Iaposm claiming and how much money Iaposm earning. But it feels like I get a lot less money now. Her working schedule means that the working mum is required to pay for a full dayaposs nursery fee even though she only works between pm and pm. Until her claim to  hours a week of free childcare is increased in January, Ms Hill is only able to claim  hours per week now. The mother of two said: No wonder some people choose to just pop another child out, probably an easier option because it’s so much stress, but thataposs having a child for the wrong reasons. I didn’t expect to be a single mum. I had been with my partner for years but it didn’t work out.    Work coaches at Jobcentres are able to offer eligible claimants a Flexible Support Fund, which is a non-repayable award to help with upfront childcare costs in order to start work. Ms Hill applied for this but was told she would likely be denied as the amount she needed was so high. She said: I’m not looking for money I can blow on me, I’m just trying to do better for me and my kids. I don’t even knowI can cope with the stress or worry. I’m just taking it a day at a time and praying I get accepted for the Flexible Support Fund to tide me over. If I don’t then Iaposll have to quit my job and they will chase me to search for a new one. It will be a never ending circle. The Department for Work and Pensions team has said their team is looking into Ms Hillaposs case and have agreed to offer her help from the Flexible Support Fund. A Government spokesperson said:  We’re committed to helping everyone access the support they need. Up-front care costs can be claimed out of the Flexible Support Fund and Ms Hill’s claim has been allowed. With Universal Credit, working parents can recover up to  per cent of eligible childcare costs. Ms Hill has also applied for up to  hours free childcare to begin in January, and advice for families about when to claim is available online.

A meeting held by union bosses saw hundreds of devastated former employees speak about their financial woes after finding out they were unlikely to be paid their wages on Monday which is their pay day. According to the Daily Mail, some workers said they have had to use charity food vouchers and were relying on financial help from friends and family since they lost their jobs. The collapse of the -year-old travel firm on Monday left , workers without jobs and , Brits stranded abroad.    The government is flying back holidaymakers in the largest peacetime repatriation and will launch an inquiry into the company’s management. It comes after it emerged directors including chief executive Peter Fankhauser collectively took a £million pay packet. That included £m in bonuses despite plummeting profits. Cabin manager Laura Tremarco, , who had worked at Thomas Cook since she was , said she met Mr Fankhauser at an event several years ago saying aposhe seemed like a nice guyapos. She added: Little did we know he and the rest of them were taking these massive wages.    It is disgusting, she continued. I was supposed to get paid around £, with commission on Monday, but we’re not getting any of that. I feel so angry and sad. Part-time air hostess Betty Knight, , who has worked in the industry for almost  years, said she was heartbroken. It’s a worrying time, she added. Thomas Cook is made up predominantly of women and it is the single mothers I really feel for. It will hit so many of them so hard.’  We had pay freezes and everything down to the last paperclip was accounted for. There should be an inquiry – it stinks. For Danny Cossar, , this is a second blow. He previously worked for Monarch Airlines, which collapsed in . Danny, from Manchester, was among cabin crew and holidaymakers “held hostage” at a Cuban hotel when Thomas Cook went under owing it money. He said: “They are the best people in the industry, with such passion for their customers.”  Cabin crew manager Janet Thorpe also suffered a double blow. She was on a family break through the firm in Orlando, Florida, and learned on the day of the collapse the hotel had taken £ from her account. The -year-old, from Chorley, Lancs, said: “I rang them and they said it was because Thomas Cook hadn’t paid them and I was liable.” She is still coming to terms with losing her job, adding: “I can’t imagine myself doing anything . The last time I did a job interview was in .”  Mike Gaskell from United said: We’ve seen film star wages being taken out of a business for what ultimately was failure. People have a right to be angry. However a lawyer said that employees were in a complex legal situation and another said litigation would be expensive. James Froud, who works at law firm McCarthy Denning, said: News that Thomas Cook employees are planning legal action after losing their jobs may have buoyed some - but sadly the news is not particularly good for them. The legal position for employees in the context of their employer becoming insolvent is complex.  Whilst they may have rights to claim unfair dismissal, to seek redundancy compensation and a aposprotective awardapos for a failure by the employer to consult with them prior to the dismissal, the value of those claims is restricted - and the way in which these claims are treatedis not generally that favourable. Ross Meadows, who is based at Oury Clark solicitors, said: The employees will have ious claims against the company, including claims for unpaid salary, benefits and notice pay statutory redundancy pay unfair dismissal and a protective award for failing to inform and consult with staff as is required in a collective redundancy situation. Unfortunately, the litigation is expensive and judgment debts are dficult to enforce against insolvent employers. Thomas Cook’s collapse is also prove a massive blow to high streets across the UK as it had around  branches.

And many mimic the trusted logos of much-loved food and drink brands. The makers also know the flavours they promise are exactly what youngsters crave. But these are all vaping liquids for e-cigarettes – enticing kids to risk health issues and potentially develop a nicotine habit. In the US, similar liquids aimed at youngsters have been pulled from the market and banned following  vaping-linked deaths and reports of more than  vaping-related illnesses. Yet the Sunday People found them available to kids in the UK via eBay without age checks – despite sales of the liquids and nicotine being illegal for under-s.    Professor Jonathan Grigg, a paediatrician at Queen Mary University of London, said: “I’m concerned that these liquids could contain dangerous chemicals. “It’s unlikely we know the long term effects of vaping and the reassurance we have from our regulatory bodies may not be backed up by complete evidence. I think there’s a risk that children will find these flavours attractive, and the smell. “Teens trying out vaping will get hooked on the flavours, and become addicted to nicotine. “The widespread advertising and use of flavouring makes me worried. Cigarettes should taste like cigarettes, not like candy.” As a result of our exposé, eBay suspended the sellers’ accounts, saying they had failed to follow rules about age verication.    A Public Health England report earlier this year showed vaping among youngsters had doubled in four years, from eight per cent in  to  per cent in .One in six  to -year-olds had tried e-cigs and many said they liked the flavours. The People’s undercover reporter found a number of eBay sellers in the UK offering fluids that mimic fizzy pop and sweets.Our investigation reveals brands like Candy Crush, Coca-Cola and Krispy Kreme are being illegally exploited to push the products, designed to be mixed with nicotine and then vaped. When we checked we found the Fantango range, with flavours like lemon  lime and apple  blackcurrant, priced at £..One reviewer wrote: “Great juice. Bought it as wanted to seetastes like Fanta.”Another product, at £., had packaging resembling Krispy Kreme, with the name Krusty Kremes. There were also rips-offs of Candy Crush and Oreo. Another liquid copied sweet brand Sour Patch Kids, bragging: “Your favourite American sour candy sweets now in your vape juice.”The products were marketed as “Premium USA” but some are manufactured in Asia.Cola ml liquid, imported from Malaysia, was being sold by a UK company and copies the Coca-Cola branding.  All listings promised “age verication checks” but orders were taken without asking for proof of age – and our researcher was told items would be sent by nd class Royal Mail post. Despite sales of e-liquids and nicotine being banned for under-s, we bought vaping liquid with ml nicotine. A concerned mum had posted on an eBay forum: “My -year-old and -year-old both found it very easy to buy their vape supplies on eBay. Apparently, eBay does not care about age policies.” We phoned the seller behind one and they claimed to check ages using something called  age verication, which eBay was unfamilar with.England’s chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, has warned that the issue of children vaping could be “a ticking time bomb”.  And our findings come the same week as the boss of Juul, the largest vaping firm in the US, was forced to step down. It was accused of targeting e-cigs at kids and was hit by reports of hundreds of cases of seemingly vaping-related illness. For years, Juul promoted its e-cigs as a safer alternative to traditional tobacco.But the Food and Drug Administration recently warned it against making health claims without presenting scientic ­evidence for approval. President Donald Trump said he is banning flavoured vaping liquids amid fears of an epidemic among teenagers. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the US puts the vaping death toll at  so far but says the specic substance causing illness has yet to be identied. Most patients have said they vaped products containing THC, the ingredient that produces a high in marijuana, while others said they vaped only nicotine.The long-term effects of vaping are not yet known and US health officials are advising people not to use vaping products until the cause is better understood.An explosion of pulmonary illness cases is thought to be linked to tainted vaping refill cartridges from the black market.

Olivia, now  months old, and her mother, Brittany, , were playing on Michelleaposs kitchen floor when the dog, which has now been put down, attacked Olivia aposout of nowhereapos. The traumatised tot needed reconstructive surgery after her right ear was nearly ripped off. The pet tried to put her whole head in his mouth and now has permanent scars on her face.

All that was going through my mind was, aposshe is not dying in my kitchenapos. There was so much blood, I thought she was going to bleed out. I grabbed her from Brittany and took her to the bathroom to stop the bleeding. Full time mum Brittany, has three children with chemical plant worker husband, Taylor, , including Mason, three, and Madison, two months but was eight months pregnant with Maddison when she was forced to step in to save Olivia.  Olivia was kept in hospital for two days while she underwent a one hour surgery to reattach the tip of her right ear and a two hour skin graft on the top of her head but has been left with permanent scars on her face. Brittany hopes that Olivia canapost remember what happened that day but said the youngster is now wary and cautious around other dogs and sometimes wakes up in the night grabbing her ear. Harvey, who is believed to have been abused by his previous owners, was taken into quarantine for  days by animal control before being put down. Brittany said: We were supposed to be going home but my Mason wanted to see his grandmother. It started off normal. I usually tell the dogs to go awaythey approach us but he was been calm.

David Cunningham, , was told he would not make it to  unless he changed his unhealthy lestyle. David, from Galway, Ireland, would eat  takeaways a week while working nights in a casino, and at his heaviest weighed  stone. He was given the crucial advice after suffering a back injury. David told RSVP Live: “I used to play American football with the Galway team and I hurt my back. I didn’t realise how bad it was at the time, but I damaged two discs and I couldn’t walk.I was on crutches for about six months.”    While waiting for an appointment for surgery, David’s doctor told him he probably wouldn’t survive the operation due to his size, and he also wouldn’t be able to fit in the machine for an MRI scan. “I was  at the time and the doctor told me ‘ you keep going the way you are, you won’t see . Your body can’t take the pressure you’re putting on it’,” David says. “Literally that day I walked out and got in a taxi and decided there and then I was going to do something about it.”After years of leading an unhealthy lestyle, this was what David needed to hear to kickstart his weight loss.    The next day, he contacted personal trainer Paul Dermody and asked would he be willing to work with him as soon as he no longer needed crutches. David tells us: “Without him, I wouldn’t have done it. At the time I didn’t have any self belief and I needed someone to inspire me.” Through Paul’s encouragement, David’s le began to change for the better. Slowly but surely, he began attending the gym up to four times a week and would aim to walk , steps a day. In terms of diet, David says he now eats much healthier, however he will treat himself to the odd takeawayhe wants to.  He says when he started to lose weight, “I still ate everything I wanted, just a lot less of it. “My diet when I worked in the casino was terrible, I’d probably eat about seven to ten takeaways a week. So at the start I cut down from ten takeaways a week to about four - I didn’t eliminate all the bad stuff straight away because I wouldn’t have had the willpower to do that. “Cutting out two pizzas and four McDonald’s a week to just brown rice and vegetables wasn’t going to happen.

He has looked asit has not fazed him.“As a coaching staff, you do want goals to be spread around the team and that will mean centre-halves having to convert set-plays, midfielders to chip in and wingers to be nipping in at the back post to score.“In an ideal world you would like that and we had that in the Dundee derby. That was the perfect scenario so, hopefully, we can get back to that.“I don’t think, however, that we can take anything away from Lawrence and play down how good he has been considering every new singing is a gamble.“He has been perfect for us so far.”Former Rangers, Wigan and Motherwell forward Lee also heaped praise on young striker Louis Appere for his performances to date.And the former Killie gaffer believes the -year-old is already a better player than he was at that age.“I think he is a wee bit better than me, to be honest,” Lee added. “I would say that, especially at the age he is at.“I am a big fan of Louis.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world.

The centre was inspired by Catherine and her husband John after their experiences when John contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome.#I thought the notion of collecting crisp packets was brilliant, said Catherine, so I mentioned it to Michael one day.##Catherine suggested the crisp packet idea to me one day when I was in the Salty Dog Cafe,# explained Michael.After discussing it with teachers it was all systems go. Head girl Eilidh Logan designed snazzy posters to go around the school and the bags poured in.Michael concluded: #Collecting crisp bags is just so easy to do, and we are supporting recycling, prevention of littering and charity benefits too.#If you want to donate crisp bags, there are a number of collection points around Mid Argyll.

have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main

Police Scotland does not make any financial contribution to the town centre schemes.ldquoThe councilrsquos current position with regard to CCTV provision is not to install new CCTV equipment or replace le-expired systems but to continue to maintain the current asset within the existing revenue budget until they are beyond economic repair.ldquoFor information, previous work undertaken by officers in  indicated that the likely total capital cost of replacement, on a like for like basis, while utilising more modern digital technologies, could be in the region of circa pound,.ldquoThere would be potentially additional costs associated with related civils works and infrastructure in the region of pound,.ldquoA follow up report could update and validate this figure to present-day costs, however given the anticipated capital expenditure of circa poundm, plus a requirement for future on-going enhanced revenue expenditure, officers do not believe that this will provide value for money.ldquoIn addition, there is currently no identied budget, either capital or revenue.However, at a full council meeting in May, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell put forward a motion calling on officers to explore options for keeping the CCTV network, and officers have suggested a public consultation be held.The motion was agreed, and so the council will consult with ious stakeholders in the CCTV network, including Police Scotland, community councils and area partnerships, as well as providers of CCTV network systems and infrastructure to determine potential costs.The consultation will then form the basis of a series of options for CCTV in the Borders which councillors will be asked to approve, most likely in December.The councilrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon Edgar, said: ldquoWe know that CCTV can be a useful tool for the police and communities in terms of public safety.ldquoHowever, we also know that in order for the cameras to contribute to creating safe environments in our towns, the technology needs to be kept up-to-date.ldquoWith a growing demand for our services, and budget constraints, the Council must consider whether replacing the current system is value for money, and what other options are available.ldquoIn order for the council to make a fully informed decision, we need the views of the public and would encourage residents, businesses and community groups to take part in our consultation before the October  deadline.The survey is available at scotborders.citizenspace"},{"url":null,"title":"dream-wedding-dashed-thomas-cook-goes-bust","story":"A PEEBLES couple have had their dream wedding in Turkey shattered by the collapse of Thomas Cook.Groom Kevin Weir and his bride Kirsteen Barrett forked out pound, to fly their  guests to celebrate their wedding in the sun.But with only two weeks to go until they jetted off to say their vows, news that the travel firm had gone bust wrecked their plans.The distraught couplersquos wedding is now in ruins and they fear it could take months before they see a penny of their money refunded.Bride-to-be Kirsteen told us she broke down after hearing news that the travel operator had gone into liquidation this week.ldquoI just couldnrsquot believe it.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"farmer told to be of good behaviour","story":"Fergus Wilkie, , of Crossibeg Farm, had previously admitted engaging in behaviour which caused a woman fear and alarm by loitering and following her outside her place of work and in a supermarket.

Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us.

I walked through woods to primary school.The committee approved the conditions with an added condition which called for the developer to produce details of a footpath link to the south of the strip of land owned by Muirfield Grove residents for approval before building begins.It also added an additional condition asking for a Construction Method Statement to be submitted prior to work beginning amid concerns about access to the site which is through a narrow C-class road and reports of heavy construction vehicles parking off site.A third additional condition, addressing the local

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

It would be a pity to lose part of our local heritage.ldquoI feel that it is wrong to disregard the name Blindwells due to the amount of local history attached to the name.Councillor Lachlan Bruce added: ldquoI think itrsquos important that the students have as much freedom as they want when thinking about what to call the new town and that should include Blindwellsthey want to suggest that.Work on building the first homes at Blindwells could get under way at the beginning of next year.More than , houses ndash as well as a school and ious community facilities ndash have the go-ahead, with many more homes expected in the future."},{"url":null,"title":"pub-hairdressers-prestonpans-broken-night","story":"The first incident happened at am on Wednesday at the Railway Tavern on High Street, where damage was caused but nothing was stolen.Police are also investigating a break-in at the nearby  Hairdressers, which took place at about.am.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/2565902.jpg?type=article-full","title":"dominic-cummings-talks-loopholes-bypass-law-preventing-no-deal-brexit","story":"Dominic Cummings, the Prime Ministers senior adviser says that lawyers are arguing over the Benn Act, which demands that the government asks the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline.It comes as former Prime Minister John Major launched an attack on Boris Johnson - accusing him of having plans to exploit a loophole to bypass the law which forces the government to go for an extension to the October  deadlinethere is no exit deal.Mr Major said the government will use a piece of legal \"chicanery\" to by pass the bill, using the secretive body of the Privy Council to get around the law.:John Bercow promises \"creativity\" to stop forced no-dealBrexit\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit negotiations are a walk in the park, claims Dominic Cummings\",\"description\": \"Brexit negotiations are a walk in the park, claims Dominic Cummings\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media nKDYKeF poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests nKDYKeF.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Mr Cummings said last night:\"There are obviously loopholes here, because Remain lawyers are all babbling away on Twitter about the loopholes, so they say themselves that there are loopholes.\"Asked by Sky Newsthe government would obey the law, he said: \"All governments obey the law, or they try to.He said he and the prime minister are \"enjoying\" the pressure of Brexit negotiations.He said: \"We are not under pressure, the referendum was pressure.

But therersquos been a war of words doon in yonder Hoose orsquo Commons, and I have little to say about it beyond the following cogent and authoritative ndash be quiet, madam ndash observations.The stooshie ndash guid Scots word ndash thither was occasioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnsonreferring to a ldquoSurrender Act, vis-a-vis obstructive Remain legislation.The word ldquoRemain is your first clue that the subject is Brexit, and I intend dropping it as swtly as possible. In a nutshell , a referendum occurred in which one side was entirely ignorant about EU matters, did not even know who their MEP was , did not know which body sat in Brussels and which in Strasbourg, and did not know there would have to be multiple deals. And there was another side which voted to Leave.For better or worse, richer or poorer, the Leavers won, occasioning paroxysms of fury among the bourgeois elite, which pushed through the aforementioned legislation to protect our democracy from the voters.Irsquove read the words ldquoSurrender Act forwards. And, liking to be thorough, Irsquove read them backwards. And Irsquom at a loss to see how theyrsquore violent or threatening, as alleged by the opposition. There are connotations of wartime perhaps, though not necessarily so , but it still seems a relatively harmless rhetorical device, issued in the face of a clamour of abuse ndash ldquofascist! ldquodictator! the usual products of careful analysis ndash from hate-fill generaled faces on the benches opposite.I think ldquobetrayal was also used, but there can hardly be a week in which it isnrsquot trotted out. In fact, itrsquos one of the most routinely deployed accusations in politics.As for violent, threatening language, the opposition walked right into a trap as Borisrsquos defenders brought up numerous horrendous examples of Labour members or supporters in particular talking of ldquolynching the b**ch , being admittedly ldquofull of hate, giving someone ldquoa good slapping, ldquogarrotting Danny Alexander, wanting to go back in time and ldquoassassinate Margaret Thatcher, ldquosurrendering the NHS to the US and, of course, calling everybody a Nazi.It was left to that nice man, Jeremy Corbyn , to point out that neither side had a monopoly on virtue.Fortunately, the Commons has no monopoly on Mr Johnsonrsquos time, and it was the prorogue elephantrsquos trumpeted words where that attracted my attention. In New York, for example, he made Iranrsquos President Hassan Rouhani titter by inviting him to a climate change summit in Scotland, saying: ldquoAs you know, Glasgow is lovely in November. Outrageous!Also in the US, he complained about tarfs on socks, averring that ldquosome fibres hellip have to be taken to a laboratory and set fire to twice. Incendiary stuff. On brassicas, he complained that ldquoonly certain ports in the United States are licensed for the import of British caullowers. Lucky United States.At the UN General Assembly, bewildered delegates looked nervously at each other, wonderingthey were supposed to laugh, when the PM compared performing in Parliament to Prometheus having his liver pecked out daily by an eagle. Well, itrsquos arguable, I suppose.Further adventures with words included describing some urban environments as being ldquoas antiseptic as a Zurich pharmacy, and taking the pisces out of the SNP administration in Scotland by calling it ldquofish-abandoning.However, the prize for clever deployment of words goes to the busty blonde tech entrepreneur and ex-model, with a pole-dancing pole in her flat, who described Mr Johnsonrsquos weekly visits as being for ldquotechnology lessons.Technology lessons is sure to replace ldquoUgandan relations at Private Eye as a euphemism for activities of a lewd and libidinous nature.Words, words, words.

But the men appealed to Congress for assistance, saying they had acted in good faith and a law was ultimately passed in the US to protect whistleblowers, approved in . It is referred to as the ldquoworldrsquos first whistleblower protection law.Now itrsquos back in the spotlight The complaint that has potential to topple Mr Trump accuses the President of ldquousing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the US  election.It relates to a telephone call he had with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on July , during which Mr Trump allegedly pressed his counterpart to investigate political rival, Joe Biden.The whistleblowerrsquos identity is secret It remains so and a lawyer acting for the person has warned that trying to identy them could place them ldquoin harmrsquos way. But it has been reported they were a CIA officer.What  did the whistleblower say They were concerned that the transcript of the telephone call was not stored in the usual computer system, but was instead stored separately in a classied information file.The most famous whistleblower Has to be ldquoDeep Throat, the source for the Washington Posts Watergate scandal in the s that brought down President Richard Nixon.

Canrsquot have better testimony than that!"},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-last-upside-brexit-labour-rediscovered-soul","story":"These were once sharply-defined points on Britainrsquos political landscape by which you could set your moral compass. Then the age of Margaret Thatcher dawned and with it the worship of consumerism where a fire-sale of British assets lasting three decades created a new class of millionaires and Tory party donors. Thus, getting rich quickly and easily was regarded as a virtue and ordinary people denied the access codes saw the lights go out in their communities.The Labour Party, which had once championed these neighbourhoods, simply gave up the ghost, retiring wounded from the eternal fray after seeing the  election slip from their grasp when it had seemed theirs for the taking. This reversal was the most grievous cut of all as it seemed to signal that its own people had become mesmerised and duped by the bribes of right-to-buy and a few hundred quid from Sid at British Gas.Capitalism had won and there seemed nothing  for it but to fall in behind and loosen the bonds of Clause IV and the dreams of making the profits of industry flow to the many and not the few. The Labour party, primped up and gentried under Tony Blair was a wretched facsimile of the movement which brought the British people homes fit for habitation, free healthcare and access to university education. This one was all about appeasing high finance and the banks by withdrawing scrutiny of their misdeeds and quietly permitting Mrs Thatcherrsquos anti-trade union measures to ride.Socialism, long reviled by the right for giving the masses a glimpse of something glorious, became something pernicious and anti-patriotic once more under Mr Blair and his acolytes whose guiding principles were cashed in for a portfolio of city non-execs and the brush of ermine.In Parliament this week the left, glimpsing perhaps the downfall of a sitting Tory Prime Minister, made a graven idol of an elderly lady with a spider brooch. Later they rose up in righteous fury because Boris Johnson used words like lsquosurrenderrsquo and lsquohumbugrsquo to dismiss calls that he apologise for unlawfully proroguing parliament.This would have comforted a Tory regime which has overseen a one-sided austerity experiment a hostile environment for immigrants and refugees and tax cuts for the UKrsquos most affluent citizens and corporations. Across the UK and especially in its poorest communities thousands of families continue to suffer the effects of Mrs Thatcherrsquos social engineering.Yet here was the left being side-tracked once more, this time by the mere sounds of right-wing contempt. In future, they may come to regret that this contrived outrage at robust and plain speech from the Conservatives may undermine any attempts to express their own justiable anger over Tory attacks on the people they purport to represent.The confetti of their outrage, conveniently for the Tories, masked the messages coming out of the most important Labour Party conference in generations. At Brighton this week the party delivered several crucial policy statements that signalled to its wider membership that delivering for the many and not the few is more than just a slogan.The move to reclaim an authentic Clause IV, the momentous declaration that gives this movement its entire moral purpose, was long overdue. Before the advent of Thatcherism and the concept of profit-before-people, Clause IV was regarded as a reasonable aspiration for working class people who had been forbidden to share in the profits of their labour.ldquoTo secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service.This was a challenge to inequality and thus came to be hated by a Tory party that has always thrived on greed and corruption. Thereafter, they relied on the owners of Britainrsquos mass circulation newspapers ndash their former chums at Eton and Oxford ndash to treat this message like a contagion.The Labour conference also pledged to dismantle the UKrsquos private school system, the principal means by which its advocates ensure that fairness is always kept at a safe distance and that unearned wealth will always triumph over hard work and natural ability. Their adoption of a suite of SNP measures to help our most vulnerable citizens and already embedded in Scotlandrsquos social contracts simply underpinned theto its most sacred values.Therersquos a perverse reassurance to be had in observing the behaviour of Boris Johnson at this point when Labour has re-discovered its soul. The Prime Minister has been rebuked by some on his own side for fostering an extreme form of Toryism by casting overboard those who refuse to give him total fealty. He believes himself above the law and treats the UKrsquos democratic institutions with contempt. Accusations of corruption and conflicts of interest seem to embolden him.This has always been the Tory way this is their Clause IV: ldquoto deny the workers the full fruits of their industry and by any means necessary ndash legal or illegal ndash exerting control over each industry or service. What party did these lsquomoderatersquo Tories think they were signing up for  Just as Jeremy Corbyn is re-acquainting Labour with its core values so Mr Johnson is embracing once more the most cherished principles of Conservatism. For the first time in a generation our two main parties are playing the roles originally assigned to them by the constituencies they were sworn to protect. Let honest battle now commence.Brexit must and will happen because a clear majority of English voters committed themselves to it in a clearly-defined campaign. This also offers a stark reminder to Scots that on the most serious issues affecting their future their votes simply do not matter under our current constitutional arrangements."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-labours-priority-blocking-no-deal-brexit-not-pressing-general-election","story":"A senior SNP MP said the opposition parties could stage a vote of no-confidence in the Government as early as next week in a bid to oust Boris Johnson.It follows talks at Westminster by party leaders aimed at thwarting any attempt by the Prime Minister to push through a no-deal break on October  against the will of Parliament.Speaking to reporters at a rally in Chingford, Essex, Mr Corbyn said he stood ready to lead an interim governmentMr Johnson was forced from No .:Kevin McKenna: At last, an upside of Brexit: Labour has rediscovered its soulHowever he said his first priority was to ensure the Prime Minister complied with the so-called Benn Act which requires him to seek a further Brexit delayhe cannot get a new deal with the EU.ldquoOur priority, all of us, is to prevent a no-deal exit from the European Union on the st, he said.ldquoAt that point, wersquore ready for an election. But the priority is to prevent a no-deal exit, with all the problems this could cause the people of this country.Former chancellor Philip Hammond accused the Prime Minister of failing to negotiate seriously with the EU while the speculators who backed him stood to make a killing inthe event of no-deal.ldquoAs his sister has reminded us, he is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexitndash and there is only one outcome that works for them: a crash-out no-deal Brexit that sends the currency tumbling and inflation soaring, he wrote in an article for The Times.ldquoSo they, at least, will be reassured to see no evidence at all that his government has seriously pursued a deliverable deal still less that it has been pursuing a deal that could get us out by October .Meanwhile the SNP MP Stewart Hosie said that a no-confidence vote might be the only way to stop no-deal.ldquoWe have to do that because there is now no confidence that the Prime Minister will obey the law and seek the extension that Parliament voted for only a few weeks ago, he told the BBC Radio  Today programme.ldquoIf we are serious about the extension, that is the only game in town.So far, opposition leaders have been wary of tabling a confidence vote, fearing Mr Johnson could,he is defeated, simply delay a general election until after October  by which time Britain will be out of the EU.Mr Hosie acknowledgedthe plan could only workan alternative government capable of commanding a Commons majority had been ldquopre-agreed before the vote.However the Liberal Democrats, as well as rebel Tories who had the whip withdrawn, have made clear they that they are not prepared to see Mr Corbyn enter No  as Prime Minister.However Mr Hosie said it was ldquoself-evidently the case that as the leader of the second largest party Westminster, Mr Corbyn should have the first chance of forming an administration.ldquoIf Jo Swinson and the Lib Dems are actually serious about their stopping Brexit position then they need to stop playing political games, get on board with everybody , he said.ldquoAll of the opposition parties and the Tory rebels need to be on board with a single plan.:Boris Johnson could face no-confidence voteldquoIf that is not in place and effectively pre-agreed, then we might end up having the general election on Boris Johnsonrsquos terms, allowing him to run down the clock and crash out without a deal.Mr Corbyn confirmed that in such an event, he would expect to be given the first crack at forming a government with the sole purpose of seeking a Brexit extension and then holding a general election.ldquoThe normal process is that when a government collapses, the leader of the opposition is invited to form a minority government in order to carry through a specic and strictly limited process which would be to ensure no crash-out and to prepare for a general election, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"food waste really can power cars like in the 1980s back to the future movies","story":"Just as Marty McFly and the Doc discovered in Back to the Future, our food waste can be transformed into a sustainable fuel to power future energy needs.So environmental organisation Zero Waste Scotland is using this year’s Recycle Weekto raise awareness of the potential energy that can be captured by simply placing peelings, egg shells, tea bags and any uneaten produce in household food recycling caddies.The time travelling DeLorean used in the classic s movies was modied to run on food waste – and the technology now exists to use it today to power vehicles, heat our homes and grow more food.Estimates from Zero Waste Scotland reveal that , tonnes of global warming CO equivalent gas would be saved from entering the environmenteveryone in Scotland with access to a food caddy recycled their tea bags. Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carlukegazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Wallace Day  Aug\"  Braveheart spiritlives on in Lanark viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station. The proposed closure will have a disproportionate impact on our constituents, many of whom are not able to carry around large bags and suitcases, while they wait for their ferry or train to depart.“Even at this late stage, we hope Abellio will agree to review this decision and take steps to minimise any impact on islanders.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So when they retire the feeling of sadness is akin to a death in the family.John Humphrys of the Today programme was the irascible uncle, the kind who at dinner would be very likely to start an argument while grace was being said – but first thing in the morning his rigour and tenacity as he, metaphorically at least, pinned an evasive politician under the wheels of the radio van until the poor sap answered the question would set me up for the challenges of the day.: Jackie Bird reveals she has quit Reporting ScotlandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereBut we in Scotland are soon to suffer a loss far more grave. When we bid farewell to this bitter and isive year Jackie Bird won’t be around to point the way towards a hopefully better . Stop all the clocks. Stop them around .pm on  December. Cancel Hogmanay!Bird has fronted BBC Scotland’s Auld Year’s Night shindig since back in the auld century. If Humphrys was the grumpy uncle then she was the whoop-it-up aunt in the sparkly dress, capable of embarrassing you in your teens with slobbery festive-season kisses, but who you’d eventually come to appreciate was a good laugh and crucial to every party.Well, the party’s over. Hogmanay Live is to be revamped – it will probably get a name-change – and won’t be hosted by Bird. Unlike Humphrys who has gone willingly and was granted a long goodbye last week and one final opportunity to rough up David Cameron, Bird had rather hoped to stay involved, despite having quit newsreading duties earlier this year. But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad.

Evenutally, the rotation may become so strongly-focused that a narrow column of violently rotating air forms.

There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/barra-hospital.jpg","title":"consultation events for barra","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineComhairle nan Eilean Siar are to visit Barra next weekfor two consultation events that will help inform a feasibility study into thecreation of a combined school and hospital facility in Castlebay.The proposal caused confusion and anger earlier thisyear, when it was first publicised, as both the comhairle and NHS Western Isleshad already progressed a plan for a new hospital to replace St Brendan’s.

Dr Lisa Ackerley comments “Anything that children put in their mouth should be hygienically cleaned but it is often dficult to get a child to let you wash their favourite teddy, which means they can become very dirty.

I did Educating Rita at the Lyric and it felt right to perform Shirley here as well.“I was waiting to get to that right age in my career and we went into rehearsals in May. There is something about Willy Russell’s work that relates to me and to Belfast I think the humour translates exactly the same. Both Rita and Shirley have similarities, they are characters who want more,” she said.The Fall and In The Line of Duty actress said the play still has resonance today despite being written more than  years ago.“For many generations women have been told their place. Here is a woman that says ‘well this is what I want and I want to do it dferently’.”Tara spoke of how she “couldn’t wait” to work with acclaimed Tinderbox Artistic Director Patrick J O’Reilly on the production.“I knew he would bring such physicality to the piece, I never wanted it to be me playing lots of dferent people, it has to be Shirley. Patrick’s take on plays is always a little bit to the left so I couldn’t wait to see how left he would go and boy did he go left,” she laughed.“Right from the off Patrick and set and lighting designer Paul Keogan wanted the set to symbolise many things. It opens in Shirley’s kitchen, it’s stark, it’s white, it’s almost asylum like. Shirley keeps it so clean so the symbolism of her writing ‘Greece’ in huge colourful letters on a pristine white kitchen is a really beautul concept that Patrick and Paul came up with.”She continued: “When Act Two opens and Shirley is in Greece, she hasn’t completely left her le behind, she’s only gone to Greece for a fortnight. Her surroundings have changed but there are remnants of her le back home still on the stage. Because you change scene doesn’t mean you have changed, that change has to come from you and I loved that premise.“At the end of the show, her husband Joe is coming over to see her and she is excited by that. Willy Russell doesn’t knowthey are getting back together but they are meeting up. The character of Shirley doesn’t blame Joe for anything that has happened – or didn’t happen in her le. They were both these hopeful people when they married and somewhere along the way le got in the way, everyone in a couple can relate to that.”The former St Genevieve’s High School student does not wear a mic during performances, which helps herbe “intimate with the whole theatre”.“The character of Shirley is a gt, I always knew she was and I think there’s a Shirley in everyone. People seem to instantly connect and understand her and that make it really lovely because then it’s just a conversation I’m having with  people a night. It’s a conversation about le, the script is poignant, it’s sad but ultimately uplting for everyone.”Shirley Valentine runs at The Lyric Theatre until October .

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"28k for woman sacked by northern ireland firm for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I was very worried that the stress could cause complications or even a miscarriage.\"We were in a very bad situation for a time and it is a great relief to me to have this all finished.\"Ms Gruzdaites case was supported by the Equality Commission. She added: \"I am very grateful to the Equality Commission for helping me.\"No woman should lose her job because she is pregnant and it is important that women challenge such treatment.\"Ms Gruzdaite and her husband Andrius Jasinevicius started work at McGrane Nurseries Ltd, a wholesale suppliers of plants, in January , and were given a blank contract to sign with no start or end dates.She believed she was coming to Northern Ireland for a permanent job but at no point was she told it was to be a seasonal job.When she announced her pregnancy and showed the appointment letter for her first antenatal appointment to one of her managers on September , , he forgot to tell the other manager about it.Ms Gruzdaite was called to a meeting on September  with both managers to explain why she had not been at work.She also told a manager on October  about a later scan appointment on October , and she was called in to a meeting about her absence on October .The tribunal found that she was unjustiably questioned about her absence on September  and October  when she had told her manager that she was off for antenatal appointments.The employer accepted that they failed to pay Ms Gruzdaite for her time off attending the antenatal appointments.The tribunal found that a manager was less friendly to Ms Gruzdaite after she announced her pregnancy.On October , while she and her husband were at that antenatal appointment, their employers held a meeting at which a group of seasonal workers were given one weeks notice of termination.The couple were subsequently called in to meet with their employers on October  and were informed of their dismissal.Other seasonal workers were kept on by the employer and carried out the duties previously performed by Laura.On that day, her manager said to her: \"You will need more days off for your pregnancy doctors appointment... you already skipped work on Wednesday when you had your ultrasound scan.\"At tribunal, Ms Gruzdaite said: \"On that day I got very upset because both of our contracts had been terminated.\"We were waiting for our child to come into this world but both of us were unemployed and had no additional income.\"When I ed to my place of work following this conversation, I felt nauseous, my hands were shaking, and I felt a dull pain and a stretching sensation in my stomach.\"The tribunal concluded the decision to terminate Ms Gruzdaites contract was tainted by discrimination in that it was connected to her pregnancy.Her dismissal was both unfair and an act of unlawful discrimination, it ruled.Dr Michael Wardlow, the chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said around a quarter of all the complaints of discrimination made to its advice line each year are to do with sex discrimination.Of those, consistently the largest number, around % of the total, are about pregnancy and maternity discrimination.Mr Wardlow said: \"It is dispiriting that we are at tribunal once again supporting another case of pregnancy discrimination.\"Im afraid this is still all too common and, in spite of the legislation being in place for more than  years, some employers still seem to be unaware of the law and the consequences of breaching it.\"Laura Gruzdaite was  weeks pregnant at the time she and her husband were dismissed.\"They had arrived in Northern Ireland ready and willing to work and have started to make their le here.\"Lauras husband has since found other work and she is caring for their baby.\"A spokesperson for McGrane Nurseries said: \"We acknowledge the findings of the Equality Commission.\"We have engaged the services of a professional HR company who are assisting us in implementing a series of policies and practices to ensure we meet the highest standards in relation to the issues highlighted in the judgment of this case.\"This situation should never have occurred. We apologise to Laura for the upset caused to both her and her family and hope that this ruling will allow them to move forward.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38538473.ece/e76dc/BINARY/lia%20Cruise%20Ship%206.jpg","title":"belfasts biggest visitor megaship msc meraviglia thats the weight of four titanics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"global climate strike wonderful thing see new generation rise","story":"Young people took to the streets of Derry over the weekend to demand action against climate change.Hundreds of Derry students left school on Friday as part of a global climate strike to sound the alarm about what is widely viewed as an “environmental emergency”.And again on Saturday, young people were at the centre of the Our Earth Our Future March, Rally and Gathering which retraced the original civil rights route from the Waterside to the Guildhall.At Friday’s climate strike, one organiser, Rois Hutton, told the crowd they must target political parties and people with influence to insist upon \"radical quick changes\" so that \"we can ensure the survival of the human race.”Another of those behind the strike action, Emma Farren, said that this strike dfered from those held on previous occasions because adults had taken a stand alongside the youth of the city.She urged those in attendance to continue to stand with them to bring about meaningful change.Their actions prompted veteran civil rights activist, Eamonn McCann, to declare on Saturday that in all his years of campaigning he has never been more \"hopeful\".\"What made me hopeful is the composition of the marches. The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining. Amongst its lyrics: \"Whats more precious than gold \"The land, the sea, the air that we breathe, thats more precious than gold.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the

continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving

shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost

leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pump track wales uks largest split track opens rhayader","story":"Kirsty Williams AM tries her hand on one of the bicycles following the opening oltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtf the Wales Pump Traltspan classtruncate-full-screengtck together with some of the cycling enthusiasts present.

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class.

Several of them would be subjected to severe political pressurethey made a decision to close on Monday.At the outset of the discussion the boardrsquos chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, said he did not wish to open debate on the already widely discussed issue. The allocation of exceptional holidays remained a matter of departmental policy whatever board members might think inidually.Mrs Ethel Smyth said the matter was causing great concern in the area and that she had already condemned Lord Elton for the action he had taken in offering Monday as an exceptional holiday.Only a native lord from England would have made such a mistake. In her view, it might have been quite proper for the Roman Catholic maintained schools take one of their ten optional days holidays to see their spiritual leader of their church.In all but one of the controlled schools in her area good sense had prevailed and those schools would remain open on Monday.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision. But it secured a reprieve as a result of pressure from local politicians, including Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.Contractors are currently hard at work restoring and extending the facility which commands spectacular views over the country park from the front of the building and Strangford Lough from the rear.Cllr Walker, who for many years has been campaigning for more investment in the country park to provide an enhanced range of attractions for visitors, said many people were looking forward to seeing the councilrsquos future vision for Delamont.He said the country park was one of the best of its kind in the province and offered ldquounlimited development potential.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoIt is important that when the vision for the future is unveiled that local people are given an opportunity to study the document and provide comment on it.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and it is important that the local council presses ahead with its own investment plan to make Delamont even better, capitalising on its huge development potential.Delamont currently operates a hugely successful miniature railway, cafe, stunning walks and childrenrsquos adventure playground, but Cllr Walker believes so much more can be done.He added: ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.ldquoSecuring finance to enhance the country park is critical to its future development and I hope others funders will join with the council on this issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Resurfacing.jpg","title":"Resurfacing work set to start in Irish Street  ","story":"WORK to resurface Irish Street in Downpatrick following the completion of a pound, public realm scheme is expected to start imminently.Roads officials have indicated that concerns about the state of a derelict building close to the townrsquos former police base have been addressed, paving the way for resurfacing work to start.It was revealed last month that the project had been delayed due to issues over insurance and that the work could not take place until these are resolved.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he has been told by roads officials that concerns about the derelict building have been ironed out and that resurfacing work will begin.Work on the regeneration project was due to be completed by March, but it was the end of June before contractors finally moved off site, with traders in the area expressing anger about the impact the delayed scheme was having on business.The delay also had a knock-on effect on traffic congestion in other parts of the town as a result of the temporary one-way traffic system in Irish Street.Managed by the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities and Newry Mourne and Down Council, the scheme has resulted in new granite paving, street lighting and street furniture.The delay in completing the public realm work within the anticipated three-month timeframe was blamed on a number of factors, described as ldquounforeseen works issues, that resulted in the loss of construction time and delays in delivering the scheme.Issues which arose included the identication of asbestos piping along both sides of Irish Street which resulted in the works contract being put on hold for eight weeks. In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town. The street has been transformed as a result of signicant investment which was long overdue.Cllr Curran said a new group was formed in July to oversee a pound, scheme to help revitalise shop fronts at Irish Street, with the so-called lsquorevitalisation fundingrsquo provided by the Department for Communities and local authority to help business owners improve the fronts of their respective properties.A working group to steer the project forward has been formed, with traders encouraged to come up with schemes to improve shop fronts.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThis is a timely initiative given what the Irish Street traders had to endure for the first six months of the year. It is also important that whatever schemes come forward that the character of this part of the town is retained.ldquoThere are also plans for an ambitious multi-million pound regeneration initiative via the redevelopment of the townrsquos former police base and a number of adjacent empty buildings.

So, do I belong to the IRA  I did not, never have, am not, and have no intention.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button However, based on his own words in a BBC Spotlight film to be broadcast tonight, those denials were lies.Ryan, who is almost , was the critical link between Libya and the IRA as Colonel Muammar Gaddafi happily supplied guns and explosives to republicans so that they could attack their common enemy, the British.Speaking in the third instalment of Spotlight’s seven-part series on the Troubles, Ryan is explicit about his own role in illegal activities.Spotlight did not state whether Ryan still lives in Ireland nor did it explain why he has now decided to self-incriminate himself as has done.During the interview with the BBC, Ryan praised the Libyan dictator who was killed in an uprising in . He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.\"  \"  Supreme Court rules Boris Johnsons decision to prorogue parliament unlawful\"  \"  Jeff Dudgeon: If even Sir Anthony Hart’s inquiry into Kincora, the most rigorous yet, is not believed then we’re in a world of conspiracy theories Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets.

It doesn’t matter where the conversation begins — it always ends up in the same place.”That process had been clear since the referendum campaign. But any hope that either the passage of time or a new prime minister would see Westminsterto its historical equilibrium has not been realised..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Rather, the isions are becoming more entrenched. Some of the outworkings of that have been almost darkly comical to those familiar with Northern Ireland politics.When Boris Johnson announced a month ago that Parliament would be prorogued for five weeks, Labour shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis said that “the police will have to remove us from the chamber” evoking images of the late Ian Paisley being carried out of Stormont in  after the dissolution of the Prior Assembly.Lewis also said that “we will call on people to take to the streets”, a watered-down version of Paisley’s words the morning after being dragged out of Parliament Buildings when he warned that “there’s only one answer when you leave the ballot box — it’s a show of force” and told journalists that “this could come to hand to hand fighting in every street ... we’re on the verge of civil war”.Ultimately, Lewis voluntarily left the chamber – itself reminiscent of how some of the wilder rhetoric of Ulster’s political leaders was later quietly dropped.This week has seen ferocious linguistic warfare between the two Brexit tribes in Westminster, reflecting the fissure in the country.The Times’ experienced political editor, Francis Elliott, said of Wednesday’s parliamentary exchanges that he “cannot remember hatred being so nakedly expressed by so many and at suchacross the ide”.UTV’s veteran political editor, Ken Reid, recalled the viciousness of Belfast City Hall at the height of the Troubles, saying: “As a young reporter in the s, I watched in amazement as Belfast City Council chamber turned into a bear pit. It was nasty, hateful, threatening and without direction. Last night’s Commons row was strikingly similar. The forthcoming election could be the bitterest ever.”On Thursday night, former BBC Northern Ireland political editor Tom Kelly, who went on to work as Tony Blair’s spokesman in Downing Street, invoked another seminal moment from Northern Ireland’s history. He told The View: “I couldn’t help but be reminded of Terence O’Neill’s old phrase about ‘Ulster stands at the crossroads’. Britain’s at the crossroads...in terms of how it does politics – compromise or confrontation ”Central to Northern Irish politics is the absence of swing voters. There is no discernible cohort of the electorate who might be persuaded to move between unionist and nationalist parties based on their public spending priorities or their health policies or their plans for the education system.Arlene Foster: Brexit referendum result must be respected Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Rather, all the movement has come within the two blocs – where voters move between unionist parties or between nationalist parties – or, especially in recent years, between one of the two main tribes and the smaller centrist parties such as Alliance or the Greens.It is that factor which for decades has, with few exceptions, led to electoral reward for those seen to be robust and has punished those who are seem to be open to compromise.It is also logical for parties to overwhelmingly prioritise speaking to their own core support, rather than reaching out to an electorate which is never going to even consider voting for them.In Great Britain, that now means that the keenest battle for voters is not between Labour and the Conservatives but between the Conservatives and the Brexit Party and between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.Theresa May’s style meant that the logical extent of that truth was not explored during her time in office. But, having won the Brexit referendum in similar circumstances, Boris Johnson –and particularly Dominic Cummings – are sufficiently perceptive to realise that the next election will be won on this ground, and sufficiently ruthless to seem prepared for the revolutionary consequences of such a strategy, something at which more traditional conservatives would baulk.For now, there still are people who just want ato normality and some resolution to the Brexit impasse. But the longer that politics is ided in this way, the deeper the isions are likely to become, pushing more and more people to choose a side, thus electorally incentivising the parties to be less and less willing to compromise.Yet, for all the similarities with Northern Ireland politics, there are obvious and profound dferences. There is no religious dimension to the Brexit-Remain argument and despite the constitutional and economic signicance of EU membership, it is not as existential as the question of the very existence of the country.There are also more deeply embedded institutions in Great Britain which are both a brake on political excess and can be a cohesive force. The prorogation of Parliament for a few weeks was met with incredulity which has never manested itself in Belfast over the absence of Stormont for almost , days.The Queen is overwhelmingly respected and thereforeshe decided to address the nation at a moment of acute peril she would carry authority in a way which would not be possible in Northern Ireland.But there are other dferences which could exacerbate the deepening tribal ide. In Northern Ireland there is both a long and a recent memory of the violence which almost inevitably follows the decisive failure of politics. That can be a brake on both politicians and the public, as witnessed by the apparently renewed public acceptance of compromise in the wake of the murder of the journalist Lyra McKee in April. In England, the civil war is too distant to be a check on political disagreements.There is though some hope from Northern Ireland’s recent past. The most stable period constitutionally has been in the near decade of devolution from  to . Despite perennial crises and tribal disputes, in that time support for the status quo soared to record levels as the number of ideologues reduced in the face of a system which at least gave the appearance of working and addressing everyday needs.In that period the DUP began – at least in word – to reach out to Catholic voters in a way which would have been unthinkable, while Martin McGuinness made radical moves such as respectfully shaking hands with the Queen on multiple occasions.But as events since  have demonstrated, when deep isions are established in politics they are dficult to permanently overcome. Decisions taken for tactical party or personal advantage now could have implications for our entire political system for decades to come.try catch  TrendingThis Wrightbus worker didnt hold back when

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change.

He has no mandate, no majority and no morals. He should resign.I immediately ed to Parliament to hold this appalling PM and Government to account, not only on Brexit but also on all the things that people care about ndash like pensions, benefits, sanctions, health, police, refugees, climate change, international trade, EU citizens, the middle east, fracking, Northern Ireland, sexual violence, child poverty ndash all the things that Johnson saw fit to put on hold to suit his own political ends.As I said in the emergency debate on Prorogation prior to the unlawful suspension of Parliament: ldquoMany constituents have told me they are not interested in the procedures and the chicanery they are interested in their lives, and what dference the proceedings here makes to them.My colleagues and I promised that despite the unlawful and unconstitutional delay to business, we would not be silenced ndash we have not been, and we WILL speak up for our constituents against this undemocratic government.As a Welsh Labour MP I will campaign for Remain in all circumstances.I will not support a Brexit that makes people poorer, less safe, takes away opportunities for our young people, or puts peace in Ireland and Northern Ireland at risk ndash and itrsquos only by co-operation that we can tackle the climate emergency.On that subject, it was wonderful to meet so many passionate young constituents from Penarth and Cardf at the Climate Strike rally outside the Senedd on Friday.They have my complete support! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con1.jpg","title":"us cyber security firm creating  jobs in belfast","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Alastair Hamilton and Alan Naumann A US cyber-security firm is creating  jobs with a new base in Belfast.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
