Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sf s stance on past statements orwellian says taoiseach","story":"Sinn Féin’s Claire Kerrane: ‘We are now in a very, very, very different situation in relation to the conflict that’s there in Ukraine.’ Photograph: Dara MacDónaillThe Sinn Féin’s explanation for the removal of thousands of press statements from its website is “Orwellian”, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.He suggested the material was deleted because the party did not want its past statements on Russia examined.“I would be concerned about it but I think there is a reason why they’re all being taken off, or taken out of, the archives . . . I think Sinn Féin was soft on Russia for the last number of years,” Mr Martin told reporters in Washington on Tuesday.“I mean, Sinn Féin is saying – which is good news – now that they don’t agree with the violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity. But it was violated in 2014 and I recall in the Dáil making those points at the time and the response was somewhat muted from Sinn Féin, to say the least.”Mr Martin said he had read a statement by party leader Mary Lou McDonald indicating “the archives are being changed. Kind of Orwellian, I thought to myself,” he said.Sinn Féin has downplayed removal of more than 50,000 press statements from its website, explaining that the party was tidying up its archive.Amid renewed scrutiny over the party’s past record, Sinn Féin said it did not regret its opposition to the expulsion of a Russian diplomat from Ireland in 2018 after Russian agents poisoned dissident Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England.The party’s welfare spokeswoman, Claire Kerrane, said there was no inconsistency between its position four years ago and now, where it has called for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador Yury Filatov.She also denied that Sinn Féin has “flip-flopped” its position in relation to Russia since the invasion of Ukraine.Conflict“I would not say we regret it,” said Ms Kerrane on Tuesday.“We had our position at the time, it was well known. It was put out there. We are now in a very, very, very different situation in relation to the conflict that’s there in Ukraine, of people being absolutely bombed and killed every single day.“So we have a very firm position in relation to what Russia is doing. This will only be solved by discussions, by getting around the table, that is the only way conflict will be solved,” she added.Following the poisoning, Ireland was one of several European Union countries that expelled diplomats.In the Dáil Ms McDonald criticised the decision of then taoiseach Leo Varadkar to expel a diplomat. Describing it as “a flagrant disregard for Irish neutrality”, the Sinn Féin leader said the decision was based on information from a foreign security intelligence service, which was an unprecedented step. “Essentially, we are being asked to trust Boris Johnson. Dare I say that this might not be the best course of action?” she said.An inquiry by investigative group Bellingcat proved subsequently the two men who poisoned the Skripals were agents with the Russian secret service.In a policy paper on Irish neutrality published afterwards, Sinn Féin renewed its criticism of the expulsions.“The escalation of involvement with EU military structures and the recent expulsion of a Russian diplomat in supposed solidarity with another EU member state under the pretence of common defence and security co-operation . . . shows that this government is prepared to sacrifice our neutrality and independent foreign policy at the altar of European integration unless stopped,” it stated.Different spaceMs Kerrane said: “We did not call for an expulsion at the time. But now we’re in a very different space. It’s a very different situation now.”She said things have changed drastically: “Our position in relation to the situation now was very clear in the midst of this war.”On the removal by Sinn Féin of 52,000 past statements from its website, she added that the press releases were being archived as they were beginning to slow down the site. She said all of those releases were public documents released to the media and were therefore accessible.Ms Kerrane went on to again call on the Government to take action in relation to energy costs, particularly home heating."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to

punishing one despot for starting a war in Europe requires cosying up to another in the Middle East.Mr Johnson says the barbaric actions of Vladimir Putin in invading Ukraine are “testing not just Ukraine but all of humanity” and Britain must respond by moving away from “dependence on Russian oil”.As Britain’s Russian energy boycott contributes to pushing oil prices to record highs at home, the Government says that “demand can be met by alternative suppliers”.So it is with cap in hand that Mr Johnson will fly to Riyadh, one of the few oil producers with the spare capacity to immediately ramp up production, to ask Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to pump more oil to ease prices.While Mr Johnson has condemned Mr Putin for launching an illegal invasion in which Ukrainian civilians have been indiscriminately targeted in their homes, hospitals and schools, he is far more circumspect about Saudi Arabia\u0027s 36-year-old de facto leader, with whom he reportedly corresponds via WhatsApp messenger. Mr Johnson views Riyadh as “a partner”, his spokesman said last week, which means the kingdom’s de facto leader is not subject to the same criticism as Putin.Thus it is not thought Mr Johnson will publicly speak out against the kingdom carrying out the largest mass executions in its history over the weekend. It also puts Mr Johnson at odds with Joe Biden, the US president, who was elected promising to challenge Saudi human rights abuses and hold Prince Mohammed to account for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.British arms sales to Saudi ArabiaLikewise, Saudi Arabia’s disastrous air war in Yemen is not likely to be subject to the same criticism as Putin’s Ukraine invasion.A war more distant and entrenched than Ukraine, Yemen’s seven-year-old conflict is nonetheless described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. It is also fuelled by billions of pounds worth of British arms sales to Saudi Arabia.British-made bombs and planes have been implicated in scores of Saudi strikes that have killed civilians. Over half of the Saudi air force aircraft flying sorties over the country are UK-supplied, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, with some even dropping UK-made cluster munitions on the impoverished country.Saudi Arabia says it is defending itself against Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, which have attacked the kingdom with drones and missile strikes. But its air campaign has faced accusations of indiscriminately targeting civilians, while a blockade of Houthi-controlled areas has contributed to pushing the country to the brink of famine.Rather than pressuring Saudi Arabia to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict, Mr Johnson may be asked to pledge further weapons sales or British support for Riyadh’s security policy towards Yemen and arch-rival Iran, according to Sanam Vakil, deputy director of Chatham House’s Middle East programme.“If there is an agreement over Saudi supply I think the UK could commit to supporting the Saudi position on security issues in the region,” said Ms Vakil. Facing a cost of living crisis at home and a war in Europe that threatens to escalate, Mr Johnson may have to calculate whether that is a price worth paying for Saudi Arabia agreeing to increase oil production.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Ukraine must accept it will never be in Nato, says Volodymyr ZelenskyRussian TV presenter Marina Ovsyannikova who said ‘No’ to war interrogated for 14 hoursInvestigation into reports that three British ex-soldiers killed in Ukraine military base attackThe Queen gets back to work after missing Commonwealth Day serviceTwo journalists killed in Ukraine after vehicle comes under fireThe inside story of what Marina Ovsyannikova’s brave act will mean for Russia’s propaganda warMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris wont return saudi empty handed","story":"There is no G7 leader with a better relationship with Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, than Boris Johnson. I have seen it at first-hand over the years as the prime minister’s special envoy to the kingdom. The relationship is strong because it is both personal and critical.Johnson’s visit to Saudi Arabia this week will be pivotal on a number of fronts, and not merely with regard to oil. At a time when the US president has refused to speak directly with MBS, a calculated snub, the PM can consolidate the UK’s relationship with the largest power in the Middle East. Indeed, there is a key diplomatic role for the UK to play in winning back MBS’s confidence that the interests of Saudi Arabia are best satisfied through the Western alliance, rather than through the eastward drift of the past five years.This macro-political objective is especially important given the situation in Ukraine. Saudi enjoys a relationship with both Russia, through Opec, and China, as a supplier of oil and receiver of technological transfers. Its influence on both should not be underestimated. In particular, MBS could be a significant ally in helping to persuade Beijing to use its influence to press Putin for a ceasefire in Ukraine and to mediate between him and the countries opposed to his invasion. It would be in everyone’s economic interest, including Saudi Arabia’s, to avoid the global recession that the Ukraine war threatens. The stakes are high but the arguments are strong for a mediator’s involvement in seeking a peaceful solution.The immediate issue for Johnson will be oil, of which Saudi Arabia is the swing producer. Given that the UK has restricted imports of oil and gas from Russia, his request will undoubtedly be for Saudi Arabia to take up the slack. There has been scepticism about whether the Saudis would accede to this. With oil above $100 per barrel, it would suit them to keep the revenues flowing into their treasury to fund their significant Vision 2030 infrastructure investments. But the prime minister is persuasive. I foresee him reaching some sort of accommodation on increasing oil supplies to Europe – at least to relieve the acute pressure in the immediate aftermath of the Russian oil embargo.There will be other issues to discuss. Johnson has been strongly supportive of MBS’s Vision 2030 programme, which will see his country move away from reliance on fossil fuels and embrace the green agenda. It was one of the signal achievements of Cop26 when the PM persuaded Saudi Arabia to embrace carbon neutrality. He has also actively lobbied for the listing in London of Saudi Aramco, the largest energy producer in the world. The progress of Aramco from a purely carbon producer to a significant green energy producer is one of the most remarkable changes that has occurred in Saudi Arabia. Now is the right time to give global investors the chance to invest in the company through the London Stock Exchange.When MBS last came to the UK, his visit was accompanied by the signing of a bilateral strategic agreement between Saudi Arabia and the UK in which the former’s Public Investment Fund committed itself to investing $20 billion in UK projects. This is a key deliverable and from a purely UK investment opportunity, some of this committed capital should flow following the visit.The bilateral relationship between the UK and Saudi Arabia is not that of a cosy supplicant but of a close historic friend, and one based on the belief that the values vital to our democratic world can be shared, even though the journey may have many bumps in the road.In light of criticism of Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, strong views have been directed at the very fact of the visit taking place. Others have argued that we should hold a velvet handkerchief to our nose, recognise that there are differences and carry on as if there were no issue to be dealt with. Neither of these views has been the UK’s way forward. The distinctive feature of our policy towards Saudi Arabia, developed while Boris was foreign secretary, has been to assume the role of a critical friend on human rights issues.The PM was uncompromising in addressing human rights issues, including our strong views against capital punishment, and was publicly and privately critical of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The constructive criticisms of a century-old friend will be taken seriously, if not fully accepted, but what will be clear is that measurable progress is being made in improving human rights, particularly women’s rights.Riyadh will be unrecognisable since Johnson’s last visit. There is a new social openness, on top of the significant progress towards reforming the judicial system and improving human rights. And he will not return empty-handed.Ken Costa was the Prime Minister’s Special Representative for Vision 2030 in Saudi Arabia and is co-chairman of Alvarium InvestmentsMore from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Ukraine must accept it will never be in Nato, says Volodymyr ZelenskyRussian TV presenter Marina Ovsyannikova who said ‘No’ to war interrogated for 14 hoursInvestigation into reports that three British ex-soldiers killed in Ukraine military base attackThe Queen gets back to work after missing Commonwealth Day serviceTwo journalists killed in Ukraine after vehicle comes under fireThe inside story of what Marina Ovsyannikova’s brave act will mean for Russia’s propaganda warMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ecologists build crayfish ark last ditch attempt save british","story":"An “ark” for Britain’s native crayfish has been launched in an attempt to rescue the species from its invasive edible cousins.Native white-clawed crayfish are increasingly being moved to safe pools where they can breed undisturbed by signal crayfish, as experts warn that their numbers are on a “knife-edge”.Signal crayfish were first introduced to the UK in the 1970s as a species to be farmed and eaten, but they have since bred out of control, leading to numbers of white-clawed crayfish dropping by up to 90 per cent in some parts of England.A larger and more aggressive species, the signal crayfish outcompete white-clawed crayfish, burrow into river banks, destabilising them and causing erosion, as well as spreading crayfish plague, which has a 100 per cent mortality rate in the white-clawed species.Desperate ecologists are now turning to “ark” pools to help the remaining white-clawed crayfish recover.One of the native species’ best remaining habitats is the River Wansbeck in Northumberland, so 100 have been taken to an adapted old cattle drinking hole at nearby Wallington, run by the National Trust.The so-called “ark” site will be a safe place for them to breed and re-establish their numbers, and follows similar projects in recent years by the Wildlife Trusts and the Environment Agency.Rangers have spent 15 months preparing, including using dry-stone walling techniques to create crevices that imitate the crayfish’s natural habitat.The site is fed by a spring, with the water flowing over significant barriers before it reaches the Wansbeck, meaning the chances of invasive American signal crayfish or plague entering are low.Matthew Fitch, a National Trust ranger at Wallington, said: “This species is very much on a knife-edge.“It’s so important we shore up the healthy populations, like the one we’re fortunate to have here on the Wansbeck, as quickly as we can, to make sure it doesn’t vanish from our rivers altogether.“The ‘ark’ site will not only give us a safe haven for white-clawed crayfish at Wallington but also contribute to the long-term protection of the animal, as the crayfish that are kept here can in theory be used to repopulate other water bodies.”Removing invasive crayfish causes ‘more harm than good’There is currently no clear solution to the problem of invasive crayfish. A study in 2020 by University College London found that trapping and removing the signal crayfish probably causes “more harm than good”.The method tends to trap larger iniduals rather than small ones and because crayfish are cannibals, this can actually lead to the general population doing better because the biggest predators are removed, the study found.The species can hitch a lift between rivers on trapping equipment, spreading them further, and the traps can also harm other animals such as otters.The University of Edinburgh is developing a “gene drive” technique to render the crayfish infertile in an attempt to control the population, the  reported last year.Ian Marshall, an Environment Agency bioersity technical specialist in the north east and the national species lead for white-clawed crayfish, said: “White-clawed crayfish are under threat nationally from the rapid spread of non-native crayfish and the diseases they carry, but we are fortunate to have some of the best populations here in Northumberland.“They are vital to our ecology, helping to keep our waterways clean and providing a source of food for other native species.“The Northumberland Crayfish Partnership is working hard to better protect them and this brilliant project at Wallington is one of many big plans to make 2022 the best year yet for the recovery of native crayfish across the region.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Ukraine must accept it will never be in Nato, says Volodymyr ZelenskyRussian TV presenter Marina Ovsyannikova who said ‘No’ to war interrogated for 14 hoursInvestigation into reports that three British ex-soldiers killed in Ukraine military base attackThe Queen gets back to work after missing Commonwealth Day serviceTwo journalists killed in Ukraine after vehicle comes under fireThe inside story of what Marina Ovsyannikova’s brave act will mean for Russia’s propaganda warMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland keep face masks another two weeks due spike cases","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has scrapped plans to lift Scotland’s strict face mask rules next week in a move businesses said would throw the country’s economic recovery into “reverse gear”The First Minister on Tuesday claimed a surge in Covid-19 cases meant it was “prudent” to keep mandatory mask rules, which had been due to be lifted on Monday after 20 months, until April 4 at the earliest.She claimed the move would be popular with “many people” concerned at a rise in cases which she blamed on a new “sub-variant” of Covid-19 which she said was placing the health service under “severe pressure”.However, businesses reacted furiously to the delay, claiming it would dent consumer confidence, create confusion among the public and slow down economic growth.Meanwhile, opposition MSPs pointed to figures that showed that Scotland’s stricter mask rules had not prevented case numbers soaring well ahead of England’s, where masks have not been mandatory since January and all other Covid laws were scrapped last month.‘A bitter disappointment for economy’Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said that the decision to delay the lifting of all restrictions had come as a “bitter disappointment”.“Further delay will put Scotland’s recovery into reverse gear again, create confusion, dent business confidence, putting the buffers on economic growth,” she said.“The success of the vaccine rollout minimises the risk of serious illness and should enable Scotland’s businesses and iniduals to begin living and working with increasing normality alongside the virus.“Businesses cannot continue to operate with the start-stop lever being pulled just weeks apart, with no clear confirmation as to what the triggers driving decision making are.”England and Northern Ireland have already ended all legal Covid-19 restrictions, while the Welsh Government plans to lift its coronavirus laws on March 28, although its mask rules are not as strict as Scotland’s.Ms Sturgeon said that all other legal restrictions, such as a requirement on hospitality venues to collect customers’ contact details and for businesses, places of worship and service providers to have “due regard” for her guidance, would end on Monday as planned.She told MSPs she hoped the mask rules would now end on April 4 but refused to rule out that she could yet announce a further delay. She claimed keeping masks “temporarily” would protect vulnerable people while chances of catching the virus are high.She told the Holyrood chamber that 38,770 new cases had been reported over the previous four days compared to 36,051 in the same period last week. Almost 2,000 people were in hospital with coronavirus, although a significant proportion of these are likely to be “incidental” admissions, meaning they are primarily there because of other health conditions.Despite Scotland having stricter rules, the Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 18 people north of the border had coronavirus in its most recent survey. This compared with one in 25 in England.Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said Ms Sturgeon’s reversal over face masks showed that she did not trust the public.“It’s bad enough that the First Minister has gone back on her word to businesses and the public by extending the facemask requirement,” he said.“But, worse still, she could not even guarantee that this would only be for a further two weeks.“That’s more unacceptable uncertainty for businesses and the public who have already sacrificed so much over the last two years.”Places where face coverings will continue to have to be worn include shops, public transport, churches and when moving around pubs and restaurants.Paul Waterson, spokesman for the Scottish Licenced Trade Association, said many Scots had become “jaded” by the mask rules and were now “simply not bothering”.“Our sector still has many ongoing issues to overcome and there is an onus on the Scottish Government to support our industry which is key to the economy and jobs,” he said. “We need them to promote confidence and positivity.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Ukraine must accept it will never be in Nato, says Volodymyr ZelenskyRussian TV presenter Marina Ovsyannikova who said ‘No’ to war interrogated for 14 hoursInvestigation into reports that three British ex-soldiers killed in Ukraine military base attackThe Queen gets back to work after missing Commonwealth Day serviceTwo journalists killed in Ukraine after vehicle comes under fireThe inside story of what Marina Ovsyannikova’s brave act will mean for Russia’s propaganda warMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein cant hide sorry history putin apologism","story":"Last week, caught on the hop by the behaviour of Vladimir Putin, for whom it has a soft spot, Sinn Fein – historically the political wing of the IRA – deleted 20 years of potentially embarrassing material from its official website: 2,729 pages of statements by its party representatives were reduced to 373.So presumably out went the justification for Sinn Fein MEPs abstaining in 2015 on a European Parliament resolution condemning Russia’s “direct and indirect involvement in the armed conflict in Ukraine and its illegal annexation of Crimea” any record of party leader Mary Lou McDonald attacking the then taoiseach Leo Varadkar for his “flagrant disregard for Irish neutrality” when the Irish government expelled a Russian diplomat after the Salisbury poisonings Sinn Fein MEP Lynn Boylan in 2019 voting in the European Parliament against plans to block a Russian gas line and MEP Chris McManus being one of 69 politicians out of 548 to vote against the resolution in the European Parliament supporting Ukraine’s independence last December.Sinn Fein is a cult whose members obediently parrot whatever party line they are given. But their politicians are world-class examples of the brass neck school of politics. They have been Putin apologists for years, and are now perhaps the closest to power of all the populist movements in Europe that have displayed unhealthy sympathies for Russia. But the party’s reaction to the West uniting against Putin’s brutal invasion of a sovereign state and the emergence of President Zelensky as a heroic and eloquent warrior for liberty was to change sides immediately.Without a blush, McDonald called for increased measures against Russia from the EU and “sanctions of such scale where there can be no doubt that Putin and his oligarch supporters will pay a huge price for choosing the course of military conflict over dialogue and diplomacy.”McDonald is a practised hand. In 2003, having become Gerry Adams’s protégé, she was tested for stardom by participating unapologetically in the annual ceremony at the statue of the IRA’s chief of staff, Sean Russell, who in 1940 died in a U-boat on his way back home after explosives training in Berlin.Her nickname for a time was “I believe Gerry”, the phrase she would trot out brazenly whenever anyone questioned his veracity. Her reward was to be appointed party president in 2018. And she is now hotly tipped to become taoiseach, Ireland’s prime minister.She has led Sinn Fein in its recent volte faces on the EU (which it opposed bitterly until about a decade ago) abortion, same sex marriage and a plethora of progressive causes, and mostly has managed to keep closed the cupboard with all the skeletons.Since she is in the US on a very public St Patrick’s Day charm offensive this week, it was a good day for bad news. Challenged in New York on the website deletions, she explained that this was just a routine overhaul – a housekeeping matter.She told a crowd at Fordham University that the “outbreak of conflict in Europe reminds us that peace, self-determination and sovereignty are precious and can never be taken for granted. Ireland understands the damaging and isive legacy wrought by colonisation, occupation and the denial of self-determination.” Putin would be proud of her.More from NewsAncient tombs found under Notre-Dame in ‘remarkable’ discovery by builders renovating spireRussia-Ukraine latest news: Ukraine must accept it will never be in Nato, says Volodymyr ZelenskyRussian TV presenter Marina Ovsyannikova who said ‘No’ to war interrogated for 14 hoursInvestigation into reports that three British ex-soldiers killed in Ukraine military base attackThe Queen gets back to work after missing Commonwealth Day serviceTwo journalists killed in Ukraine after vehicle comes under fireMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"university acting like soviet union cancels race commission","story":"The chairman of the Government\u0027s race commission has criticised Nottingham University for “acting like the Soviet Union” after it withdrew his honorary degree. Dr Tony Sewell was commissioned by Downing Street to investigate racial disparity in British society. Last March, he published a controversial report which concluded that we no longer see a Britain where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities. Following its publication, the report was quietly amended following a backlash over its claim that there was a new story to be told about the slave period, which was not just about profit and suffering. Nottingham University decided to offer Dr Sewell an honorary degree in late 2019, before he chaired the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities.However, in December last year, the institution informed him that it had withdrawn the offer, because he had become the subject of political controversy.\u0027There is no free speech\u0027Dr Sewell, 63 - who founded Generating Genius, a charity that helps black children access higher education - accused officials at the university of being “cowards”. He told the Daily Mail: I have helped thousands of black children from poor backgrounds to get into universities. I\u0027m a one-man levelling-upper.”But he said Nottingham University “said it would no longer be appropriate to award me the degree because they didn\u0027t want to offend the students at an award ceremony”.He added: How can you offend students with a report which says the equalities watchdog should have more power, that stop and search should be improved and that we need to get more people from ethnic minorities into university?Referring to R Kelly, the singer, and Bill Cosby, the comedian, who have faced sexual assault allegations in the United States, Dr Sewell added: These are the type of people you decide to withdraw honours from.”He said Nottingham University “have acted like cowards, subject to lobbying groups”.He added: I thought the work of a university was to deal with complex issues. Universities in England are like the Soviet Union. There is no free speech.At the time of publication last year, the report sparked claims of a whitewash from MPs, charities and organisations. The United Nations working group on human rights condemned it as reprehensible.\u0027No longer appropriate to award degree\u0027A University of Nottingham spokesman said: “The university has strict criteria governing the award of honorary degrees, as these are conferred at our public graduation ceremonies. The criteria preclude us from awarding them to figures who become the subject of political controversy.“Since making the decision to confer an honorary degree in late 2019, the university’s Honorary Degrees Committee noted that Mr Sewell became the subject of political controversy during 2021, and as such determined it would no longer be appropriate to award the degree. “In withdrawing the offer, the university is categorically not making any judgment on Mr Sewell personally or expressing a view on his work. It is simply about ensuring that we apply the same criteria to all of those we consider for the accolade of an honorary degree from the University of Nottingham.“We fully appreciate that was disappointing news and last December we offered Mr Sewell a sincere apology alongside an explanation for the decision. He remains a notable alumnus of the university and it is deeply unfortunate that we have had to withdraw the offer.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Ukraine must accept it will never be in Nato, says Volodymyr ZelenskyRussian TV presenter Marina Ovsyannikova who said ‘No’ to war interrogated for 14 hoursInvestigation into reports that three British ex-soldiers killed in Ukraine military base attackThe Queen gets back to work after missing Commonwealth Day serviceTwo journalists killed in Ukraine after vehicle comes under fireThe inside story of what Marina Ovsyannikova’s brave act will mean for Russia’s propaganda warMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"golden retriever adorably leaves owner","story":"Golden retriever adorably leaves owner for new family every time she goes outThree-year-old Layla has so much love to give she has to ditch her owner on walks to snuggle up with complete strangers - and they just cant get enough of her warm cuddlesthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video golden-retriever-ditches-owner-sit-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:TvsYGam,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mantisRecommender.recommenderMaxMpuNumber:,mantisRecommender.autoplayInterval:,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,amp.trackonomics.enabled:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,authUI.default:true,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,adServedMastheadStripEnabled:true,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,mantisRecommender.hbEnabled:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,M.apiUrl:https:partner-widget-api-prod.tm-awx monitizer  compare prices gbp_en,publicationName:Mirror,mantisRecommender.limit:,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,convoStarterEnabled:true,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But despite feeding, walking and smoothing them with affection, sometimes theyaposre more interested in spending time without you.One owner, who is regularly aposditchedapos by her dog when out on walks, has noticed how her golden retriever would rather spend time with stranger than stay by her side.Owner Maggie Daly, from New Jersey, has shared an sweet video of her three-year-old dog loving on complete strangers during their trips to the beach.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. The video has racked in , likes on Instagram and has received hundreds of comments from dog lovers who just canapost get enough of Laylaaposs adorable antics.Maggie said: She does it whenever we go to the beach, which is pretty much everyday. She spots a person or group of people - typically when they are sitting down - and sprints toward them and sits down either right next to them or on their lap. I can usually tell right awaythe person or people are interested in having her invade their space or not andthey are not happy about it I call her back and she - most of the time - will come back or move on to the next group of people.  Most people seem happy about it and will pet her, take pictures with her, throw her ball for her. She will stay with a group for as long as they give her attention and then move on to another group of people. Having been aposloving on strangersapos since she was a puppy, Maggie was anxious about her dogaposs behaviour at first, worried she would be bothering people. I thought I needed to train it out of her but now I realise most people really enjoy her running over to say hi and spread a little love and she also enjoys the extra pets and hugs, she added. A person even commented on the video that her son was one of the people in the video and they had recently lost their golden retriever and he was so happy and thought it was his dog’s way of saying hi. Layla is said to have a larger than le personality and never fails to greet everybody who walks through her door with toys, pillows or blankets. Commenting on the video, one user said: It looked like first guy pulled out his phone to take a selfie and sweet pup leaned in like a pro for the picture. While another added: I hope I am somewhere that you are so I can get hugs. A third said: Your dog shares the love that you give her each day - thataposs a big talent and this is amazing.

It should, but it probably won’t. What is becoming increasingly clear is that the slaughter of innocent civilians by Putin’s military forces guarantees the Kremlin killer will go down in history as a reviled leader who wrecked his own country to destroy another. Because many more will die in a terrible conflict that is all about one man’s vile and foolish quest to build an empire in his honour. The bloodshed is escalating as the war runs out of control, with missiles hitting a base near the Polish border and the fatal shooting of award-winning US filmmaker Brent Renaud. No one knows how this will end but that is no reason for our Government and others not to keep searching for a way to persuade – or force – Putin to withdraw.  Visas shame The great generosity of the British people towards Ukrainian refugees is far more inspiring than Conservative ministers who had to be dragged kicking and screaming every step of the way. It is absolutely shaming that just , visas have been issued when over . million desperate Ukrainians have fled Putin’s terror.  While the bureaucrats continue to put up obstacles, millions are prepared to open their homes to those seeking sanctuary here. The Refugee Council’s concern over the level of support for war victims and Labour’s accusations of foot-dragging reveal the truth about the £-a-month Homes for Ukraine offer. Those arriving require sympathy and help, and genuine fears need to be addressed. Star power Putinaposs growing isolation was again underlined as stars expressed support for Ukraine at last night’s Baftas. Awards are great but Benedict Cumberbatch expressing solidarity with an invaded country reminds us what is really important.

Lord Young of Norwood Green stood up just after pm to speak in the catchily-titled Genetically Modied OrganismsRegulations . But the -year-old was blocked from taking part by a Tory whip, who claimed he had been snoozing earlier on - and had to be woken by a member of Lords staff. The former postal workers’ union leader protested he was “not now” asleep. According to Hansard, he protested: “I was not…”.It is not the first time someone has been accused of being asleep in Parliament, and previously some of those accused have insisted they were awake.MPs with hearing problems, for example, have been seen listening to speakers that are embedded in seats, while shutting their eyes to concentrate. But it is rare for one person in Parliament to directly accuse another of snoozing on the job. As he stood to speak in the debate, Lord Young said: I wanted to take part in this debate because I stake my position as somebody who is a Remainer. “Butthereaposs two things that I welcome in coming out of the Common Market, one is the CAP and this particular gene editing... Government whip Baroness Bloomfield of Hinton Waldrist intervened to say: I am sorry, but the noble lord was fast asleep for the entire duration of the ministeraposs speech. He really should not participate in this debate having failed to take advantage of the ability to hear him. Lord Young, a former union boss who has also served as a BBC governor, replied: Sorry Lady Bloomfield said: I am afraid the noble lord was fast asleep for the entirety of the ministeraposs opening speech. Lord Young replied that he was not now asleep, but Lady Bloomfield said: Well I had to send a note to you - in order to wake you up - by the doorkeeper. The Draft Genetically Modied OrganismsRegulations  debated by peers would allow the UK to deviate from EU law on genetic modication of crops. The regulations would allow greater freedom for the practice of gene editing of plants in the UK. Environment minister Lord Benyon said the regulations would allow the UK to remain at the forefront of research into GM crops.

The latest available data from the Department for Education shows % of children - or , pupils - had a reading ability below their expected ability at the end of Key Stage  in . The number of youngsters struggling at the end of primary school had increased, compared to % - or , pupils - the previous year. Official figures, revealed by Schools Minister Robin Walker in a written parliamentary question, show the figure rose to above % in some constituencies such as Leeds Central, Peterborough and Dudley North.Mr Walker said no data was recorded for academic years   or   due to the impact of the COVID- outbreak.The Liberal Democrats said the data laid bare the reading crisis in schools - and warned it could be the tip of the iceberg after children suffered major disruption to their schooling during the pandemic. MPs warned last week that poorer pupils could be up to eight months behind at school after the pandemic and the Governmentaposs catch-up plans are failing to reach them.The Commons Education Committee said repeated school closures had a disastrous impact on childrenaposs education, with disadvantaged kids worst hit by months out of the classroom. Lib Dem education spokesperson Munira Wilson said: These figures reveal a reading crisis in our schools and they’re just the tip of the iceberg. The pandemic has had a huge effect on our children, and with reading ages already below standards for many before the crisis, the case now could be terrible for thousands of children across the country.  “Parents, teachers and pupils have not had a fair deal throughout this pandemic, no child should leave primary school unable to read at the standard level for their age - they need a chance to catch up. The party called for an urgent review into reading standards across the country and for ministers to pump more cash into catch-up programmes. The Government has announced £ billion in funding to help children catch up on lost learning over the pandemic - which has been criticised for falling short of the £ billion demanded by Boris Johnsonaposs education recovery tsar Sir Kevan Collins. A Department for Education spokesperson said: We are committed to raising literacy standards and our ambitious recovery plan is helping pupils make up for learning lost during the pandemic. Backed by £ billion, we are rolling out high-quality tutoring – which has seen a million courses started by pupils so far – alongside world class training for teachers and early years practitioners, and additional funding for schools.

Days later, he oversaw the largest mass execution in the country’s history. He is betting countries like the UK will look away, because they would rather fund his blood-soaked petro-state than Putin’s war machine. It is not an either or. There are better and more sustainable ways to deal with the energy crisis than empowering these regimes. By visiting Saudi Arabia, Johnson will confirm that the Kingdom will face no meaningful consequences for this mass execution. It virtually guarantees more people whose only crime was to protest against Bin Salman’s rule will be executed. People like Hassan al Maliki, an academic currently facing a death sentence for owning banned books.  The  executions at the weekend were probably beheadings, but Saudi ‘justice’ is such a black box we can’t be sure. The European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, which tracks death sentences in Saudi Arabia, didn’t even know about  of the cases. These men were tried, convicted, sentenced and executed in complete secrecy.Of the  we do know about, at least three were tortured into making  confessions to terrorism offences after taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations. Aqil al-Faraj was held in solitary confinement, beaten all over his body and tortured with electricity and cigarette burns. He was imprisoned for five years, without access to a lawyer, before trial. This is the reality of Saudi capital punishment. The authorities label executed men ‘terrorists’ but there are political prisoners, non-violent drug offenders, and people arrested as children on death row. In , the UK and Saudi governments signed a top secret ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ on judicial co-operation. Since this agreement has been in place, the Saudi regime led by King Salman and his son has dramatically increased the pace of executions – there have been more than  in all. Ministers claim the UK is a restraining influence, but the Saudis don’t seem to have noticed.Visiting Riyadh so soon after this mass execution shames the Prime Minister and shames Britain. We must not show our revulsion for Vladimir Putin’s atrocities by rewarding those of Mohammed Bin Salman.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON King SalmanBoris JohnsonVladimir PutinTerrorismHuman rightsPoliticsRussia Ukraine warDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Employees, MPs and trade union officials help placards as they called for more help as they battle rising costs.Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletterThey hope Chancellor Rishi Sunak will throw companies a leline when he delivers his Spring Statement next Wednesday.Paul McBean, , who is based at British Steel in Scunthorpe, Lincs, said the ongoing war in Ukraine demonstrated why the UK needed its own sovereign steel sector.He added: “The last three weeks have shown more than ever why we need our industry.” Clive Royston, , who works at Liberty in Stocksbridge, South Yorks, said was “fighting” to keep the job he “loves”. He warned: “We need steel for everything - at Stocksbridge we make anything and everything. “What sort of country are we without a steel industry ”Sector chiefs have grown increasingly worried about the impact of energy costs on the UK’s £.billion industry, which directly employs , workers and supports another , posts in supply chains.The Mirror told last week how  staff at Coventry-based Liberty Pressing Solutions face uncertainty after efforts to sell the plant failed.  Employees are currently in the middle of a -day consultation on redundancies. Campaigners have also called on the Government to help the industry slash emissions and “green” the sector so it can thrive while helping fight climate change. Britain’s steel sector belched out about  million tonnes of carbon dioxide - including indirect emissions from power production - in . It accounted for .% of UK industrial emissions and .% of all Britain’s greenhouse gases. Jacqui Thomas, who works at Tata in Llanwern, Newport, said: “With government help it can be environmentally friendly. “It’s vital for our future and for generations to come.”  As well as asking for medium-term support to ease emissions, campaigners also want immediate help with energy costs. Community steelworkers’ union general secretary Roy Rickhuss said: “Unaffordable energy prices threaten the future of British steelmaking and it’s past time the Government delivered on promises of support.“ Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine brings new uncertainties to the world, and reinforces the need for a strong domestic steel industry at the base of strategic supply chains vital to our national security.“We need our steel for our safety, for a secure and green economy, and for tens of thousands of jobs across the country.  “The Chancellor’s upcoming statement presents a golden opportunity for this government to get off the fence to back British jobs and put levelling-up into practice.” Unite national officer Harish Patel said: “The UK’s steelmaking capabilities are part of the nation’s critical infrastructure and support jobs and communities across the country. “Unite has long called for government action to reduce the exorbitant energy costs that hinder the UK’s steel industry and which are now being made even worse by the war in Ukraine. “As a matter of urgency, ministers must take steps to reduce energy bills and business rates for the sector and ensure that public contracts use UK steel.” Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Steel, said: “Our steelworkers make the best steel that money can buy, but they’re constantly being forced to compete with one hand tied behind their backs due to the UK Government’s refusal to support this vital foundational industry. “The disparity between what UK steel makers are paying for their energy and what their competitors in Germany and France are paying is truly eye-watering, and we need urgent action to close that gap through a range of policy measures such as regulating and capping wholesale costs and reducing the astronomical grid connection costs.”The Mirror has campaigned to Save Our Steel since .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LibertyBritish Steel PLCSpring StatementStephen KinnockClimate changeEnergy billsPoliticsRussia Ukraine warSave Our Steel campaign\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

After she stopped taking the contraceptive pill, the pair hoped nature would take its course and Diana would soon fall pregnant. Before long, they got their wish and Diana, now , discovered she was expecting a baby. But tragically, she miscarried. The following year in , Diana was once again hopeful after falling pregnant for a second time, but suffered heartbreak again when she lost the baby. From the minute she stopped taking the pill, the hopeful mum realised something wasn’t right - and she went to the doctor with her concerns. “I’ve always had painful periods since I was a teenager. I went to see doctors but I was told, ‘some women get painful periods’,” she told The Mirror. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here “I used to get very sharp pains in my lower abdomen but I noticed it wasn’t only during the days I was on my period - also at random times, mid-cycle.” Diana was told she was experiencing “ovulation pain” that would go away when she got pregnant - but until then, she should take the pill to manage it. When the pair decided to try for a baby and Diana stopped taking the pill, she says the pain came back. “I had pain passing stools and urine, I was bloated and was generally feeling unwell,” she said. Diana claims she went back to the doctor complaining of sharp pains in her abdomen and was just given antibiotics. But after two miscarriages, she was sure something more serious was wrong and was eventually sent to see a gynaecologist.  “An ultrasound scan showed cysts on my oies, fibroids and suspected endometriosis,” she said. Fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in and around the womb, and are thought to be more common in Black women. Endometriosis is a condition where the lining of the womb begins to grow in other places such as the oies or fallopian tubes. It can cause signicant pain and can result in dficulty getting pregnant. After a laparoscopy, it was confirmed Diana had endometriosis - and the lining of her womb was growing in her bladder, bowels, appendix and colon. “It was very scary,” Diana said.  “But I was relieved to finally have a reason for the stabbing pain that I had been having.” Diana and Moses kept trying for a baby, but they had no luck. Eventually their doctor referred the couple for fertility treatment and they began the process of IVF. However, due to Diana’s endometriosis, she also had to have several operations, including a myomectomy to remove the fibroids and womb lining. “The operations were to remove the endometriosis, resection of fibroids, removing the scarring caused by the endometriosis and unsticking the tubes which have been blocked by the endometriosis,” Diana explained. She added that during one operation, surgeons had even removed her appendix because there were signs of endometriosis there. Despite having to have more operations than she can count, Diana says she’s grateful for her “brilliant” consultant at TFP Wessex Fertility and doctors at Basingstoke Hospital.Read More While going through the physical toll of the operations, Diana also suffered three more miscarriages during her IVF journey. Determined not to give up, she and Moses tried again. But after Diana had her eggs collected on her last cycle, she realised something wasn’t right. “I was feeling very bloated and sore, I was in so much pain,” Diana said. “By the second night I was feeling so poorly and could hardly move. I hadn’t been passing much urine even though I’d been drinking a lot. “In the middle of the night I was struggling to breathe so I phoned an on-call doctor.” After speaking to the doctor, Diana was sent to the women’s ward. By now she was in so much pain she was “gasping for air.”  “They wheeled me straight in for an X-ray where they discovered I had lots of fluid in my lungs. “Back at the ward, I was surrounded by lots of doctors and they gave me an oxygen tube to help me breathe and strong pain medication.” Doctors told Diana she had oian hyperstimulation syndrome . OHSS is more likely to occur in women having IVF after taking hormones to stimulate egg production. It causes the oies to swell with eggs, which can be incredibly painful and cause blood clots. In rare, severe cases, it can be fatal. Feeling delirious from the painkillers, Diana said she didn’t understand how serious her condition was when doctors took her to intensive care. But she does remember seeing the results of her X-ray - which showed her right lung was submerged in fluid.  Doctors inserted a tube into Diana’s lung to drain the fluid, and thankfully she was allowed to leave intensive care three days later. After being sent home to recover from OHSS, Diana waited a few months before having embryos transferred into her womb in February .By March, she took a pregnancy test that came back positive.“I was excited but still apprehensive due to the previous miscarriages,” Diana said. She added she was also nervous because, throughout the pregnancy, the sharp pains in her abdomen never went away - despite what she’d been told by doctors in the past. She said: “Week by week as I had my scans, I was reassured that despite the pain I was having, the baby was ok. “First, we saw the sac on the ultrasound, and then the flickering heartbeat.” But when she finally reached the  week mark, Diana said she cried “tears of joy.” After a painful pregnancy during which Diana had to be scanned every fortnight, the couple welcomed their daughter Siimainto the world on the st November , and after nearly a decade of trying, the pair were finally parents. “I say this over and over again - I would go through all the surgeries, the pricks and the pain to have our beautul daughter,” Diana said. “She has a beautul personality and brings us so much joy. I think I’d be lost without her.” Despite her baby joy, Diana still lives with intense pain from endometriosis, which she believes has worsened since she gave birth. She is even considering a hysterectomy as she’s “tired of living with pain” which affects all aspects of her le. “Not only does it affect me physically, but also my lestyle and relationships with my friends and family,” she said. “PerhapsI was diagnosed earlier it would have been a dferent story. “The doctors were helpful but I think we need a lot more research and conversation so that women’s pain isn’t dismissed as ‘just period pain’.”Do you have a story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PregnancyMiscarriageIVFFertilityPeriods\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Eight years on, Jack is now a Therapy Dogs Nationwide volunteer and regularly visits Southport Hospital and Queenscourt Hospice to cheer up the staff and patients in critical care.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. When Jack was five years old, Judith took him into her motheraposs care home and saw how much the elderly loved spending time with him.

Jack Daniels is one of three border collies living with Judith, alongside -year-old Guinness and -year-old Tia - all named after popular spirits - but he is the only one able to be a therapy dog.

He loves walks on the beach every morning and most enjoys going to hospital wards to meet new people.Before the pandemic, we would visit all the dferent wards, from spinal injuries to the stroke unit, intensive care and critical care. They would request visits from Jack, Judith explained. Now we arenapost allowed to visit the wards, so we just go in for the staff every fortnight.

And temperatures could be higher than some Spanish holiday resorts including the Costa Brava where it is unlikely that the mercury will rise above C. The mild weather comes after a freezing start this morning, with temperatures having dropped as low as -C in central England. According to the Met Office, average temperatures for this time of the year were -C in the south and -C in the north. Mr Miles said temperatures were slightly above average for this time of year. A front tomorrow will bring slightly cooler temperatures, with a high of C in southeast England.  The Midlands would see wet and wintry conditions while Scotland and Northern Ireland could expect drier weather, but temperatures decidedly in the single figures. For most parts, it would be a cloudier day with rainy periods. However, the rain was expected to clear by Thursday as a warm front moved up from the south, bringing sunny spells and temperatures of -C. Friday will get off to a chilly start but would be a dry day across the UK as temperatures picked up once more to C, possibly C in the southeast. UK forecast for the next  days Some pleasant sunshine for many today northwest corner wet, windy. Today:Early fog patches clearing, then sunny spells for many, especially over England and Wales where feeling rather warm. Cloudier for parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, where wet and windy in parts of north and west, with coastal gales possible. Weakening rainband moving southeast across Scotland and Northern Ireland, clearer colder conditions following. Areas of cloud and rain developing across parts of England and Wales, where it will be milder.Wednesday:Northwest corner bright and fresh-feeling, scattered heavy showers later. Elsewhere often cloudy, showery rain turning heavier across some eastern areas. A few brighter, warmer spells, perhaps focused in southwestern areas.Outlook for Thursday to Saturday:Heavy, blustery showers in the north and northwest Thursday, dry with sunny spells where. Most places will be fine and dry Friday and Saturday. Chilly mornings, but mild by day.

So, when the Palace announced the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were expecting their second child in , people couldnapost wait to find out more.During Kateaposs pregnancy, in which she suffered from severe sickness, there was huge speculation over the gender of the second senior royal baby - and what the child would be called. Many royal fans were also curious to know what the royal baby might look like, with some even going as far as using prediction websites to get an idea of how Princess Charlotte would look and the results were... a little creepy. The prediction site allows users to upload photos of both the mum and dad, which it uses to create a bizarre mash-up of how the child may look. Someone did exactly that, by using photos of Kate and Prince William to guess how Charlotte would look, and on reflection, the predictions were very, very wrong. In just two months, young Charlotte will celebrate her seventh birthday but sheaposs already become a firm favourite among royal fans. Born on May , , Charlotte made history when her brother Prince Louis was born as she became the first woman in history to keep her place in the line of succession despite having a younger male sibling. She might only be six, but the Princess is often described as the most outspoken and determined of all of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs children, with Kate previously joking she was the boss of their household. Royal expert Katie Nicholl previously told the Mirror: Charlotte is the most buoyant and outgoing of the three Cambridge children. It’s that strength of character that will stand her in good stead when she’s older.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Gavin lives in the top floor flat in Glenburn with we Cherine, -year-old daughter Elisha, three-year-old Freya and Arya, who’s one, and has been left angered by being bounced around by Scottish Water and Renfrewshire Council, who are both investigating the source of the problem, the Daily Record reports.He said: “We’ve had problems with the water since October last year but it properly stopped two weeks ago.  “I’ve been phoning Renfrewshire Council and Scottish Water every day, I keep being bounced between the two of them. It feels like no-one is taking any interest. “We can’t wash our clothes or our dishes or ourselves. We were going to my in-laws and my family to wash but they’ve both got Covid now so we’re stuck. “We paid out of our own pocket to stay at the Glenfer Hotel but we can’t afford to keep doing that.” The issue has been made more complex by the fact Gavinaposs flat is privately owned, while the flats below are council-owned.  If the source of the water problem is in the garden then it falls to Renfrewshire Council to fix it. If it’s in the street, then it’s down to Scottish Water. The dad-of-three, who says he reported the issue on February , added: “I’ve got a stoma bag which I need to keep clean. We need to make bottles for our youngest. “They should be paying for us to stay in a local hotel. I shouldn’t have to be chasing them to find out what’s happening. “There are five of us in our flat, it’s utter bedlam.”A spokesperson for Renfrewshire Council said: “Investigations have been carried out in conjunction with Scottish Water since the issue was first identied.“We have now identied the source of a water leak, and this will be fixed as soon as possible.” A spokesperson for Scottish Water confirmed the issue was not with the public water system. He said: “In response to reports of issues affecting the water supply to Mr Divers’ home, our local team has attended and investigated. “On each occasion, we have confirmed that there are no issues affecting the public water network that Scottish Water maintains. “We have been liaising with Renfrewshire Council and with Mr Divers to inform them of our findings and provide advice. “In an effort to help in the interim, we have provided a supply of bottled water this week on a goodwill basis. We hope that this will assist while the situation affecting the building’s private pipework is resolved.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Housing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

At the height of the pandemic, millions were plunged into online learning as schools remained open to vulnerable pupils and children of key workers only.Isolation of whole year groups then saw some children attend school for just a few days before being forced to isolate once again at home.A report from Englandaposs Childrenaposs Commissioner last week said the issue of identying where these aposmissing childrenapos were was an urgent problem.  Dame Rachel de Souza said: These findings shed light on a very concerning situation: we cannot identy where each child is. There are thousands of children who support services do not have contact with, and authorities are therefore unable to ensure their safety, wellbeing and learning. This is an urgent problem that requires immediate, collaborative and practical solution.Jonathan Green, Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Manchester University explained to The Times how childrenaposs mental health may have been affected so badly by the lockdown, they are now finding it a huge struggle toto normal le - and even leave home to meet with friends. He also explained how children who were already deemed vulnerable and to whom school offered a respite from turbulent family homes were not at increased risk of becoming aposinvisibleapos. Prof Green said : Socially vulnerable children were a real concern and remain a real concern. In terms of this group of children who we have always been concerned about in terms of not being at school and sort of lost to sight - but there are lots more of them now. I would say there were three groups impacted. The first is a group who are prone to social anxiety and worries.  This pandemic exasperated a lot of these fears and anxieties and has caused a real legacy. Prof Green went on to explain how the second group of children are those who have neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities, such as children with autism. He explained how the Invisible nature of Covid was a huge issue for these children - who feared even leaving home for worries the wind could carry Covid and bring illness to them and their families - causing them to become obsessively worried Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsMental healthCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Later, Laura stepped in to be a surrogate mum for EmmaEmma Smuts-Muller and her best friend Laura DonohoeByNatasha Wynarczyk:,  Mar |commentsOver the course of their -year friendship, Emma Smuts-Muller and Laura Donohoe have been there for each other through thick and thin.But now the pair share an even more special bond, after caring Laura stepped in to be a surrogate mother for her best friend - after being bridesmaid for her just months earlier. Emma saw her hopes of conceiving dashed after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in September  and had to undergo treatment which affected her fertility.But thanks to Laura, Emma is now the proud mum of miracle baby Ella and is looking forward to a bright future.“Laura and I have always had an amazing connection with each other since we met at school,” says -year-old Emma, who lives near Birmingham and works as a chief of staff for West Midlands Police. “My husband Thomas and I had realised just how ready we were to have a baby, but after having breast cancer that decision was taken away from us. I will never be able to repay Laura for what she’s done for my family and it’s brought us even closer together.” In May , Emma married Thomas, , with Laura, , by their side as a bridesmaid. Soon after ing from their honeymoon in Lake Como, Emma was delighted to discover that she was pregnant, but tragically miscarried just eight weeks later. The couple were dealt another blow when Emma’s father Terry was diagnosed with leukaemia, then, that September Emma found a mass in her right breast. Scans quickly confirmed the diagnosis of breast cancer.  “I’d had some soreness that I’d initially put down to being pregnant, but when I noticed the changes in my breast I had an instant gut feeling that it was something bad,” Emma recalls. “Thomas and I had been on a massive high after the wedding, and to get pregnant so quickly it felt like everything was going to plan, but to be dealt so many devastating problems one after the other was really dficult for our family. “I just felt myself go into fight mode. I tried to not think too far into the future because it would have been too overwhelming. I knew I had no option but to get on with le.” Emma underwent eight cycles of chemotherapy which started in November . The following April, Emma had a mastectomy which removed her right breast as well as the cm cancerous tumour, then she went on to have two weeks of radiotherapy. Desperate to become a parent, Emma had been told by doctors that the chemotherapy could affect her fertility so she’d been offered IVF before starting her cancer treatment. However, despite successfully freezing  embryos it became clear that it wouldn’t be an option for Emma to carry one of them herself.  Emma says: “Because my breast cancer was linked to hormones, I had oian supression treatment. I was also told I need to take tamoxen - which I am on for  years - to stop the cancer ing. Due to the previous treatment, and the fact tamoxen stops your oies working, I began to go into the menopause. “Doctors also don’t allow you to get pregnant on tamoxen, and due to my age, I would have potentially been too old to carry my own child once I stopped taking the medication.” Emma and Thomas began to explore the possibility of using a surrogate to conceive, then one night Laura, who has two daughters aged seven and  with her husband Rob, came over to their house and told them she would be willing to carry their child. “She just dropped it out there that she would consider being our surrogate, which took us both massively by surprise,” says Emma.“However, due to the coronavirus pandemic the plans were put on hold for a few months, and despite having such a long time to mull it over she didn’t change her mind. I was so grateful to her.”In February , Laura was implanted with one of Emma and Thomas’s embryos. The trio then had a nail-biting two-week wait until Laura could do a pregnancy test.“When she sent the picture of the positive test through, we were so shocked - but really delighted,” says Emma. “We did this part of the fertility treatment with a private clinic but the doctors there told us there was only a % chance of it working due partly to my age and us using a surrogate, so I had prepared for the worst.” On November , Ella was born with Emma by Laura’s side as she went through labour. “Ella was  days overdue, so she did keep us waiting - however, she was definitely worth the wait,” says Emma. “Laura was very clear with her own children that she was just helping myself and Thomas out, and they really understood that. “I never had any worries that Laura would bond with Ella and find it dficult to give her over to us. “We don’t know yet when we will tell Ella how she was born, but it’s such a positive experience however we describe it. Most of all, we want her to understand what a miracle she is.” Now, Emma will have a yearly mammogram and speaks to her oncologist every six weeks to make sure the cancer hasn’t ed. Most of all, she is enjoying being a mum. She adds: “After coming through such a dficult time, Thomas and I finally have something positive to focus on. Laura is an incredible human being for carrying Ella for us.” Breast Cancer Now support and fund research into the condition.

But the Duchess of Cambridgeaposs younger sister had a slightly unusual idea when it came to the seating plan. Pippa married James Matthew in a stunning ceremony on May , , at St Markaposs Church in Englefield with their nephew Prince George and niece Princess Charlotte as the pageboy and bridesmaid.Following the ceremony, the  guests made their way to Bucklebury Village Hall, where they parked their cars ahead of the evening celebrations. They were then driven to Pippaaposs parentsapos estate - but not before each guest had their photo ID checked and their own password to get in.

When they arrived, they were greeted by a ft glass marquee in the garden, which had been decorated in an enchanted forest theme.  Guests took part in a number of fun games and watched an excellent light show before they were served food and drink including mini haggis, deer carpaccio, langoustine claws and asparagus with Hollandaise sauce. But when it was time to sit down to eat, guests were surprised to discover that Pippa hadnapost followed a conventional seating plan chart. Instead, she set a rule that they werenapost allowed to sit with their other halves.Although this is quite unusual, it does allow guests to get to know each other.According to Harpers Bazaar, the etiquette guide Debretts, It is up to the host to decide whether husbands and wives are to be seated together or apart at formal events. This meant that despite travelling , miles across the pond, Meghan Markle wasnapost allowed to sit with Prince Harry.But, it turns out that Meghan almost didnapost get an invite at all. Meghan and Harry hadnapost been together for too long when Pippa and James got married, so there was a lot of media attention on them. This worried Pippa as she feared that it would overshadow her big day. In their book Finding Freedom, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, claim that Meghan had planned to attend the full day, and even bought her outfit, but the decision was made that she skip it. So Harry went to the ceremony by himself, leaving Meghan at another wedding guestaposs Airbnb before they met up later to go to the reception together.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

During the visit, Charles was shown how to pull a Guinness and appeared to struggle as he had to be helped in tipping the glass to get the perfect pint. After topping up another pint that had been half poured, he only let it settle for a few seconds before taking a sip. And his struggle left we Camilla laughing - especially as he ended up with froth on his nose - while others mocked him online for his poor attempt. One person on Twitter pointed out: What the heck happened to that poor beer !While another joked it was badly poured. Another recommended: A stout like Guinness should rest for a minute or so before drinking it! While another, responding to a clip of Charles asking how long you have to wait before drinking a freshly poured Guinness, said: Answer  A lot longer than thatyou do it properly!

Elsewhere in the visit, both Charles and Camilla, who wore a green dress by Samantha Cameronaposs label Cefinn, were also given a quick lesson in how to play a bodhrán - a traditional Irish drum. They learned how to play a simple beat before the rest of the musicians joined in to play traditional Irish music - with the royals tapping their feet to the tune. The couple were also treated to an Irish dancing show before Charles unveiled a plaque to mark the visit. The visit to the Irish Cultural Centre comes just over a week until Charles and Camilla are set to visit the Republic of Ireland. They are making a short trip from March  to March . Meanwhile, later this week the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will also mark St Patrickaposs Day. On Thursday, they will attend the traditional St Patrickaposs Day Parade at Mons Barracks in Aldershot alongside the st Battalion Irish Guards.Prince William is Colonel of the Irish Guards and he and Kate have attended the annual event many times together in the past.During Thursdayaposs event, Kate will present sprigs of shamrock to the officers and guardsmen, who in turn will issue it along the ranks - a tradition carried out by royal women since . She will also present the regimental mascot, an Irish Wolf Hound, with his own sprig of shamrock, while William will take the salute during a march-past.

Both children attend Thomasapos Battersea in south London, with George in Year  and and Charlotte in Year , where insiders claim theyaposre treated like all the rest of the pupils, despite their royal status. To the world, theyaposre known as Prince George and Princess Charlotte, but while people at school are aware of their status, the children actually go by normal, non-royal names while at school.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Georgeaposs full name is George Alexander Louis, while is official title is His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge, but at school he goes by George Cambridge. Similarly, Charlotteaposs full name is Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, and her official title is Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, but at school she is simply known as Charlotte Cambridge.Their dad, Prince William, and uncle, Prince Harry, followed the same rule while at school, using Charlesapos title - Wales - as their surname. William and Harry also continued to use this moniker throughout their military careers. Meanwhile, at home, Kate Middleton has her own name for six-year-old Charlotte, which was revealed while she chatted to a fellow mum and her son during a trip to Northern Ireland in . Kate was speaking to Laura-Ann and her son Bertie, later sharing the exchange on Instagram : She asked how old Bertie is, and I said he is four and she said, aposOh, heaposs the same age as Lottie.apos She calls her Lottie!

The monarch pulled out of attending the Commonwealth Day service on Monday, a decision understood to be related to her comfort rather than a specic illness. She now regularly uses a stick and remarked during a r ecent Windsor audience “Well, as you can see, I can’t move”. Her Majesty has also just recovered from a bout of Covid and spent more than three months resting on doctors’ orders from October and only carrying out light duties after an overnight stay in hospital for tests. And editor of Majesty magazine, Joe Little, has suggested the head of state could be absent from key events in the royal calendar such as the Order of the Garter ceremony and Royal Ascot.Celebrations for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee are set for June over a busy four-day weekend including a service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral. It has not yet been confirmed which events the Queen will attend and how much she will be seen. Mr Little told PA: “At a service – you’re getting up and down – and it’s tricky. If Westminster Abbey wasn’t possible, it makes you wonder whether St Paul’s Cathedral will be possible during the main Jubilee celebrations. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .“Garter, Royal Ascot, big ceremonial events that involve her normally getting in and out of carriages and getting dressed up, I just feel that’s not going to be possible in the future. “But you know, a lot can happen between now and then and so we will think positive thoughts.” Mr Little also believes the Queenaposs diary will neverto its pre-pandemic days because of her age and her frailty. He added: “The programme will be pretty sparse. The Palace is clearly going to look at what’s planned and commit to as little as possible because the problem is obviously to do with mobility.  “The sht has been going on for some time and it’s been accelerated by the Covid situation. “Two years ago, the Commonwealth service was one of the last things the Queen did before moving to Windsor for the duration and of course, she’s never really come back. “The pandemic has in many ways slowed her down. The programme will never really get back to how it was pre-pandemic, I would say, because of her age and her frailty.”  He questioned whether the monarch, who turns  next month, will be mobile enough to hand out Maundy money to nearly  pensioners in April in keeping with an ancient Easter custom. “It seems very unlikely that the Queen will distribute Maundy money in the way she once did because it involves a lot of people and standing for quite some time. Unfortunately, I think those days are gone. She’s nearly ,” he said. But Mr Little added as long as the Queen remains “pin-sharp” mentally she will be able toas monarch, including dealing with her red boxes of papers. “The Queen always strives to be visible, and of course, given her frailty, she’s much less visible than she would perhaps like to be,” he said. “But the fact that she’s still able to perform the s of head of state – the paperwork, the messages, all the stuff that doesn’t require physical presence – so as long as she remains pin-sharp mentally then there’s no reason to think that she can’t fulfil much of her duties, but just in a less visible manner.” The Queen switched to on-screen engagements for much of the pandemic and recently carried out a number of virtual audiences, and a handful of in-person ones. She reaffirmed the pledge of service she made as a -year-old in her Commonwealth Day message on Monday, saying: “In this year of my Platinum Jubilee, it has given me pleasure to renew the promise I made in , that my le will always be devoted in service.”Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the Queen’s future engagements.

The traumatic search by politan Police officers took place at the girlaposs school in the knowledge that she was menstruating and without another adult present, the safeguarding report revealed. It concluded that the strip search should never have happened, was unjustied and racism was likely to have been an influencing factor.According to the report, the impact on the secondary school pupil, referred to as Child Q, was profound and the repercussions obvious and ongoing. Family members described her as changing from a happy-go-lucky girl to a timid recluse that hardly speaks, who now self-harms and needs therapy. Scotland Yard has apologised and said the incident should never have happened.  The Local Child Safeguarding Practice Review, published in March, was conducted by City  Hackney Safeguarding Children Partnershipfollowing the incident in late . It said police arrived at the school after being called by teachers, who said they were concerned that the teenager had drugs in her possession because she smelt of cannabis. She was taken to the medical room and strip searched by two female officers, while teachers remained outside. During the ordeal her intimate body parts were exposed and she was asked to take off her sanitary towel, according to the review. No drugs were found. She was then sent home by taxi, later sharing her distress with her mother. Her family strongly believe the strip search was a racist incident, and the review found that her experiences are unlikely to have been the same had she not been black.  It said it is highly likely that aposadultication biasapos was a factor, where adults perceive black children as being older than they are because they see them as more aposstreetwiseapos. It reads: The disproportionate decision to strip search Child Q is unlikely to have been disconnected from her ethnicity and her background as a child growing up on an estate in Hackney. In a written statement to the review, the girl said she cannot go a single day without wanting to scream, shout, cry or just give up. She said: All the people that allowed this to happen need to be held responsible. I was held responsible for a smell... but Iaposm just a child. The main thing I need is space and time to understand what has happened to me and exactly how I feel about it and getting past this exam season.She added: I need to know that the people who have done this to me canapost do it to anyone  ever again, in fact so no one  can do this to any other child in their care. Cllr Anntoinette Bramble, deputy mayor and cabinet member for Hackney Councilaposs Childrenaposs Services, and the mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said they were appalled by all aspects of the review. In a joint statement they said: Child Q was subjected to humiliating, traumatising and utterly shocking treatment by police officers - actions that were wholly disproportionate to the alleged incident to which they had been called. This is exacerbated by the fact that the strip search was carried out at school - a place where the child had an expectation of safety, security and care. Instead, she was let down by those who were meant to protect her. The police must stop inexcusable behaviours and mindsets in order to properly serve all our erse communities, they added. They have asked for a report in six to nine months on progress made regarding the reviewaposs eight findings and  recommendations. These include calls for the Department for Education to make more explicit reference to safeguarding in its guidance on searching, screening and confiscation, and for police guidance on strip searching children to clearly outline the need for a focus on safeguarding. The politan Police said the Independent Office for Police Conduct was investigating, following a complaint in May . Detective Superintendent Dan Rutland of the Metaposs Central East Command said: We recognise that the findings of the safeguarding review reflect this incident should never have happened. It is truly regrettable and on behalf of the Met Police I would like to apologise to the child concerned, her family and the wider community. Jabeer Butt, chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, said: It should shock everyone that a child can be strip searched with no safeguards in place. Whataposs also clear from this incident is that the reason these safeguards werenapost considered is because the child in question was black. All those involved in this horric incident must be urgently held to account.

On the face of it, the sweet snap is simply lining up the future of the British Monarchy, but royal author Andrew Morton claims it caused upset behind palace walls. The royal couple suspected that the entire institution was conspiring against them. As they saw it, the evidence was all around them, he writes, in an updated version of Meghan: A Hollywood Princess. The unspoken code was straightforward: the future of the monarchy was assured, with or without Meghan and Harry. These fears were later said to be confirmed when the Queen cancelled a meeting with Harry, in which heaposd wanted to discuss his royal future, Morton claims. This sense that, despite their international popularity, they were low down the royal totem pole was confirmed when Harry arranged to meet the Queen for a grandson-to-grandmother chat in early January, he writes. At the last minute the meeting was postponed. Harry suspected classic internal politics, his family concerned that anything the Queen agreed during informal conversations would be used by Harry as a negotiating tactic.

It was days later, on January , when Harry and Meghan made their shock announcement that they would be stepping back from senior roles within the royal family. Taking to social media to tell the world, the couple said theyaposd spent many months reflecting over their decision, adding that they had plans to carve out a progressive new role within [the] institution while becoming financially independent. Since then, Harry and Meghan have spoken publicly about their decision to leave, first when Harry appeared on The Late Late Show with James Cordon and then in their shock interview with Oprah Winfrey.While touring around LA on an open top bus with Cordon, Harry said: It was never walking away. It was stepping back rather than stepping down. It was a really dficult environment, as I think a lot of people saw. We all know what the British press can be like.It was destroying my mental health. I was like, this is toxic. So I did what any husband and any father would do, I need to get my family out of here. But we never walked away. As far as Iaposm concerned, whatever decisions are made on that side, I will never walk away. I will always be contributing. But my le is service, so wherever I am in the world itaposs always going to be the same thing. Harry and Meghanaposs subsequent interview with Oprah sent shock waves across the world, as they spoke about Meghanaposs poor mental health during her time at the Palace and claims an unnamed royal asked inappropriate questions regarding Archieaposs skin tone.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Four Legs - a pop-up restaurant operating at pub The Compton Arms in Islington shared a message from a blogger asking for five takeaway meals in exchange for an advertisement on their Instagram Stories. The influencer approached the restaurant over Direct Message, explaining how they were looking for a takeaway for them and their pandemic aposbubbleapos, infor a post. They also offered toto the pub, once it has reopened, and potentially share a photo of their food on their Instagram feedit could blend. But rather cheekily they found themselves directed to a police station after the request to the chef duo backfired. The exchange of messages was shared on Instagram last year by Four Legs, with the caption: Been reading a lot about the peasant’s revolt recently. Inspiring stuff.The influencer wrote: I am reaching out to askit would be possible to have a takeaway and in exchange for this Iaposll be happy to advertise you via my Instagram stories alongside a swipe up linkyou have a website to direct my followers to your website in the hope of it leading to an order. In another message, they askedthey could order food for their bubble alongside them - making a total of five meals. Appearing to go along with it, Four Legs replied: Thataposs quite a lot of food,you could do a couple of posts then we can do it - youaposve got a lot of followers. They directed the influencer to head over for half six, adding: Thanks very much man, itaposs really appreciated. Appearing a bit lost, the influencer wrote back: Walked past NHS. I see  police vans. Past Sainsburyaposs. Four Legs replied: Yeah itaposs that end, head up there, let me know when you see the police station, which the influencer duly did. But he swtly realised he wasnapost getting a takeaway as the chef team replied: Magic - go in there and report yourself for crimes against the hospitality industry. The message exchange was shared on Instagram, where it racked up thousands of likes. Food critic Marina OaposLoughlin commented: Absolutely KILLER. Another commenter joked: Ironically, telling this egg where to go has actually got you guys more exposure than feeding a whole gang of lame influencers for free could ever get you!

Shabaz Ali, of Blackburn, Lancashire, has made a number of claims about things he learned during his days behind the counter. Amongst other claims, he has said that baristas use coffee syrup rather than real coffee in Frappuccinos, while alleging that they also serve decaf coffee to rude customers. Shabaz, , who now works as a teacher, has also advised customers as to how to get themselves some free goodies from Starbucks - including free drinks and baked goods. The ex-barista says he began working for the world-famous coffee brand back in , and really enjoyed his time there, being a fan of Starbucks to this day. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.In a fascinating TikTok video that has clocked up more than , views and over , likes, Shabaz has now shared alleged insider knowledge from his barista days.Shabaz said: I was going through training and the manager told me about purposely writing names on the cups wrong for free publicity. [They also told me] to look out for influencers or younger people who seem the type to make a scene about it on social media, as they’ll definitely post about it.I was shocked, as this was probably the reason my name would be spelled wrong in the past. Frappuccinos don’t have espresso coffee they have a fake flavour version – soyou want real coffee, you have to ask for an espresso shot. He added: I was also told to pretend that something wasn’t in stockit would hold up a queue. Frappuccinos would usually take a long time to make, so on a busy day, I would tell them some syrups were out of stock or the ice machine was broken. This really shocked me, as I know other companies must do this as well.He went on to reveal a few hints and tips to bag Starbucks freebies, including free beverages and has also explained exactly what happens to leftover items. Shabaz said: You get a free drink on your birthdayyou tell the barista. At the end of the night, the bakery items need to be thrown out – soyou ask a barista, they might give these away to you. Some of this is taken to homeless shelters or given to the homeless, but most stores just bin food waste. If someone is a regular, you can give them syrups and other goodies for free. Most food is tried by the staff before it comes out, so always ask for their recommendations. They will also try a combination of all sorts and have their own secret special drinks, so ask them for advice and they’ll always get you what you want. He added: Drip filter coffee can be refilled for freeyou sit in. If you hate your drink, ask for another one, as the barista will always change this for you. If you ask for a medium drink, but want it in a large cup, chances are the barista will fill the cup for you because they always make a bit extra – so you get a large drink for free. Sadly, some Starbucks customers may be dismayed to learn that, according to Shabaz, there is no secret menu.Aghast fans have since expressed their surprise at some of the more unexpected revelations, with one person commenting, the decaf bit scared me. Another remarked, I heard the name thing but wasnapost fully sure, glad to get a confirmation, while a third person laughed, “I said my name’s Michelle they wrote McHale.

One new mum claims to have found herself in a trying situation after giving birth to her twins. Their father decided to up and leave when she was around  weeks pregnant and didnapost really show any excitement about becoming a dad for the duration of her pregnancy.The minimal contact the pair had during the pregnancy mainly centred around topics such as custody, with the dad fighting for % custody.

The confused mother was therefore surprised when he reacted angrily to her choosing the babiesapos names without him and giving them her surname - having assumed he just wouldnapost care.

He didnapost even so much as send a text to check on them. She wrote: Obviously you need to name your kids and so I ended up choosing them myself since we hadnapost gotten to that stage. I also gave them my last name since Iaposll be the one to do appointments etc and raise them. From his lack of interest throughout pregnancy, I didnapost think he cared.Three weeks after the birth, the anonymous poster - who goes by the username u CraftyHold - was finally able to take her babies home.

She was very surprised by his response.According to the mother: He said they donapost look like their names and the names are aposstuck upapos names. He then says their names and his last name, but I corrected him and told him theyaposd taken my surname. He got p***ed and it became a tense situation. He demanded I change their names, I said no. He told me to combine our last names, I said no. I told him a parent that fights for % custody of their kids doesnapost show much concern or care about said kid, especially since there are no physical mental etc reasons to not be able to parent. She continued: He told me I was unreasonable and unhinged, I told him that paying child support was the bare minimum andhe wanted a say in their names, he shouldaposve shown up called when they were born and not waited three weeks to even ask what their own kidsapos names were..

She said: Drawer interiors, in general, are not easy to clean. You need to empty out all kinds of utensils or tools to get to the mess and drawers are awkward spaces to wipe or vacuum.If you do vacuum the interior, you definitely need to wipe it out because you don’t want the tools you use to clean your floors to indirectly come into contact with items used to cook or eat.The answer then is rigorous prevention.

Russia has allegedly asked China for financial and military assistance in the ongoing war in Ukraine, according to reports. But China has refuted this is the case, with a Chinese Embassy spokesman in the US stating it was “news to [him]. Russia calling on North Korea for help should come as no surprise, with Pyongyang having historically been a key ally of Moscow through its historical ties with the Communist era of the soviet union.

Reports of this nature have not been veried by other sources.Despite the lack of active help, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has previously publicly backed President Vladimir Putin over his actions in Ukraine.In its first official statement on Russiaaposs attack, the Foreign Ministry said that the West was guilty of abuse of power.North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations said the US and its allies are the root cause for the crisis in Ukraine, having ignored Russia’s reasonable and just demands for security. Kim Song, the North Korean diplomat, criticised the hegemonic policy of the US and the West that he said threatens the security and territorial integrity of sovereign nations. Speaking at a UN General Assembly meeting, Kim said: The greatest danger the world faces now is high-handedness and arbitrariness by the United States and its followers that are shaking international peace and stability. The Soviet-era allies share an -mile-long border and are both strongly motivated by anti-West and anti-NATO sentiments. The last missile launch was on February  when North Korea said it tested systems for a reconnaissance satellite. North Koreaaposs ballistic missile launches are banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions, which have imposed sanctions on the country over its weapons programmes.

The space agency says thereaposs nothing to be worried about as itaposs one of a dozen scheduled to fly past this week. Even though the speedy object has been added to the space agencyaposs Close Approaches database they have been quick to stress it poses little dangers.  Any space object that comes within almost five million miles of us is automatically considered potentially hazardous. The  DP will make its way towards Earth imminently, but it isnapost going to come too near.  The distance it will approach is roughly three times the space between Earth and the Moon. The space experts have moved to calm any fears and say there wonapost be any close calls in our letime.Nasa knows of no asteroid or comet currently on a collision course with Earth, so the probability of a major collision is quite small, NASA said. In fact, as best as we can tell, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years.  Earlier this month an asteroid, which NASA says is up to ,ft wide, flew past without a problem. Almost four times bigger than the Efel Tower and the Shard, it barely registered. The magnitude of the asteroid is recorded at .H which refers to the visual magnitude an observer would recordit were placed  Astronomical Unit away. It was first found in February  by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research project in New Mexico, USA, and last seen near Earth in February . The rock has been approaching the planet on an almost yearly basis and is due to come back again next February and April.

Kayla Barron and Raja Chari are conducting the six-and-a-half-hour mission, named US EVA , aimed at replacing equipment, some of which is  years old. It is the start of a busy period of operations, NASA said - with uncertainty over Russiaaposs cooperation.Before the start of todayaposs spacewalk, NASA posted on Instagram : ASA astronauts Kayla Barron and Raja Chari will set their U.S. spacesuits to battery power on Tuesday at .am EDT signying the start of a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk.The duo will install modication kits on the Starboard- truss structure that will ready the space station for its third roll-out solar array. The pair were pictured during training at the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory in Houston, Texas. The operation is being live-streamed by NASA on YouTube.Explaining the purpose of the spacewalk, the agency said in a statement: The planned .-hour Extravehicular Activity– US EVA- – is being performed by astronauts Kayla Barron and Raja Chari and is the th EVA for construction, operation, and maintenance of the International Space Station . The spacewalk officially began at : UTC to install a so-called “mod kit” on power channel A’s Mast Canister Assemblylocated on the Starboard-Truss. The mod kit is essentially a mounting frame that will allow future spacewalkers to install a new ISS Roll-Out Solar Arrayas part of the ongoing ISS Power Augmentationprogram.  The IROSAs are gradually being installed on top of six of the station’s eight Solar Array Wingsto increase the ISS’s electrical power output from its current level of kW up to kW. NASA said the work is essential to replace ageing equipment. It said: Adding six new, smaller arrays – built by Boeing – is necessary due to degradation in the power output level of the SAWs, some of which have now been on-orbit for over  years. While the IROSAs are around half the size of the SAWs, they are around twice as efficient, meaning they produce about the same amount of power.

Russian soldiers have started to buckle under the pressure of Ukraineaposs resistance to the invasion which was expected to end in days but is now entering its third week.Up to , Russian troops have been killed, scores of aircrafts shot down and tanks and helicopters destroyed, according to Ukrainian reports. It is running out of manpower and running out of energy.

However, a spokesperson for the embassy of China denied knowledge of his plea while North Korea allegedly responded you are too insane for us, according to the author of XSoviet-News Sarah Hurst on Twitter.This has not been veried by other sources.  Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Now the Russian army could be just two weeks away from culmination point while advances across Ukraine have already stopped.President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed that message in an early morning speech to his people.The Ukrainian leader said that his army continues to inflict devastating losses on Russian soldiers and that soon the number of fallen Russian helicopters will reach the hundreds with  warplanes already wiped out.  Hundreds of tanks and thousands of other units of equipment, he added. In  days, the Russian army has lost more in Ukraine than in two bloody and years-long wars in Chechnya.But Russiaaposs method of attack has become more brutal as the invasion is questioned, with cities facing more indiscriminate rocket fire.Ukraineaposs capital of Kyiv suffered more bombings on Tuesday when apartment blocks caught fire in early morning strikes with the number of casualties unclear.  Retired General Ben Hodges, former commanding officer of the US Army in Europe, told MSNBC of Russiaaposs decision to transition to a war of attrition. He said: “They’re smashing cities, putting civilians on the road because of fear of being murdered. They need three things to do this and they don’t have those three things – they don’t have the time, they don’t have the manpower, and I don’t think they have the ammunition. That means they won’t be able to continue the attack.  The retired general called on The West to speed up the delivery of Ukrainiansapos capabilities and destroy Russian long-range artillery, rocket launchers and missile sites. “It’s kind of a race, actually, he continued.If we give the Ukrainians enough, where they can outlast Russia until Russia culminates, then in my assessment, unless something dramatically dferent happens, it’s about  days.”Putin might turn to aposplan Bapos – non-conventional weapons – as the invasion of Ukraine falters, a leading Russian journalist has said.Kremlin troops have continued to bombard civilians in the besieged cities of Kharkiv and Mariupol with further casualties in Kyiv overnight.An estimated m people have fled Ukraine since the invasion on February .

Storm Celia brought dust from the desert to southern parts of Spain, with Madrid and Murcia among the places lit up. But as the dust moved in on Monday, Laboratorio de Climatologia at the University of Alicante warned people against staying outside for long periods. They recommended the use of masks after Spanish officials issued extremely poor air quality ratings.In some parts, locals were told to avoid exercising altogether. The air change has also affected the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands. Experts have now warned itaposs making its way to the UK. BBC weather presenter Carol Kirkwood said the poor air quality could be felt in Britain as soon as Wednesday.There has been very poor air quality today in parts of Spain, and it could well affect us in the southeast and East Anglia on Wednesday, she said.  Previously, Dr Andy Whittamore - the clinical lead at Asthma UK - warned of the risks posed by Saharan dust. Toxic air can leave people struggling for breath and can cause wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and even a le-threatening asthma attack, he said. “Saharan dust could pose a serious risk to the . million people in the UK with asthma. Dust and other types of air pollution are a well-known trigger for people with asthma. “People with asthma must make sure they carry their reliever inhalerwith them at all times in case their symptoms worsen. We also advise people with asthma to continue to manage their condition with their preventer inhaleras this will help to reduce the inflammation in their airways and make them less likely to react to asthma triggers.

There are two types of this phenomenon.Type A calima refers to natural haze from sand, dust and other particles that come from the environment, whereas type B calima refers to the haze that comes as a result of pollution or ash from a forest fire for example.Some of Spainaposs larger cities struggle with poor air quality as a result of pollution, but the most striking episodes of calima come as a result of huge sand clouds from the Sahara blowing over to the Spanish territory - given Spain’s relative proximity with the .million square kilometre desert. Calima episodes tend to last between three and five days.A cloud of dust has also covered parts of Switzerland, giving it an unusual yellow glow, with the normally blue sky taking on an orange-brown hue. Extraordinary images have been shared on social media showing this strange phenomenon in the Swiss Alps.

walk on the wild side at its latest meeting as Argyll Estates# head stalker set his sights on an entertaining evening.Tom Kirsop provided society members with an informative and imaginative talk at their February gathering, covering his work and experiences on the local estate.Growing up in Clydebank, Tom had always had an interest in animals and moved to Argyll as a forest ranger in Dalmally.Since starting to work with Argyll Estates, which he thoroughly enjoys, Tom has been able to develop his work with animals in many dferent ways.In Queen Victoria’s time the current ,-acre estate was on an even bigger scale and has witnessed a huge increase in the number of deer since then.This has been due to the lack of any natural predators and, with further planting of trees since the s, the deer have had more protective covering.Modern inventions such as drones and the use of argocats, have made it easier for people working on estates to estimate numbers of deer more accurately and to be able to meet the necessary annual targets of keeping the deer population to manageable levels.Working on the estate also involves a range of other projects, such as collecting data on golden eagles, barn owls, making fishing available at the Glen Shira dam and taking clients out stalking.More recently Tom has started up West Highland Wildle Tours to give people of all ages a real insight into the wildle and beautul scenery on our doorstep.For the society#s March meeting, Ken MacTaggart will give a presentation about #The Medieval Pilgrim Way to Loch Awe#.The venue will be Inveraray church hall on Tuesday March , starting at .pm.Everyone is welcome.

MacKay converted for another two points and the score was  –  GHK.Having played with no subs, fatigue was starting to set in for the Argyll boys and with GHK using their subs they ran in a few more breakaway tries.Towards the end of the game GHK had one last attempt and broke through the Argyll defence, but from nowhere C Patterson found the determination and energy to chase the attacker down and fling out an arm to ankle tap him five metres short of the line and supporting was Lochlain Ellis to compete for the ball and earn Mid Argyll a deserved penalty.The final whistle sounded shortly after and the game finished  - to GHK.Mid Argyll enjoyed great hospitality from hosts GHK and Innes Patterson was awarded man of the match before the long journey home."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWhatever the rights and wrongs of Putin#s invasion of Ukraine, which has been shocking to witness from afar, one thing has shone through.The courage of the Ukranian people should serve as inspiration to each of us to stand against tyranny, in all its forms.As ever when the powerful invoke conflict, it#s the not-so-powerful and less wealthy who bear the brunt.

I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#.

the previous weekend through a flurry of late goals, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils took the lead within the opening minute.Captain Keith Mitchell’s ball down the left channel found winger Scott Souden, who cut inside and rounded the far-advanced St Peter’s goalkeeper, way out of his penalty area, and tucked the ball home low from around  yards.The first half was a well-contested affair, with chances at both ends, with the Pupils’ Lewis McNaughton and Donald McCallum both going close with efforts at goal, while at the other end, St Peter’s continued to probe for an equaliser.This arrived just a few minutes before half-time, albeit in rather fortuitous circumstances, when a low shot from the visitors’ centre-forward from just inside the box evaded the grasp of keeper Alasdair Ferguson.Early into the second half, the Pupils found themselves - down after St Peter’s converted a penalty kick, skipper Mitchell having been adjudged to have brought down an onrushing midfielder.Souden then had a good chance double his and the Feather-sponsored Pupils’ goal tally after meeting Ryan Deans’ fine cross from the right-hand side of the box, but he couldn’t guide his cushioned header on target.The Pupils played the last  minutes of the match with  men when Jamie Burns was sent off for a tackle which was not malicious but was late.In believing that a goal-scoring opportunity had been denied, despite the foul taking place at least  yards from goal, the referee decided to show the Pupils defender a red card.This numerical advantage eventually paid off for the visitors in the closing minutes as a long throw-in was flicked on into a gaping space inside the box where a St Peter’s midfielder calmly side-footed a low right-foot shot into the net beyond Ferguson.It was a painful defeat for the Pupils, who acquitted themselves very well during the match and enjoyed spells of possession and pressure during the game, and in front of another healthy home crowd.However, their more clinical visitors took their chances when they arrived and managed to keep at bay most Pupils attacks in the second half to take all three points from Kintyre.Tomorrow , the Pupils host Glenvale FC, another Paisley side, in league action.Kick off is pm at Kintyre Park.

Harbour for more than  years, catching a iety of shellfish such as lobster, brown crab and whelk.The fishing industry was one of the hardest hit by the compounded effects of Brexit and lockdown but the family-run business has managed to turn a potential hurdle into a success.Lawrie said: “When lockdown just kicked in, that was the end of the foreign markets.“We had been thinking about changing how we operate but that forced us.“We had it in our mind to start selling privately because of Brexit as well and it all just came together, and we’ve not really looked back.”Lawrie and Eddie have now shted their business to much more of a local focus, selling their catch to restaurants and the public in the local area while also offering a delivery service.Lawrie said: “Everything was shipped into Europe beforehand but now we are selling direct to restaurants mainly in Edinburgh and a few places in East Lothian.“Everything we catch gets sold within  miles so instead of shipping into France, Spain and wherever , it’s nice for us to see what the stuff that we catch is being used for.”In Scotland it is not illegal to catch egg-bearing lobsters, but Lawrie believes this is harmful for the long-term viability of the industry and promotes a far more sustainable model.“We see that as madness that we are taking away that stock for the future, so we’ve completely eliminated that and we don’t keep any egg bearing females at all, they go straight back in the sea, straight away,” he said.“The creels that we use are recycled plastics so in that respect we are more sustainable with the materials that we use.”Lawrie also added that they were looking into using electric vans to help reduce their carbon footprint, which has already been greatly reduced by their new local model.“Because we are selling locally, that’s food miles that’s being cut down as well,” he added.The new model has also allowed everyone at Belhaven Lobster to become more involved locally and reconnect with the community at a personal level.Lawrie said: “During the first lockdown, people were looking for things to get out of the house for, a reason to go and try something a bit dferent.“So when we were selling direct to the public, you got to speak to people, connect with people and get their story and what they were planning to do with the shellfish that we catch.“They were getting our side of the story as well, and they were interested to find out how we catch them and where we catch them.“It was good for the customers, good for us and I think it has benefited the harbour in general as well.”Archerfield House by Dirleton is one of the venues that Belhaven Lobster supplies, with executive chefs David Jamieson and Joe Queen dedicated to using locally sourced goods.Joe said: “It’s just a great company to deal with.“In all sorts of weather, we are guaranteed to get the product we are after and to deal with they are just great guys that want to look after the customers.“We wanted them involved because they are so good, they are friendly but it’s the consistency of the product.“We need it kept local we need it kept home.“There’s always a need, especially for shellfish, in any decent restaurant.“We have a great relationship now, and long may it continue.”While the Belhaven Lobster team are not sure where the future may take them, they are eager to keep growing and expanding.Lawrie said: “Hopefully we are going to keep going with what we are doing andwe can pick up more and more restaurants and customers then that’s great.“We can hopefully try and expand a little bit more and see where it takes us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"aberlady-plants-tree-jubilee","story":"Roderick Urquhart, Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, was joined by the youngest and oldest pupils at the village’s

The faculty heads meanwhile may only be qualied to teach one of the subjects for which they are responsible. This has meant a loss of crucial subject expertise and experience.In addition, the principal teachers, as key middle managers, played an absolutely vital part in the effective running of the school. I know from experience the value of the advice and guidance of the school’s principal teachers. I feel strongly that the loss of these posts cannot be helping the academic performance of Scotland’s secondary schools.Furthermore, as suggested in your article, the marked reduction in promoted posts in secondary schools seriously restricts career development for teachers and must be a disincentive for recruitment. When I started teaching there was a clear career structure for teachers as they moved from being a class teacher to a principal teacher, with assistant principal teacher posts created for the larger subject departments. For those teachers who wished to move into school leadership, the progression was from principal teacher to assistant head teacher, then to deputy head teacher before becoming a head teacher. This was a long apprenticeship which was a thorough preparation for the demanding job of head teacher. Compare this to the present structure where a teacher moves to the position of faculty head and then a deputy before being promoted to head teacher. This represents a signicant loss of opportunities for promotion as well as key stages in the preparation for headship.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh.GREEN INVESTMENT IS NOT A RACKETBRIAN Wilsonattempts to make the case against current land ownership in Scotland suggesting that the term \"laird\" should be confined to soap operas set in big houses awash with tartan. On that point we are in complete agreement. Laird is a hopelessly anachronistic term and does not reflect that the vast majority of landowners are today running rural businesses which strive to make a positive social, economic and environmental contribution to Scotland. Where we unfortunately part company is over the suggestion that investment in natural capital, or green investment, is some kind of \"racket\". To portray green investment as a \"racket\" being perpetrated by so-called ‘green lairds’fails to reflect reality on the ground.Private owners, whether they are families who have been around for generations or are an investment company new to landownership, are helping government to tackle climate change by increasing forestry cover, providing clean energy and restore peatlands to lock up carbon, as well as continuing to supply affordable rural housing, local jobs and produce world-class food and drink and tourism experiences.We should not fall into the trap of pitting one land use against another. Tackling climate change is of paramount importance and can be addressed in combination with other land uses.Mr Wilson is right, though, to point to the soaring price of land, which is an issue not just in Scotland.The foremost reason for land price inflation is the Chancellor’s response to the global financial crisis and the pandemic, which was to pump money into an economy which was in recession. This produced a spike in asset prices across the world, not just in land but pretty much across all asset classes.If we are to reach net zero, Scotland will necessarily see some new types of landowners, hopefully communities but also financial institutions. I hope that these institutions will all become members of Scottish Land  Estates and follow the standards of best practice in responsible landowning which our members practice across Scotland.Mark Tennant, Chairman, Scottish Land  Estates, Musselburgh.Could Queen Mary sink Waverley YOU report the possibleof TS Queen Mary to sailing again on the Clyde .One wondersthe potential market is sufficiently strong to successfully sustain two large pleasure craft at this location.

Lateral flow tests will also stop being freely available to the general population from April  Ms Sturgeon said this was “as far as we can go within funding constraints” following the UK Government’s decision to slash the budget for Covid testing, which had ballooned to £ billion a month by January. She said: “Our intention is that from end April all routine population-wide testing will end, including for those who have symptoms. “Contact tracing will end at this point too - although people with symptoms of respiratory illness will be advised to stay at home.“Physical test sites will close at the end of April - although mobile testing units and lab capacity will be retained for our longer term testing purposes.“We will do everything we can to support those who have worked on the testing programme during the transition. I want to thank all of them for their invaluable contribution over the last two years.“From  May, instead of a population wide approach, we will use testing on a targeted basis - to support clinical care and treatment and protect higher risk settings and for surveillance, outbreak management and responding to signicant developments, such as a new iant.“Let me stress that for any purpose for which we continue to advise testing, access to tests will, in Scotland, remain free of charge.”Ms Sturgeon said the current surge in infections has been driven by the BA. strain of Omicron, which now accounts for more than  per cent of cases in Scotland and is estimated to be around % more transmissible than the BA. lineage which first became dominant in December. : Is general practice about to face its biggest shake up in history of NHS This is putting “signicant pressure” on hospitals which are required to isolate Covid patients in separate wards - eventhey have mild or no symptoms - reducing the number of beds available for non-Covid care. NHS Lothian and NHS Grampian have more Covid patients now than at any time in the pandemic, while NHS Lanarkshire has warned that its three acute hospitals are operating beyond capacity.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde says its hospitals are also near capacity, while NHS Highland says some elective surgery is having to be cancelled.However, there is no evidence that BA. causes more severe disease and Ms Sturgeon noted that the recent rise in cases and hospital admissions “has not translated into a commensurate increase in cases of severe illness requiring intensive care”, adding that vaccines - much more so than Omicron being an “inherently milder” strain of Covid - meant that the “link between infection and serious health harm has weakened considerably”.There are currently  Covid patients in intensive care in Scotland. By contrast, Ms Sturgeon pointed to the current situation in Hong Kong “where relatively low rates of vaccination, particularly in the older population, mean that Omicron is causing very signicant levels of severe illness and death”. Hong Kong and New Zealand both pursued zero Covid policies, but % of over-s were unvaccinated when Omicron began spreading in Hong Kong compared to just % of over-s in New Zealand However - unlike New Zealand, where mortality remains low - Hong Kong failed to maximise vaccination coverage among its elderly.Two thirds of over-s were still unvaccinated against Covid when Omicron began spreading there in January - seeded by infected travellers and aircrew  who flouted quarantine. Hong Kong’s death rate per million over the past seven days is higher than that recorded by any other country at any point in the pandemic. Nearly one in every  confirmed cases population-wide is resulting in a death.In comparison, analysis in England suggests that a combination of vaccine protection, natural immunity and Omicron means that, for the UK, Covid is now less lethal than flu.“This underlines the vital importance of vaccination,” said Ms Sturgeon, as she confirmed that ‘second boosters’ will be rolled out to all over-s starting next week.Elderly care home residents began receiving theirs last week.  "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-urged-follow-suit-westminster-announces-legal-aid-funding-boost","story":"The UK Government announced plans for £ million in additional legal aid funding on Tuesday following an independent review of the system.The Law Society of Scotland is now calling for Scottish ministers to follow suit in a bid to resolve the mounting legal aid problem north of the border.Lawyers have long been calling for a substantial increase in funding, with solicitors staging protest action at courts across the country in recent months.The Scottish Government last week announced that it would provide a “signicant increase” in fees, but this was quickly shot down by lawyers who said the “small uplt” barely covered the recent increase in inflation.Following the Westminster funding announcement, Ian Moir, Law Society criminal legal aid convener, said: “The UK Government has recognised that legal aid in England and Wales needs signicant additional resource.  After a decade of underfunding, the Scottish Government needs to follow suit otherwise we risk deepening the access to justice crisis that is already affecting the most vulnerable in our society.“The issues south of the border mirror those we currently face in Scotland.” He added: “In Scotland, we are four years on from an independent review of legal aid, and almost a year on from a fee  project that recommended further research.

It will be reviewed again in two weeks’ time.The law on masks, which applies to public transport and enclosed public spaces, was due to be converted to guidance on March .However, the legal requirement for certain premises to retain customer contact details will be dropped as planned.The decision comes as the spike in cases means that one in  Scots have Covid.The First Minister said: “Given the current spike in case numbers, we consider it prudent to retain this requirement in regulation for a further short period.“I know this will be disappointing for businesses and service providers such as day care services.“However, ensuring continued widespread use of face coverings will provide some additional protection – particularly for the most vulnerable – at a time when the risk of infection is very high, and it may help us get over this spike more quickly.”However, the requirement for businesses to collect customer details for track and trace purposes will be lted on Monday. Ms Sturgeon said that the Scottish Government “reluctantly agreed” to lt all international travel restrictions for Scotland this week at a four-nation meeting on Monday.From am on Friday, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer be required to complete passenger locator forms under the change.Non-vaccinated travellers will cease having to take pre-departure and day two PCR tests, or complete locator forms.The changes will only apply to incoming travellers, and passengers should continue to check gov.uk for the latest information on requirements in other countries when travelling abroad.The transition period for coronavirus testing in Scotland will continue until the end of April, Nicola Sturgeon has said.The First Minister said “this is as far as we can go within funding constraints”, taking account of current case numbers.She said she was aiming for the same “long-term position as England”.Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament: “For the next month – until Easter – there will be no change to our testing advice.“If you don’t have symptoms, you should continue for now to use a lateral flow test twice weekly daily for seven daysyou are a close contact of a positive case and before visiting someone who is vulnerable.“If you have symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test, either at a testing site or by post.“However, following the Easter weekend – from April  – we will no longer advise people without symptoms to test twice weekly.”She said that until the end of April, the Government will continue to advise those with symptoms to get a PCR test.Contact testing will end at the end on April  and physical Covid testing sites will close at the end of April.Ms Sturgeon continued: “From May , instead of a population-wide approach, we will use testing on a targeted basis – to support clinical care and treatment and protect higher risk settings and for surveillance, outbreak management and responding to signicant developments, such as a new iant.” "},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"March ,  at : pmFace coverings are to continue to be worn on public transport and most indoor public settings until at least early April, after the Scottish Government rowed back on plans to lt the legal restrictions on mask wearing.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s incredibly complicated to put a sanction in place at short notice and that will all need working through.“I think the end-state will be something where the Government lends a licence to allow fans to go to games. I think that hasn’t been possible in time for this weekend.“What Cha are going to do is appeal to the FA Cup committee and that will take a view on what should happen.

If the European Commission gives approval, it is expected to break ground next year and come online by , creating , high-tech jobs.The plans also call for  billion eurosto expand Intel’s existing site in Leixlip, Ireland, by doubling manufacturing space and expanding its new foundry services business, to build chips designed by other firms. That will bring the company’s total Irish investment to more than  billion euros Intel says it is also in talks with Italy “to enable a state-of-the-art back-end manufacturing facility” that would involve potential investment of up to . billion eurosand create thousands of direct and indirect jobs.There are also plans for a research and development hub and a foundry design centre in France, expanded lab space in Poland and to team up with local researchers for an advanced computing lab in Spain."},{"url":null,"title":"parts-viable-explosive-devices-found-londonderry  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The shelling ignited a huge fire in a -storey apartment building and spurred a frantic rescue effort.The strikes on the th day of Russia’s invasion targeted a western district of Kyiv, disrupting a relative calm that had ed after an initial advance by Moscow’s forces was stopped in the early days of the war.A senior US defence source said the Russians were using long-range fire to hit civilian targets within Kyiv with increasing frequency but that their ground forces were making little to no progress around the country. The official said Russian forces were still about nine miles from the centre of Kyiv.Ukrainian presidential aide Ihor Zhovkva said Russia has stopped airing demands for Ukraine to surrender, and the Ukrainian representatives felt “moderately optimistic” after the latest talks. Discussions are expected to continue tomorrow.In a statement that seemed to signal potential grounds for agreement with Moscow, Mr Zelensky told European leaders gathered in London that he realises Nato has no intention of accepting Ukraine. vw,vw,px, px\"“We have heard for many years about the open doors, but we also heard that we can’t enter those doors,” he said. “This is the truth, and we have simply to accept it as it is.”Nato does not admit nations with unsettled territorial conflicts.The UN said close to  civilians in Ukraine have been confirmed killed, but the true figure is probably much higher.The leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia travelled to Kyiv by train despite the security risks, in a visit EU officials said was not sanctioned by other members of the -nation bloc.“The aim of the visit is to express the European Union’s unequivocal support for Ukraine and its freedom and independence,” Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said in a tweet.He was joined by fellow Janez Jansa of Slovenia and Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland, as well as Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Poland’s de facto leader. vw,vw,px, px\"Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in a tweet that the leaders had arrived, lauding “the courage of true friends”. He said they were discussing support for Ukraine and further sanctions against Russia.New efforts to take civilians to safety and deliver aid were under way around the country. The Red Cross said it was working to evacuate people from the north-eastern town of Sumy, near the Russian border, in about  buses.One of the most desperate situations is in Mariupol, the southern city of , where officials say a weeks-long siege has killed more than , people and left residents struggling for food, water, heat and medicine.Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a deputy head of Mr Zelensky’s office, said that  out of about , vehicles that left Mariupol have reached the city of Zaporizhzhia,  miles to the north west, while others will spend the night in towns along the way.Fighting has intensied on Kyiv’s outskirts in recent days, and air raid sirens wailed inside the capital. Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced a -hour curfew extending until Thursday morning.Tuesday’s artillery strikes hit the Svyatoshynskyi district of western Kyiv, adjacent to the suburb of Irpin, which has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.Flames shot out of the -storey apartment building and smoke choked the air as firefighters climbed ladders to rescue people. The assault blackened several floors of the building, ripped a hole in the ground outside and blew out windows in neighbouring apartment blocks. Rescue workers said at least one person was killed.A -storey apartment building in the Podilsky district of Kyiv, north of the government quarter, was damaged. Russian forces also stepped up strikes overnight on Irpin and the north-west Kyiv suburbs of Hostomel and Bucha, said the head of the capital region, Oleksiy Kuleba.“Many streets have been turned into a mush of steel and concrete. People have been hiding for weeks in basements, and are afraid to go out even for evacuations,” he said on Ukrainian television.In the east, Russian forces launched more than  strikes overnight on Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, according to regional administration chief Oleh Sinehubov. The strikes hit the city’s historical centre, including the main marketplace.Ukraine’s parliament voted to extend martial law for another month, until April .

These orders include  Zero Emission Buses which will soon be on our roads.Minister Mallon said: “I am committed to delivering cleaner, greener, sustainable infrastructure. I have been clear that tackling the climate crisis is a priority for me and I am committed to building a better future where we make zero low emission public transport accessible to communities across the North. My efforts are focused on making public transport carbon net zero as quickly as possible by delivering a step change on this journey to a greener future. “This is a future where our public transport leaves behind a reduced carbon footprint on our planet and where the air we breathe is cleaner as we tackle the climate crisis rather than exacerbate it.“In line with this commitment I previously allocated funding of almost poundmillion for the purchase of  zero and low emission buses for the Translink fleet. The first of these are due to go into passenger service in the next few weeks which will be another exciting milestone on this journey to net zero. When all the buses arrive and are in service Translink will have the fourth largest fleet across these islands of zero emission buses.“In November I was also delighted to announce additional funding of poundmillion for the purchase of  new zero emission battery electric buses for the Foylefleet. “This signicant leap will see the city’s entire urban fleet replaced with electric buses making it one of the first cities across these islands to have a fully zero-emission bus fleet when all the vehicles go into passenger service in .“Wrightbus are delivering both these signicant projects for us so I am delighted to be here today to see at first hand the expertise and technology they use and to meet with the staff helping us drive forward cleaner, greener public transport across the North for now and for future generations.” "},{"url":null,"title":"is northern ireland on track to reach its climate change targets","story":"The road to net zero is littered with obstacles as political parties lock horns over a ban on smoky coal and other environmental issues.

It means that methane emissions for  are not required to be more than % lower than the  baseline. The law now needs to be implemented.Read MoreAssembly passes climate Bill committing Northern Ireland to net zero by Tree coverageNorthern Ireland ranks badly as one of the least-wooded regions in Europe, with just % woodland cover compared with the European average of %. In addition, almost % of our woodland is in the form of recent coner plantations.The Woodland Trust said Northern Ireland needs to signicantly increase tree plantingit is to help towards a UK woodland target.The conservation charity previously published its Emergency Tree Plan. The plan sets out how the UK can rapidly increase tree cover to help reach net zero carbon emissions and tackle the declines in wildle.Northern Ireland would need to plant , hectares of trees a year to hit an existing target of % cover by . To contribute to this, the Forests For our Future Programme announced by Mr Poots in March  set targets to create , hectares of new woodland by , which falls well short of those recommended by the Woodland Trust.The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas a woodland expansion target  hectares for  .Ammonia emissionsAmmonia is an air pollutant largely emitted from agriculture and has a damaging impact on bioersity, including sensitive habitats, as well as human health. It is produced by many common farming activities, such as the housing of livestock, the storage and spreading of manure and slurries, and the application of fertiliser.An Audit Office report from February found that most areas of Northern Ireland, including designated sites and other priority habitats, are affected by high levels of nitrogen being deposited on land and into water surfaces.The levels in most areas are signicantly above what is considered their “critical load”, the concentration of nitrogen at which signicant ecological damage occurs. Northern Ireland is responsible for % of UK ammonia emissions, despite only having % of its population and % of its land area, and is the only region of the UK where ammonia levels have not been decreasing.“Failure to address the increasing level of ammonia emissions also has the potential to contribute to serious, long-term harm to the environment and human health,” the report concluded.Mr Poots has conceded that a failure to publish an Ammonia Reduction Strategywill be a regret when he leaves office and it is one that has left the department vulnerable to legal challenge. However, he stresses that he wants to publish a strategy before leaving office.Independent Environmental Protection AgencyUnder an outline programme for government in the New Decade, New Approach, a number of coordinated measures to reverse climate change were laid out.They included an Independent Environmental Protection Agencyto oversee targets that would be set as part of climate change legislation.Mr Poots is opposed to the establishment of an IEPA, believing it to be unnecessary bureaucracy. However, he has proposed setting up an office of environmental protection to do similar independent work.Conservation Management PlansNorthern Ireland is home to important nature and wildle, of both national and international importance, which are a key part of the Northern Ireland landscape, providing a wide range of goods and services to society and helping to deal with climate change.The UK faced formal infringement proceedings by the European Commission because of the failure to have in place Conservation Management Plansfor its European sites.There are  special areas of conservation and  special protection areas in Northern Ireland. Strangford Lough and Rathlin Island were reported to the commission as having a CMP in place.That leaves  sites without such plans in Northern Ireland.At the time of the infraction proceedings it was reported to the Commission Rathlin Island and Strangford Lough had Conservation Management Plansin place.The Commission took the view that developing CMPs for each of the remaining SACs would signicantly contribute to addressing the alleged failings to comply with the obligations under the Habitats Directive.DAERA subsequently embarked on a signicant programme of work to develop such CMPs to date draft CMPs have been developed for  of the SAC sites, with the intention to have draft plans for all SACs completed by December .Clear AirAir pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, and the fourth greatest threat to public health after cancer, heart disease and obesity.The Clean Air Strategy, published in January  by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs , sets out a number of objectives to improve air quality across the UK.Additionally, DAERA issued a Clean Air Strategy for Northern Ireland Discussion Document for public consideration in November . The period of public discussion closed in early .This strategy aims to build on existing improvements within Northern Ireland and seeks to tackle important cross-Departmental issues relating to transport, energy, agriculture, industry, local air quality management, and communications.An air quality strategy was anticipated but has not been published. Minister Poots says that recommendations await the next office holder.Mobuoy super dumpAt public meetings, government officials have been repeatedly challenged to urgently deal with an estimated one million cubic metres of waste at the Mobuoy “super dump” on the outskirts of Derry. The River Faughan which forms the western boundary of the site supplies the city with % of its drinking water.Ongoing legal action has been blamed for delaying remediation work at the site. That trial is due to commence next month.The clean-up cost at Mobuoy has been estimated at a minimum of £ million — and potentially as much as £ million.NI Water and DAERA have always assured the public that chemicals present in drinking water are at safe levels. However, campaigners contend there are “no safe levels” of arsenic or manganese as exposure to such chemicals can have a long-term damaging effect on the brain.It is expected that based on successful approval of a business case, a remediation contractor will be appointed by late .Ban on petroleum licensingIn a somewhat unexpected move, the DUP Economy Minister, Gordon Lyons, announced that he would support a ban on fracking and onshore petroleum licensing activity in Northern Ireland.Fracking is broadly banned across the UK and Ireland. In England, the Government told the industry it would not agree to any future fracking “until compelling new evidence is provided” that it was safe.Two petroleum licensing applications in NI relate to Fermanagh, where a company called Tamboran Resources UK applied for a licence in .A separate application from EHA Exploration takes in five council areas: Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Mid Ulster.However, Sinn Fein said it is “bitterly disappointing” that as a result of the DUP collapsing the Executive, that ban cannot now be brought forward.Water pollutionA recent ‘Water Framework Directive Statistics Report’ determined that none of Northern Ireland’s  rivers, lakes and coastal waters achieved a “good overall status” rating for water quality.Environmentalists have argued that minimal fines handed down for water pollution do not act as an appropriate deterrent for repeat offenders.Figures obtained by Green Party MLA Rachel Woods showed that more than seven million tonnes of raw sewage is being dumped into Northern Ireland’s seas and rivers every year.NI Water requires investment of around £bn in water and wastewater services over a six year period, the Utility Regulator said in May. This financial year the DfI Minister allocated a combined budget £m to NI Water for  .Coal banSmoky coal is one of the worst causes of air pollution. It has been reported that approximately , premature deaths have been averted in Dublin since the introduction of a coal ban back in . In the past, DUP MP Sammy Wilson strongly opposed proposals saying that low-income households who use cheap coal would be adversely affected as smokeless coal costs more.In response, then Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said: “It is great to hear Saint Sammy, defender of the disadvantaged — I do not know what happened to Sammy, the champion of the Tory cuts — make all these arguments on behalf of those suffering fuel poverty.“There is not a word about the big business interests of those in the coal business or, indeed, the interests of Larne port in his own constituency.”DUP MLA Michelle McIlveen, who was DAERA Minister before the Assembly collapsed, also said it was not her intention to ban smoky coal in the North.Now, Mr Poots, says he has no intention of banning coal because people would “die of hypothermia” in homes that are not properly insulated.Most ReadUUP leader ‘too unwell’ to attend St Patrick’s Day events in WashingtonIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreLoyalist drug dealer fled crash with bags of cocaine but left girlfriend behindTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest EnvironmentUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontStormont crisis ‘farcical and very damaging’ – Green Party leader easy ways to ‘green-proof’ your home that won’t cost the earth and will reduce your billsSam McBrideOpinionBasic, inexcusable failures mean that recyclable items are being dumpedAsk the experts: Pollution charges to cut congestionLatestChair of International Booker Prize judging  calls for translator royalties‘I was watching mums and babies being slaughtered… I needed to do something’ – kind-hearted NI woman offers spare room to Ukrainian refugeeTributes paid to Irish journalist and cameraman killed in UkraineLong delays for major planning applications ‘costing jobs and prosperity’Three EU premiers visit Kyiv as Russia steps up bombardment of capital,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Our direct competitors in the Republic of Ireland are dealing with such signicant applications much more efficiently. This is a major consideration for companies deciding where to invest.”Alliance MLA Andrew Muir said the delays point to a “systemic problem” at the heart of DfI, which “ought to be leading as a role model in planning matters, but instead is more like a black hole where key planning applications disappear for determination to be delayed for years”.“Nothing less than radical reform is needed to ensure the voices of communities are better heard and applications not left sitting stuck in the system without a decision to reject or approve,” he added.DfI said: “The department is working closely with key stakeholders in a number of ways to improve processes and increase the efficiency of the planning system to ensure that planning applications are processed in a timely manner. “A review of the implementation of the Planning Act has been completed. In addition, the department, as part of a collaborative project with  councils, will be delivering a new planning IT system next year which will improve the submission and processing of planning applications.“A planning engagement partnership has also been established to look at how to enhance the quality and depth of community engagement in the planning process at both the regional and local planning levels.“It is hoped that the collective improvements delivered from this work will improve processes and increase the efficiency of the planning system across the board.”Related topicsAndrew MuirDepartment for InfrastructureNichola MallonMore On Andrew MuirAlliance MLAs believe recorded vote was required for key climate bill amendmentMost NI schools have not had to move to remote learning despite Covid-related absences, says Education Minister PremiumBids for extra funding for Northern Ireland road repairs hit -year low PremiumViewpointOpinionSkimping on road repairs must stopDUP is slammed over £m of extra funding now ‘in limbo’Most ReadUUP leader ‘too unwell’ to attend St Patrick’s Day events in WashingtonIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreLoyalist drug dealer fled crash with bags of cocaine but left girlfriend behindTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest Northern Ireland‘I was watching mums and babies being slaughtered… I needed to do something’ – kind-hearted NI woman offers spare room to Ukrainian refugeeParts of viable explosive devices found in LondonderrySt Patrick’s Day: Everything you need to know about the weather forecast and travel arrangementsMentally ill man who killed his grandmother fearing ‘she was turning into a zombie’ jailedWhat are the coronavirus rules in the four UK nations Latest‘I was watching mums and babies being slaughtered… I needed to do something’ – kind-hearted NI woman offers spare room to Ukrainian refugeeTributes paid to Irish journalist and cameraman killed in UkraineThree EU premiers visit Kyiv as Russia steps up bombardment of capitalSaqib Mahmood to make long-awaited Test debut for England against West IndiesParts of viable explosive devices found in Londonderry,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurneySam McBrideTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe new head of the Civil Service has declined to say whether it is acceptable for a Stormont department to attempt to overturn a judicial finding that a civil servant was driven from her job after she blew the whistle on potential fraud and animal suffering.Last week the Belfastrevealed the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswas using taxpayers’ money to attempt to overturn a devastating judgment that raised serious concerns about Northern Ireland’s chief vet and one of his deputies.Six months ago an employment tribunal unanimously found that Tamara Bronckaers, a senior DAERA vet with an “exemplary performance and record”, had been constructively sacked because she blew the whistle.The case has major implications for the treatment of Civil Service whistleblowers, the welfare of animals, the spread of disease, and the reputation of the cattle traceability system which, since the BSE crisis, has been central to how the agriculture industry has marketed local beef.The public could be forced to pay £m to compensate her, along with huge legal bills.In a ,-word judgment, Employment Judge Ó Murray repeatedly criticised the whistleblower’s treatment by two of her senior colleagues — line manager Julian Henderson and chief vet Robert Huey.At the heart of the case was Dr Bronckaers’ desire to pursue enforcement action against Ballymena Livestock Market over alleged suffering caused to animals, and animal movements being electronically deleted.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Dr Huey told her he knew the manager of the market personally and also its chairman. Both he and Dr Henderson discouraged her from pursuing enforcement, with Dr Bronckaers left in tears after an encounter with Dr Huey. Both men remain in post, while Dr Bronckaers does not. The Belfastasked Dr Bradyas head of the Civil Service she had anything to say about whether, on her watch, this will be acceptable, and whether she has any message to other whistleblowers.In response the Executive Office, within which the head of the Civil Service sits, responded: “It is not appropriate to comment on an ongoing legal issue which is a matter for DAERA.”Dr Brady, who was brought in from Belfast City Council, was appointed last year.Three months ago she told an Assembly committee that one of her key priorities was to deliver the recommendations of the RHI Inquiry, and said “of course we’re all aware of the whistleblowing legislation”.There was no suggestion that Dr Bronckaers was anything other than genuine, and the Civil Service handbook makes clear that whistleblowers should be encouraged.It states that the organisation “encourages staff to raise issues of concern internally to provide an opportunity to have such matters investigated and addressed as appropriate. Reasonable belief that wrongdoing has taken place is sufficient justication… It will always be assumed that concerns have been raised in good faith unless there is evidence to the contrary”.It adds that officials “should not suffer any detriment or harassment as a result.”If DAERA loses its appeal, taxpayers will fund Dr Bronckaers’ compensation, which could be as much as £m, plus hefty legal bills.Related topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblyDepartment of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - The Executive OfficeMore On Northern Ireland AssemblyIntegrated Education Bill is shameful, claims DUP’s Edwin Poots PremiumMLAs who tried to cut rents will actually force them up, claims estate agents’ body PremiumUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeUUP’s Beattie urges NI households to take part in Ukrainian refugee scheme launched on Monday PremiumSam McBrideOpinionJeffrey Donaldson has turned down three vacant MLA seats since becoming DUP leader, and may neverto StormontMost ReadUUP leader ‘too unwell’ to attend St Patrick’s Day events in WashingtonIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreLoyalist drug dealer fled crash with bags of cocaine but left girlfriend behindTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest PoliticsUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontMLAs who tried to cut rents will actually force them up, claims estate agents’ bodyBelfast taxi driver fears any rise in fares could drive customers awayUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeAllison MorrisOpinionNI Protocol must go on backburner while heating crisis is hereLatest‘I was watching mums and babies being slaughtered… I needed to do something’ – kind-hearted NI woman offers spare room to Ukrainian refugeeTributes paid to Irish journalist and cameraman killed in UkraineLong delays for major planning applications ‘costing jobs and prosperity’Three EU premiers visit Kyiv as Russia steps up bombardment of capitalSaqib Mahmood to make long-awaited Test debut for England against West Indies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireSam McBrideTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailStormont is on course to waste at least £m — and perhaps as much as £m — over the next  years due to its failure to find a way to spend Treasury funding made available to Northern Ireland for subsidising renewable heat.As revealed by the Belfastlast week, £m has already been wasted in this way and there is no sign of the Department for the Economy producing an alternative proposal for how it can spend the money.However, new figures show the vast scale of the waste aheadthe situation remains unaltered. In response to a Freedom of Information request from the Renewable Heat Association— which represents most RHI claimants — the department said that it was now on course to underspend by around £m. However, those figures only cover expenditure until , yet the GB RHI scheme — from whose budget Northern Ireland’s share of money for renewable heat is derived — has been extended and will not now close until .Based on that longer duration for the GB scheme, RHANI has calculated that Northern Ireland’s underspend may be closer to £m.Read MoreCriticism as Queen’s University Belfast ‘spends over £k’ on Amazon during pandemicThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidiesThe department said that it “will explore the potential to utilise any available [Treasury] funds in support of alternative or additional actions to decarbonise heat”. However, there is still no suggestion that this work has reached an advanced stage nor even that it will be possible because the Executive remains unable to decide how to handle existing RHI claimants.Those claimants were promised unalterable payments for  years but once the calamitous scale of the RHI overspend became apparent, Stormont abandoned that promise and retrospectively slashed their payments, meaning the actual overspend was £.m.That decision made them far less well rewarded than their counterparts in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland, which recently launched its own version of RHI — putting Northern Irish businesses at a competitive disadvantage.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Sources within the DUP suggest that the party is split on how to handle the situation. Former leader Arlene Foster — the minister who set up the disastrous scheme but then said she was “accountable but not responsible” for the mess which followed — had endorsed a policy of throwing all RHI claimants out of the scheme, paying them a fraction of what they were originally promised as compensation. Sinn Fein has also endorsed this policy, but other DUP figures believe it is unfair to those claimants who entered the scheme in good faith, took on huge loans at the suggestion of its minister and government officials, and who did not abuse RHI.There is another factor which might explain the decision not to spend such a vast sum of money. The retrospective cuts to subsidies which had been guaranteed were immediately challenged in court by claimants. However, that process has moved tortoise-like over the last five years and has not yet gone to the Supreme Court. That case is just one of several RHI legal actions, the outcome of which the department cannot be certain.It may be that its decision not to launch a new green heat scheme is a way of hedging against the possibility that the original scheme is reinstated and it faces a vast compensation bill.Whatever the reason, it is having an increasingly stark impact. As oil and gas prices soar, renewables are among the cheapest alternatives — but have high up-front costs to install, which is why subsidies are in place where across the UK and Ireland.RHANI executive chairman Andrew Trimble said: “If civil servants had not removed  words from the national legislation on renewable heat when the NI legislation was implemented, then today we would have a strong, sustainable, environmentally friendly renewable heat sector. We would be contributing to our pathway to net zero and have a vastly reduced reliance on fossil fuels — with their polluting emissions reduced by %.”He said that Stormont could solve the problem by reinstating the missing  words — essentially replicating the GB scheme, with cost controls, something he said “could solve the political problems that Stormont and the department have created for themselves and for the people of Northern Ireland”.Mr Trimble highlighted that in , a Commons committee inquiry branded the department’s actions “a raw deal”, but the department had repeatedly failed to help genuine claimants suffering as a result of their broken promises.Related topicsDepartment for the EconomyThe Executive OfficeArlene FosterSinn FéinClimate ChangeMore On Department for the Economy‘No plans’ to ration NI’s energy over supply fearsDepartment​​ of Economy slammed over Covid spend PremiumEpidemic Belfast: Podcast takes a scalpel to our medical pastCost of living crisis leads to .% slump in retail footfall PremiumEconomy is being distorted by Invest NI focusing on Belfast, claims MLAMost ReadUUP leader ‘too unwell’ to attend St Patrick’s Day events in WashingtonIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreLoyalist drug dealer fled crash with bags of cocaine but left girlfriend behindTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayVideo: Police come under attack while dealing with suspected pipe bombs in Derry PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest PoliticsMLAs who tried to cut rents will actually force them up, claims estate agents’ bodyNew Civil Service chief silent over whistleblower caseBelfast taxi driver fears any rise in fares could drive customers awayUkraine: Northern Ireland politicians urge public to help home refugees as two leaders confirm they will sign up to schemeAllison MorrisOpinionNI Protocol must go on backburner while heating crisis is hereLatestChair of International Booker Prize judging  calls for translator royalties‘I was watching mums and babies being slaughtered… I needed to do something’ – kind-hearted NI woman offers spare room to Ukrainian refugeeTributes paid to Irish journalist and cameraman killed in UkraineLong delays for major planning applications ‘costing jobs and prosperity’Three EU premiers visit Kyiv as Russia steps up bombardment of capital,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He asked that that all Mournes area councillors are consulted before anything is agreed for this summer in Newcastle.ldquoThere is a substantial amount of money available and Mournes councillors should have a massive say in what happens in Newcastle this year, he added, with his suggestion backed by Cllr Leeanne McEvoy.Cllr Owen proposed that a firm commitment should be made to include the Festival of Flight in the councilrsquos events calendar for next year.She said she had been contacted by a number of business owners and aviation enthusiasts who were concerned that this yearrsquos festival had been cancelled and hoped that it will proceed next summer.Council deputy chief executive Dorinnia Carville said it would be would be premature to determine the events programme for   ahead of finding out how much it would cost.The council official said the organisation had to go through the rates process each year and look at budgets thereafter.Several weeks ago, it was confirmed that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight would not go ahead due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the coronavirus pandemic.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and was also grounded in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down on the Farm book shows importance of museum collections detailing rich history  ","story":"lsquoI SAW the man jump out of the group and grasp the handles of the plough.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July. It will replace the townrsquos previous mart which closed two years ago.However, the mart is part of a much larger project which includes plans for animal processing facilities, a conference centre and extensive retailing outlets.Mr Hugh Linehan, chairman of the co-operative, says it will be the most advanced project of its kind in Northern Ireland and will bring jobs and wealth to the area.ldquoWe see this as the way ahead for local agriculture, Mr Linehan said yesterday.Funding for the mart phase is largely complete.

With that acceptance not forthcoming, the money is no longer guaranteed and a fresh bid for funding will have to be made.ARDGLASS ndash A Government minister has been challenged to sanction the ldquospending of buttons to end more than  years of misery for the residents of an Ardglass housing estate.Ardglass SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said yesterday he has written to Stormont Minster Jeremy Hanley demanding immediate action to solve the problems associated with Mill River adjacent to the villagersquos Seaview housing estate.ldquoI have submitted a full dossier on the history of long delay in resolving this problem, explained Mr Curran.ldquoSince  I have been asking for the culverting of this river.

The gates will be replaced with a perforated double metal gate.Planners say the removal of the ldquobulky rear extension to the existing listed building can only be seen as a betterment to its integrity and intrinsic character ldquo.In addition, they say the demolition proposal does not ldquooffend the essential character of the building with its setting retained and its features of special interest remaining intact and unimpaired.Planners have also stipulated that any proposed demolition work proposed within one metre of the Newcastle Centre shall be carried out by hand and that no power tools must be used to ensure no damage to the existing building.The proposed new leisure complex will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.Itrsquos also understood that the eagerly-awaited new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which enjoys protected status, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Late last year, it was revealed that an economist and team of expert consultants would be appointed to design the new leisure facility, with Newry, Mourne and Down Council adding an additional pound, to its capital programme to help deliver the new complex.The planned investment at the current Newcastle Centre housed in the Annesley Buildings is also a key plank of the local authorityrsquos capital investment programme.Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, said it was well known that Newcastle ldquoneeds and deserves a fit-for-purpose leisure centre.She said while the local authority has faced many hurdles over recent years in delivering a new leisure complex, all Mournes councillors understand there are no longer any available sites within the town which are of a suitable size to build what is needed.But Cllr Devlin said this could not be used as an excuse, highlighting the need to deliver for the people of town and visitors.ldquoThe council is proceeding with plans for a replacement centre on the current Newcastle Centre site, she continued. ldquoFrom the outset of this process I have said that this must include a pool and that remains my position.ldquoI appreciate there are swimming pools within the district butwe are serious about tourism we need to look at a rainy day offering in Newcastle and I believe that a pool would tick that box, as well as providing a superb facility for our local community.Cllr Devlin said she looks forward to forward to seeing the outline business case and the eagerly-awaited project progressing at long last.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely fashion.Two sites were previously identied for the new centre, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.

The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

Politically the situation is much more complicated in the eastern part of Ukraine. People in the eastern part of the country are very Russian. But % of the people in the Ukraine donrsquot care about politics and just what a happy, peaceful le.Mr Johnston described the now impractical steps his relatives which have to taken in order to get a visa.ldquoThey would normally have to travel  hours on an overnight train from Mariupol to Kyiv to get a visa granted for travel. In the current situation that is just not possible, he said.ldquoThe only way for people to get out is through the only UK embassy open in Lviv and how are people are meant top get there when they canrsquot leave their own towns without the risk of being bombed Mr Johnston added that he and his we and their children, Liza and Jamie, were frustrated that their family members could be just one plane flight away from safetythey could get the necessary visa, orthat could be waived in the urgent circumstances.He said: ldquoWe are worried aboutthe possibility of Alexander being coned to fight and we are getting reports that landmines have been set around the city.ldquoWhile we are all worried, Iryna has been remarkable throughout all of this and has been really strong but we feel that there is very little we can do.Mr Johnston said that they were in despair of the UKrsquos stance in welcoming Ukrainian refugees but still making them apply for visas.ldquoThe south of Ireland opened up to refugees visa-free which is great but that means we still couldnrsquot bring them to our home as they would be in UK territory.He and his family visited Mariupol for six weeks last summer as it has already proved dficult for his mother-in-law to get a visa to travel to them.ldquoMariupol is such a beautul city. They had spent so much money on the city and now itrsquos ruined.The couple met in Ukraine while Mr Johnston, a flutist, was performing in cruise ships and his we was a concert pianist.To sign the petition to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees coming into the UK visit https:petition.parliament.uk petitions ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":null,"title":"latest","story":"Undefined component: AdRowTaboolaPolitics Transgenderism: SDLP quietly U-turns on free tampon bill to include women Adam KulaCrime Four lorries destroyed in late night arson attack Gemma MurrayPeople Here are the cheapest places to buy diesel and petrol in NI Sarah McCann, Search and Trends WriterPolitics DUP councillor Paul Rankin co-opted to Lagan Valley Assembly seat PA Reporter\" layout\"fill\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMTIzODQ.jpg crop:,smartwidth w\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fill i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"fill\"People Applications to open for Northern Ireland residents to host Ukrainians By The NewsroomPeople Funeral on Tuesday for Samuel Crawford, who died in Ben Nevis climbing accident Niall Deeney Crime Former Kincora resident vows to pursue legal action over sex abuse claims By The NewsroomPolitics NI Protocol: Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allister reject taoiseach’s claims By The NewsroomCrime Man stabbed multiple times after ‘argument broke out’ Gemma MurrayNews Appeal to find missing teen last seen wear pink top and leggings Gemma MurrayPolitics TUV conference: RAF veteran Lorna Smyth confident of success in Lagan Valley By The Newsroom\" layout\"fill\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMDYNzky.jpg crop:,smartwidth w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMDYNzky.jpg crop:,smartwidth w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMDYNzky.jpg crop:,smartwidth w\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fill i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"fill\"News First refugees under new scheme could arrive in UK in week’s time By The NewsroomPolitics International Fund for Ireland has plan for ‘family-friendly and shared’ cultura...

Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityChief executive Pat Gelsinger said Intel was investing the money over the next decade “along the entire semiconductor value chain”.The company plans to spend tens of billions setting up or expanding chip production sites and establishing research and development or design centres in Germany, Ireland, France and Italy.“Why are we doing this  Because the world has an insatiable demand for semiconductors, or chips,” Mr Gelsinger said in a webcast.A gt€ billion investment announced today marks a “Silicon Junction” for advanced #chipmaking. @Intel will bring its most advanced #tech to Europe to help create a world-class #semiconductor ecosystem. https:t.co iTpqjBxup #IntelEurope #Manufacturing pic zqgYzxGG— IntelMarch , Intel said it is bringing its most advanced technology to Europe to address the need for a “more balanced and resilient” semiconductor supply chain.European Union leaders last month announced a  billion dollarChips Act to help the continent become a major semiconductor producer and curb its dependency on Asian markets for the tiny components, which act as the electronic brains for everything from cars to smartphones and game consoles.Demand for chips has surged as the global economy bounced back from the Covid- pandemic, but supply has not kept up because of bottlenecks.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen hailed the announcement as the first major achievement under the EU Chips Act.“I’m sure it will pave the way for more companies to follow suit,” said Ms von der Leyen, who wants the EU to double its share of global chip production to % by . vw,vw,px, px\"Ursula von der Leyen .removeThe first phase of Intel’s investment plans include  billion eurosto beef up its European production capacity with a leading-edge semiconductor “mega-site” in Magdeburg, Germany.The site will include two semiconductor factories that will make chips with Intel’s most advanced technology. If the European Commission gives approval, it is expected to break ground next year and come online by , creating , high-tech jobs.The plans also call for  billion eurosto expand Intel’s existing site in Leixlip, Ireland, by doubling manufacturing space and expanding its new foundry services business, to build chips designed by other firms. That will bring the company’s total Irish investment to more than  billion euros Intel says it is also in talks with Italy “to enable a state-of-the-art back-end manufacturing facility” that would involve potential investment of up to . billion eurosand create thousands of direct and indirect jobs.There are also plans for a research and development hub and a foundry design centre in France, expanded lab space in Poland and to team up with local researchers for an advanced computing lab in Spain..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Intel unveils  xAbn chipmaking expansion plan for Europe article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMore than  new listings have been made under the UK’s sanctions regimes, targeting those well-connected with Russia’s leader.An update to the Gov.uk website on Tuesday said that  new listings had been made under the Russia sanctions regime.The Foreign Office later said Ms Truss was to announce more than  “Russian and Belarussian sanctions”, bringing the total number of iniduals, entities, and subsidiaries put under strict measures to over , since the invasion of Ukraine began.It is understood the new additions will bring the UK in line with restrictive measures already announced by the European Union and by other allies.The list of those sanctioned has been expanded to include a further  Russian oligarchs and their families, plus a raft of politicians and “propagandists”.These include Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and former President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev.Vladimir Putin’s Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova are also on the list, as is internet ‘troll farm’, the Internet Research Agency.Russian oligarchs now subject to UK sanctions include Mikhail Fridman, Pyotr Aven, and German Khan. The Foreign Office said the oligarchs sanctioned on Tuesday have a combined estimated worth of more than £ billion.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: “We are going further and faster than ever in hitting those closest to Putin – from major oligarchs, to his Prime Minister, and the propagandists who peddle his lies and disinformation. We are holding them to account for their complicity in Russia’s crimes in Ukraine.“Working closely with our allies, we will keep increasing the pressure on Putin and cut off funding for the Russian war machine.”.removeEarlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he welcomed Western sanctions but they “are not enough” to end the Russian aggression, calling for a full trade embargo.Boris Johnson, who was hosting a meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force nations in London which was addressed by Mr Zelensky via video-link, said: “I hear your point very loud and clear about the economic sanctions that we need to tighten, where we need to go harder on the banks, on Swt.”Further general economic sanctions were also announced on Tuesday, with the export of high-end luxury products to Russia being banned and import tarfs hiked on hundreds of goods, including vodka.But Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said: “This is shutting the door after the private jet has bolted. The Government has finally got their act together – but we should have been in this position weeks ago. This delay has given Putin’s cronies a priceless window to fire-sale their assets.👏 , offers of support!Thanks to the generosity of the British public weve received over K expressions of interest from iniduals and organisations so far in our Homes for Ukraine scheme.Register your interest here➡ https:t.co TleBCMwW#StandWithUkraine 🇬🇧🇺🇦 pic SAqEpqcdVN— Department for Levelling Up, Housing  CommunitiesMarch , “Now we need to go further. There are still too many associates of Putin getting away with it as we speak.“The fix to sanctions legislation is good news – but it means we can merely copy what our allies do. Liz Truss should bring proposals to Parliament to strengthen the legislation even further, so we can truly lead the way in clamping down on Kremlin-linked oligarchs.”It comes as the Home Office said , visas had been issued so far under the Ukraine Family Scheme, while nearly , British households had put themselves forward to take in Ukrainian refugees.The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities confirmed the number on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon.Earlier, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said he was “actually quite proud” the website allowing Britons to volunteer had crashed within the first few minutes of going live on Monday.He said he was “glad the website crashed, because it is a reflection of that generosity of the British people”.Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine –  March Find out more about the UK governments response: https:t.co aNaWPBRi🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic lrwwxDvxL— Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧March , No  said it would “encourage” those willing to provide accommodation to fleeing Ukrainians to offer longer than the minimum stipulation of six months. But Downing Street said most refugees would “want tohome as soon as possible”.The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The Ukrainian ambassador to London, the Ukrainian government has been clear that the vast majority of those forced to flee will want tohome as soon as possible, so at this stage it is hard to predict whatof time people may want to stay.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: UK targets Russian oligarchs, politicians and  upropagandists u in fresh sanctions article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityOn the diplomatic front, talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives have become “more constructive”, according to Kyiv, and the leaders of three European Union countries — including Poland, a Nato member on Ukraine’s doorstep — visited the embattled capital in a bold show of support.With the number of people driven from the country by the war eclipsing three million, large explosions thundered across Kyiv before dawn from what Ukrainian authorities said were artillery strikes, as Russia’s assault on the capital appeared to become more systematic and edged closer to the city centre. vw,vw,px, px\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said barrages hit four multi-storey buildings in the city and killed dozens of people. The shelling ignited a huge fire in a -storey apartment building and spurred a frantic rescue effort.The strikes on the th day of Russia’s invasion targeted a western district of Kyiv, disrupting a relative calm that had ed after an initial advance by Moscow’s forces was stopped in the early days of the war.A senior US defence source said the Russians were using long-range fire to hit civilian targets within Kyiv with increasing frequency but that their ground forces were making little to no progress around the country. The official said Russian forces were still about nine miles from the centre of Kyiv.Ukrainian presidential aide Ihor Zhovkva said Russia has stopped airing demands for Ukraine to surrender, and the Ukrainian representatives felt “moderately optimistic” after the latest talks. Discussions are expected to continue tomorrow.In a statement that seemed to signal potential grounds for agreement with Moscow, Mr Zelensky told European leaders gathered in London that he realises Nato has no intention of accepting Ukraine..remove vw,vw,px, px\"“We have heard for many years about the open doors, but we also heard that we can’t enter those doors,” he said. “This is the truth, and we have simply to accept it as it is.”Nato does not admit nations with unsettled territorial conflicts.The UN said close to  civilians in Ukraine have been confirmed killed, but the true figure is probably much higher.The leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia travelled to Kyiv by train despite the security risks, in a visit EU officials said was not sanctioned by other members of the -nation bloc.“The aim of the visit is to express the European Union’s unequivocal support for Ukraine and its freedom and independence,” Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said in a tweet.He was joined by fellow Janez Jansa of Slovenia and Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland, as well as Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Poland’s de facto leader. vw,vw,px, px\"Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in a tweet that the leaders had arrived, lauding “the courage of true friends”. He said they were discussing support for Ukraine and further sanctions against Russia.New efforts to take civilians to safety and deliver aid were under way around the country. The Red Cross said it was working to evacuate people from the north-eastern town of Sumy, near the Russian border, in about  buses.One of the most desperate situations is in Mariupol, the southern city of , where officials say a weeks-long siege has killed more than , people and left residents struggling for food, water, heat and medicine.Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a deputy head of Mr Zelensky’s office, said that  out of about , vehicles that left Mariupol have reached the city of Zaporizhzhia,  miles to the north west, while others will spend the night in towns along the way.Fighting has intensied on Kyiv’s outskirts in recent days, and air raid sirens wailed inside the capital. Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced a -hour curfew extending until Thursday morning.Tuesday’s artillery strikes hit the Svyatoshynskyi district of western Kyiv, adjacent to the suburb of Irpin, which has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.Flames shot out of the -storey apartment building and smoke choked the air as firefighters climbed ladders to rescue people. The assault blackened several floors of the building, ripped a hole in the ground outside and blew out windows in neighbouring apartment blocks. Rescue workers said at least one person was killed.A -storey apartment building in the Podilsky district of Kyiv, north of the government quarter, was damaged. Russian forces also stepped up strikes overnight on Irpin and the north-west Kyiv suburbs of Hostomel and Bucha, said the head of the capital region, Oleksiy Kuleba.“Many streets have been turned into a mush of steel and concrete. People have been hiding for weeks in basements, and are afraid to go out even for evacuations,” he said on Ukrainian television.In the east, Russian forces launched more than  strikes overnight on Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, according to regional administration chief Oleh Sinehubov. The strikes hit the city’s historical centre, including the main marketplace.Ukraine’s parliament voted to extend martial law for another month, until April .

Picture: PA Twickenham Stadium, London​Saturday, February .pmNew Wales flanker Jac Morgan admits playing at Twickenham next week would be special given the historic rugby rivalry between England and Wales.Morgan won his first cap on Saturday as reigning Six Nations champions Wales bounced back from a Dublin drubbing against Ireland to beat Scotland - in Cardf.The Welsh-speaking Ospreys openside says he was so nervous before kick-off that he almost forgot the words of the national anthem ‘Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau’.“It’s always a dream to play for your country from a young age,” said the -year-old.“Growing up England is one of the biggest games with the rivalry between the two countries over the years.“Everybody knows how big the game is with the history between the two sides.\"Morgan produced an impressive debut display last weekend, as Wales revived their Six Nations title hopes before heading to Twickenham next Saturday.Courtney Lawes has resumed full training in time to reinforce the middle phase of England’s Guinness Six Nations title push.Lawes was unable to play in the opening two rounds of the tournament because of concussion but has now completed histo play protocols and comes into contention to face Wales next Saturday..removeDefence coach, Anthony Seibold, said: \"Courtney trained fully today , which is obviously really good news for himself and England. He looked sharp.\"Meanwhile, Wasps flanker Jack Willis is set to make his first appearance in a year after finally recovering from the serious knee injury sustained against Italy at Twickenham in the  championship.England v Wales Six Nations: How to watch on TV, live streamThe England v Wales Six Nations match kicks off at .pm on Saturday, February .You can watch coverage on ITV or live stream the game via ITV Hub.Alternatively,you cant make it to a screen, you can also listen live on BBC Radio  Live Sports Extra. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
