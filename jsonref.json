The plans come after the Duke of Edinburgh collided with a car near Sandringham in January, injuring two womenLicences expire when drivers reach 70. It is up to them to confirm their sight is good enough if they ask for a new one.A DfT spokesman said: ‘We want to find out more about how eyesight testing could play a role in reducing fatalities.’But Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘We are not aware of evidence showing poor sight is a significant cause of accidents among older drivers.’Clinical governance manager at Optical Express, Amy Laux, explained the importance of eye checks for drivers - and not just those over the age of 70.\u0027The crystalline lens within the eye will change as we age, especially once we reach over 40, the lens starts to become less flexible and focusing on objects can be difficult,\u0027 she explained. \u0027We call this condition presbyopia.

Kim Jong-un bragged that the new weapon would bring \u0027inescapable distress\u0027 to \u0027fat targets\u0027 who could be hit by the weapon, including Seoul and a nearby US military base         Kim was accompanied for the launch by his top defence advisers and nuclear specialists including Ri Pyong-chol (far right), Kim Jong-sik (second left) and Jang Chang-ha (left)         Kim Jong-un is attempting to pressure the US and South Korea into abandoning joint military drills, and return to the negotiating table         The North\u0027s state media release an image of the missile\u0027s launch platform, but had heavily pixellated it in an unusual move for the Hermit KingdomHe told Fox Business: \u0027But you have to ask when the real diplomacy is going to begin, when the working-level discussions on denuclearization will begin, as Kim Jong Un again said on June 30 he was prepared to do. \u0027We\u0027re still waiting to hear from North Korea.\u0027Kim Dong-yub, an analyst from Seoul\u0027s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the North might have tested an improved version of its 300-millimeter multiple rocket launcher system or an entirely new system, such as 400-millimeter rockets.When asked whether it failed to distinguish between multiple-rocket launchers and ballistic missiles, the JCS said South Korean and U.S. militaries shared an assessment that the flight characteristics from Wednesday\u0027s launches were similar to North Korea\u0027s new short-range missiles tested last week. JCS official Kim Joon-rak said further analysis was needed to identify the weapons.South Korea\u0027s military had said the flight data of the missile launched last week showed similarities to the Russian-made Iskander, a solid-fuel, nuclear-capable missile that is highly maneuverable and travels on lower trajectories compared to conventional ballistic weapons.Choi Hyun-soo, spokeswoman of Seoul\u0027s Defense Ministry, refused to answer when asked whether it\u0027s possible that the North might have mixed in a ballistic missile launch while testing its new rocket system.In a closed-door briefing to lawmakers, officials from South Korea\u0027s National Intelligence Service said North Korea might extend its weapons tests into August.        Wednesday\u0027s test came less than a week after the Hermit Kingdom fired a short-range ballistic missile (pictured) which flew 370 miles into the Sea of Japan          One of Thursday\u0027s missiles flew around 430 miles out into the Sea of Japan before splashing down into the ocean. Pictured: Kim Kong-Un inspecting a newly built submarineThe spy agency believes the North would want to demonstrate its displeasure over the planned U.S.-South Korea military exercises and the South\u0027s acquisition of advanced weapons such as F-35 fighter jets while also speeding up its own weapons development before it gets deeper in nuclear negotiations with the United States, lawmaker Lee Eun-jae said.U.S. officials have downplayed the threat of the launches to the United States and its allies.Analysts say North Korea, with its consecutive weapons tests, is demonstrating displeasure with the pace of nuclear diplomacy with Washington. The North\u0027s testing activity could intensify if the negotiations do not proceed rapidly over the next few months, said Srinivasan Sitaraman, a North Korea expert at Clark University in Massachusetts.By firing weapons that directly threaten South Korea but not the U.S. mainland or its Pacific territories, North Korea also appears to be dialing up pressure on Seoul and testing how far Washington will tolerate its bellicosity without actually causing the nuclear negotiations to collapse, other experts say.Last Thursday, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles that Seoul officials said flew 600 kilometers (370 miles) and as high as 50 kilometers (30 miles) before landing in the sea. North Korea said those tests also were supervised by Kim and were designed to deliver a \u0027solemn warning\u0027 to South Korea over its purchase of high-tech, U.S.-made fighter jets and the planned military drills, which Pyongyang calls an invasion rehearsal. The North also tested short-range missiles on May 4 and 9.Earlier last week, Kim visited a newly built submarine and expressed his satisfaction with its weapons system. North Korea said its deployment was \u0027near at hand.\u0027In a private briefing to lawmakers Wednesday, South Korean military intelligence officers said they\u0027ve determined that the submarine likely has three launch tubes for missiles. If confirmed, it would be North Korea\u0027s first operational submarine with missile launch tubes, some experts said."},{"url":null,"title":"Vietnamese excavator driver shows ingenious method loading vehicle truck","story":"Share this article        But the driver then swivels the arm around and pushes downwards into the ground, lifting the digger into the air.

As a young photographer, I was so nervous. All of these senior German officials were swanning around my studio inspecting my work.I blurted out that I wasn’t American, that I was born in Canada, almost like a confession. I felt I had to tell them. They just looked at me quizzically, laughed and started speaking in German. I have no idea what they thought of me. But I got the job.In the west, I discovered a different side to the disorder. Every Saturday, punks would hang out, drink beer and blare music through their soundsystems. Cars would be set alight and bank windows smashed in. The cops would arrive, teargas them and send them running to find shelter in nearby bars, and the whole cycle would repeat. They were sceptical of me to begin with. One guy even headbutted me. In retrospect, I think that was a sign of acceptance.Getting to know them wasn’t easy, and it happened in the strangest of ways. I would carry a bunch of bananas to snack on while I wandered the streets. When I found the punks, I didn’t know what to say, so I offered them bananas. They just laughed at me. But they must have liked it, because they welcomed me into their crew.As I got to know them, I realised they fitted into the idea of the “wall sickness”, but they were the manic side of the depression that reigned in the east. There was something psychotic about punk at the time. These weren’t just weekend punks and “punk” wasn’t just a look – this was their life.The woman in this shot was called Miriam, and the rat on her shoulder is called Bestia. It was a week or so before Reagan was planning to visit, and there were windows smashed all over the city in protest. Despite the violence and the militancy, she was extremely gentle. She was big, much bigger than me, but she had a soft way of gesturing and moving.She invited me to her place, a nearby squat. We hung out, drank tea, took some shots and became friends. She introduced me to her rat, Bestia, who lived in her oven. Being a squat, it had no electricity, so it was perfectly safe. Bestia was almost like a  angel for Miriam, keeping her safe amid the anarchy. I think it was useful to keep guys off her back, too – nobody’s messing when you have a rat draped around your neck.People feel this image represents a moment in Berlin’s history, or the punk movement more broadly, but to me it’s a shot of someone I got to know, who welcomed me into a hard-to-reach scene. It was a doorway for me into other activist and protest scenes, and I remember the time fondly.People seem to think that punk has died, and maybe elements of the aesthetic have. But the spirit of punk was so much more than a look, and I think that lives on, albeit in different forms. I think we saw it in the Occupy movement, within elements of the Arab spring, and I think we are seeing it today in the UK with Extinction Rebellion.Training: Film and television production, New York University.Influences: Diane Arbus, Brassaï, the Capa brothers, Eikoh Hosoe, André Kertész, Dorothea Lange, Helen Levitt, Mary Ellen Mark, László Moholy-Nagy, Gordon Parks, Thomas Ruff, Aaron Siskind, Francesca Woodman.Low point: “A life-changing accident on a film set in 1979.”Top tip: “Draw with your eyes.

Can we learn to love it again, asks Dana CzapnikHere’s a thought. Teen angst, once regarded as stubbornly generic, is actually a product of each person’s unique circumstances: gender, race, class, era. Angst is universal, but the content of it is particular.This might explain why Holden Caulfield, once the universal everyteen, does not speak to this generation in the way he’s spoken to young people in the past. Electric Literature gave this explanation of The Catcher in the Rye’s datedness: “If you’re a white, relatively affluent, permanently grouchy young man with no real problems at all, it’s extraordinarily relatable. The problem comes when you’re not. Where’s The Catcher in the Rye for the majority of readers who are too non-young, non-white, and non-male to be able to stand listening to Holden Caulfield feel sorry for himself?”On the one hand, Yes! On the other, Oof!I’ve had conversations about Catcher with undergraduate students in creative writing classes I’ve taught, and every one has complained about disliking Holden. In my limited network of young people, Catcher is not only no longer beloved, it has become something even more tragic: uncool.But is it as simple as Electric Literature posits – that if you’re not white, privileged and male, it’s hard to see yourself in Holden? After all, this is partly why I wrote my coming-of-age novel The Falconer, told from the perspective of a young woman in early 1990s New York. Maybe hating on Holden has turned into its own form of adolescent rebellion. Catcher was an incendiary novel when it was first published and was banned from many school districts. Reading it once felt subversive now it’s a reliable presence on most curriculums. And once adults tell you something’s good, aren’t you supposed to hate it?But it’s not just girls and kids of colour who are turned off by Holden I have found that my white, male students didn’t like him either. I spoke with several New York City public school English teachers, who all confirmed my suspicion that it’s not just Holden’s identity that keeps him from resonating with younger readers – though that’s part of it.Instead, broad shifts within culture have rendered Holden’s malaise annoying instead of resonant. For one thing, the concept of Holden’s total isolation from the adult world – the molten core of the novel – is anathema to kids who have come of age in a culture where they are precious and valued.In Salinger’s era, a struggling, depressed teen had to pick himself up by the bootstraps and be a man. The idea that he could wander through New York for a couple of days, unaccounted for, without any contact from an adult in his life must seem completely foreign to kids today, who are kept on tight leashes. A parent can watch their child’s exact geolocation from a handheld device. Holden had much more freedom, but it came with a heaping side order of neglect.Though young people today are more carefully watched, they’re also looking out at the adult world and seeing very clearly that it has gone absolutely mad. How can one get all worked up about some “phony” classmate or a brother who sold out to Hollywood (is selling out even a thing any more?) when earlier that morning you did an active shooter drill in homeroom? Or when it’s possible the Earth might be uninhabitable within your lifetime and the grownups are doing nothing about it? Holden’s melancholia feels positively quaint in comparison to the problems kids face today.I’ve read Catcher at a few different stages of my life, and it’s changed each time. First at the age of 13, as part of my education as a New York City kid attending a progressive private school on the Upper West Side (just a Central Park away from Holden’s stomping grounds), then again on my own at 17, when I was mainlining ennui and noticing how disappointing people were. So I fell in love.When I was about to graduate college at 21 and feeling that morphine drip of nostalgia that accompanies points of departure in youth, I read Catcher again in search of my old friend. But by then, Holden’s appeal had worn off. I’d figured out sensitive and angry young men usually reserved their sensitivity for themselves. It was like bumping into an old crush and realising that everything you ever liked about them was a projection. After I turned the last page I thought, “What did I ever see in that guy?” As with most things in life, reading Catcher is all about timing.I’m closer now to 40 than to 17. I no longer read to find friends in literature – I read for the writing. So when I recently read the book for the fourth time, I saw something brand new and I think closer to what Salinger intended: a perfectly written portrait of an imperfect character. Every syllable sings. Much of what I saw in this fourth reading, I had completely missed before.Which puts Catcher in a bit of a Catch-22. Kids who are reading to fall in love with a book no longer relate to Holden, and adult readers who appreciate the craftsmanship are too old to be struck by it emotionally.So, here’s my proposal to readers coming to The Catcher in the Rye for the first time now: read it as early as possible in your life. Read it alongside Ralph Ellison, Sylvia Plath, James Baldwin, Junot Díaz, Toni Morrison, André Aciman and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Hate it if you must. Rail against Holden. Call him a spoiled brat. When it comes to all the money and opportunity he squanders, he is! Let 20 years pass. Let the world wash over you, then read it again. You might see Holden for who he really is. Not a stand-in for every single teenager that ever walked the Earth, but a lonely inidual who finds the injustices of the world intolerable.• The Falconer by Dana Czapnik is out now (Faber \u0026amp Faber)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/668e778b21754e516600f74a9b95628371ee898c/0_213_3925_2355/master/3925.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c276a4d5e57f775c00f24f46f3e580e","title":"burger king impossible whopper nationwide plant based","story":"Burger King will begin selling the plant-based Impossible Whopper across the US next week after a successful run in six regions.The rollout to 7,000 locations will be for a limited time, a typical practice in the fast-food industry for new products.

What if Lord Halifax rather than Churchill had become prime minister in May 1940? To the “what if” history book could soon be added a new chapter: “what if” the UK had exited the EU with a deal in October 2019?That, despite everything that has been happening at Westminster in the past week, remains the assumption of the Bank of England. In its last inflation report before the Brexit deadline, the Bank said its base case was a smooth transition to a UK-EU trade deal. Its projections do not include the possibility of a no-deal exit.Johnson\u0026nbsptold the Treasury select committee\u0026nbspin March 2016:\u0026nbsp“Our relationship with the EU is already very well developed. It doesn’t seem to me to be very hard … to do a free trade deal very rapidly indeed.”Speaking at a Vote Leave event\u0026nbspin March 2016, Johnson said:\u0026nbsp“I put it to you, all those who say that there would be barriers to trade with Europe if we were to do a Brexit, do you seriously believe that they would put up tariffs against UK produce of any kind, when they know how much they want to sell us their cake, their champagne, their cheese from France? It is totally and utterly absurd.”Johnson, then foreign secretary,\u0026nbsptold the House of Commons in July 2017:“There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.”Two months before the June 2016 referendum vote,\u0026nbspRaab told Andrew Neil on BBC Sunday Politics:\u0026nbsp“We’re very well placed, and mutual self-interest suggests we’d cut a very good deal and it’s certainly not in the European’s interests to erect trade barriers.”During an appearance\u0026nbspon the BBC’s Daily Politics in April 2016, Raab added: “The idea that Britain would be apocalyptically off the cliff edge if we left the EU is silly.”In\u0026nbspApril 2016, Michael Gove said the UK would have the best of both worlds. “Outside the EU, we would still benefit from the free trade zone which stretches from Iceland to the Russian border,” he said. “But we wouldn’t have all the EU regulations which cost our economy £600m every week.”After the referendum, in July 2017, the then-international trade secretary\u0026nbspLiam Fox said: “The free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history. We are already beginning with zero tariffs, and we are already beginning at the point of maximal regulatory equivalence, as it is called. In other words, our rules and our laws are exactly the same.”This complicates matters for the Bank because it uses the current exchange rate and the expected path of interest rates to produce its forecasts even though its Brexit assumptions are more benign. That, as the Bank freely admits, leads to “inconsistencies” in the forecast.And the report was modestly tougher than the City might have been anticipating. The City fully expects the Bank to cut rates in the event of a no-deal Brexit: the Bank is maintaining its line that borrowing costs could go either way.What’s more, even if a deal led to a rise in the value of the pound and higher interest rates than currently expected, the monetary policy committee thinks that further action would be needed to prevent the economy from overheating.By the time of the next inflation report in November a lot will have become clearer. For now, the Bank’s forecasts are even more of a stab in the dark than usual."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5fe05fd5157864e4fd85003e468ec5c388fb9c4/0_152_4494_2695/master/4494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=572d6a1cd2c435c0c20dc6be6b242ecc","title":"london stock exchange agrees 22bn deal to buy refinitiv","story":"Deal will increase LSEG’s presence in US and allow expansion into AsiaThe London Stock Exchange Group has agreed a $27bn (£22bn) deal to buy Refinitiv in a move that will transform it into a UK-headquartered, global rival to Michael Bloomberg’s financial news and data business.The all-share deal will allow LSE to take control of Refinitiv, whose Eikon terminals on trading floors challenge those provided by Bloomberg, from a consortium led by Blackstone and including Thomson Reuters, which owns the Reuters news service.“The acquisition of Refinitiv is transformational,” said David Schwimmer, the chief executive of LSEG. “It is a rare and compelling opportunity to combine two world class businesses and create a global financial infrastructure leader. We will continue to be a global business headquartered in the UK.”Schwimmer said the deal would increase its presence in the US, the world’s biggest financial market, and also allow it to expand in Asia and emerging markets.He said that increasing LSEG’s international exposure is not a response to Brexit and that the company is prepared for a no-deal scenario.“LSEG has been prepared for whatever may come through Brexit,” he said. “We are already ersified across regions and by currencies. This transaction helps us become more global. This is not about Brexit.”The finance chief, David Warren, said there would be job cuts, as part of £350m of cost savings over the next five years, but would not say how many redundancies there would be.Blackstone moved to take a majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ financial and risk business just last year, subsequently renaming it Refinitiv, for $20bn.LSEG’s move is the latest in a City spree that has recorded £35bn in deals in the last week.Earlier this week, Just Eat, the food delivery app, and Dutch rival Takeaway announced plans for a £9bn merger that would create one of the world’s biggest online food delivery companies.Last week, Cobham, the UK aerospace and defence supplier founded by a British aviation pioneer, agreed to be bought by US private equity firm Advent International in a £4bn deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b02bf9d8c0b8157006a6d28926913edf197f5ba2/0_399_3677_2206/master/3677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f16f0650476815fb6dad15212d711dc","title":"markets await bank of england interest rate decision and economic forecasts business live","story":"Here is our economics editor Larry Elliott’s take on the Bank of England’s projections. The main reason is the strengthening of the dollar after the Fed made clear that yesterday’s rate reduction was not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts, while the pound is also under pressure from growing nervousness around a no-deal Brexit. That was the last question at the Bank of England’s press conference.Question: You are just a bunch of gloomsters, talking the economy down?Carney appears unfazed. (It’s not the first time he has faced this question.) He replies:We give our best view of where we expect the economy to go.He then notes that uncertainty has increased due to Brexit.It’s also clear that there has been a substantial shortfall in investment. He adds that the Bank sets policy in a way that supports the economy, and took appropriate action after the 2016 referendum.Carney says that markets functioned well after the shock 2016 Brexit vote – “heavy volumes, big moves in sterling but the markets functioned well”. He says it is “highly, highly unlikely” that the Bank will need to take action to stabilise markets if there is a no-deal Brexit.What one wants when you have a big economic shock and we’ve learned this, and we are a firm believer in it, is that markets adjust.Carney says the Bank will publish an updated version of its worst-case Brexit scenario after the Treasury select committee reconvenes in September, after receiving a request from the parliamentary committee.Here are some of the Bank of England governor’s earlier comments on no-deal Brexit in full.In the event of no-deal, no-transition Brexit, sterling would likely fall, the risk premiums on UK assets would rise and volatility would spike higher.Question: what would a no-deal Brexit mean for the global economy?Carny replies that it would be “an unwelcome development for the global economy” and that multilateralism is already under some strain. This would be part of that narrative and it’s creeping into the way businesses organise themselves, in particular how they organise their supply chains.You can watch the press conference live here.Asked if there would be a massive stimulus after a no deal, Carney responds that it depends on the situation, and that the Bank “will do what we can” but “there are limits” – as the Bank would still need to achieve its inflation target. He says there could be trade disruption – problems at ports – and supply disruption.We will have to take a judgement in that event whether on balance the inflationary pressures ... whether we can look through those and provide support to the economy as it adjusts.We will do what we can in those circumstances to support jobs and activity but there are limits.UK households at the moment are acting prudently, spending within their means, Carney says. He notes that there is a strong labour market and wages are growing at the fastest pace since before the financial crisis in 2008.Here is a chart illustrating the central growth forecast from the Bank of England’s inflation report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3cb43032f8eee5b54fb0b24b4193dfa7cc3b09/0_195_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c78332aa38d7fd90f272e41738b2c9c3","title":"roaming cafes and pirate boats readers favourite floating traders","story":"We asked you to recommend canal boat shops, and you did not disappointFrom home brew kits to pirate-themed gifts, when we asked for your favourite canal boat shops, you certainly gave us variety.

In May, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, attacked subsidies, saying: “What we are doing is using taxpayers’ money – which means our money – to boost hurricanes, to spread droughts, to melt glaciers, to bleach corals. In one word: to destroy the world.”The new analysis shows how redirecting some of the fossil fuel subsidies could decisively tip the balance in favour of green energy, making it the cheapest electricity available and instigating a rapid global rollout.The transition from polluting fossil fuels to clean energy is already under way. Annual investment in renewables has been greater than that in fossil fuel electricity generation since 2008 and new renewable capacity has exceeded fossil fuel power each year since 2014.But progress is slow compared with the urgency required, said Bridle. “There is no question that renewables can power the energy system,” he said. “The question now is can we transition quickly enough away from fuels like coal, and subsidy reform is a very obvious step towards that.” Very few ways of cutting emissions actually save governments money, he said.“Taking away subsidies from fossil fuels and channelling them towards clean energy would boost their development at a much faster pace, and help secure our climate goals,” said Ipek Gençsü of the Overseas Development Institute. An added bonus is the social and economic benefits, such as reduced air pollution and health spending, she said.Most experts define fossil fuel subsidies as financial or tax support for those buying fuel or the companies producing it. The IMF also includes the cost of the damage fossil fuel burning causes to climate and health, leading to an estimate of $5.2tn of fossil fuel subsidies in 2017, or $10m a minute. Ending the subsidies would cut global emissions by about a quarter, the IMF estimates, and halve the number of early deaths from fossil fuel air pollution.Bridle said funding fossil fuel subsidies was “madness”, but said ending them could cause short-term price rises and political difficulties, as the benefits of lower costs in the future and reduced air pollution are less obvious.“There are political problems but it is worth persevering because the prize is so big,” he said. “You have to bring people along with you.” Gençsü said governments must ensure that the most vulnerable people were not adversely affected by changes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/828397ab2923c6df6e002d70a55e9ddc490e6e1f/0_165_5468_3281/master/5468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9aa9669758b55cdaba80cc1d881bc645","title":"use your waste water to save street trees experts urge","story":"Dishwater and bathwater can be used to give vital support that councils often cannot afford to young treesInstead of letting your dirty dishwater go down the drain, consider using it to water the trees on your street. That is the message from tree experts, who say survival rates for urban trees could be boosted significantly by volunteers.Russell Miller, a London-based arboricultural consultant, said: “If you plant trees from good stock, at the right time, and provide enough water, you’d lose almost none prematurely. But get that wrong, and more than half can die.”Miller says a big issue is that local council budgets often do not stretch to include proper watering, which is critical in the first three years of a tree’s life. “Watering is less sexy than planting. It’s cheaper to replace them,” he said.New street trees need at least 20 litres of water a week – about two large watering cans – from April to September, especially in hot weather, says Miller. Any tap or grey water, including dishwater, bathwater and water from washing cars, windows and even clothes, is fine, as long as it does not contain bleach.“The idea is not just to plant a million trees, but to establish a million trees,” warned Tony Kirkham, arboretum head at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew.Most species of street tree, such as the London plane, are chosen especially for their resilience and tolerance of urban stress. But even these species need years to develop root systems that can find their own sources of moisture among the networks of cables and pipes, and compacted soil under pavements and roads.“Once street trees get stressed it’s difficult for them to bounce back, they really struggle, and have to rely on rain falling the following year,” Kirkham explained. “If this doesn’t happen, the problem is compounded from year to year.”Citizen-led projects are making an impact, and some local councils, including Cambridge, Sheffield, Camden, Kingston-upon-Thames, Waltham, Enfield and Richmond, have started social media campaigns, put signs up on trees and sent out leaflets urging residents to water their local trees.“Councils are hoping for rain, and hoping they’ll survive, but there are heavy losses when it comes to urban tree planting. The public can dramatically improve their chances of survival,” said Kirkham. “Anything we can do to relieve the stress on our trees is a massive bonus, for both our local authorities and our trees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d2eab46932a30cb8391b76c60dc040ae10e1052/0_157_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a6f7e10b602737f4434577915b235d7","title":"what should we do with radioactive nuclear waste","story":"The race is on to develop strategies for storing the most dangerous materials on EarthThere’s a small red hammer and sickle flag of the old Soviet Union on my dresser at home. I found it years ago on the floor of a primary school in Pripyat, the town built for workers at the doomed Chernobyl nuclear plant in what is now Ukraine.Perhaps it had been waved by a child at a state occasion, or had been left behind in the rush to evacuate Pripyat after the world’s worst nuclear disaster in April 1986.Less than two miles away, the stricken, crumbling Reactor 4 was one of the most dangerous places on Earth. Everything for miles around, from the mushrooms in the woods to the trucks left in the parking lots to the toys in the nursery and the hospital beds, was radioactive to some degree.Even though a dosimeter showed that after being washed down, the little flag was barely more radioactive than normal background levels found in nature, it should have been packaged up and landfilled as low-level nuclear waste.By contrast, Chernobyl’s Reactor 4 site will remain dangerous for tens of thousands of years. In July 2019, 33 years after the explosion, 200 metric tonnes of uranium, plutonium, liquid fuel and irradiated dust was finally encased below an enormous €1.5bn (£1.35bn) steel and concrete structure taller than the Statue of Liberty. The new sarcophagus will last about 100 years – after which it will deteriorate and future generations will have to decide how to dismantle and store it permanently.Skip forward to Cameron, Texas, on 16 January 2019. This was a nerve-racking day for Liz Muller, cofounder of California startup technology company Deep Isolation and her father, Richard Muller, professor emeritus of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, and now chief technology officer at Deep Isolation.The father-daughter team had invited 40 nuclear scientists, US Department of Energy officials, oil and gas professionals, and environmentalists to witness the first attempt to test whether the latest oil-fracking technology could be used to permanently dispose of the most dangerous nuclear waste.At 11.30am, the crew of oil workers used a wire cable to lower an 80cm-long, 20cm-wide, 64kg canister — filled with steel rather than radioactive waste — down a previously drilled borehole. Then, using a tool called a “tractor” invented by the industry to reach horizontally into mile-deep oil reservoirs, they pushed it 120 metres farther away from the borehole through the rock.Five hours later, the crew used the tractor to relocate and collect the canister, attach it to the cable and pull it back to the surface – to the cheers of the workers. Until then, few people in the nuclear industry had believed this could be done.By avoiding the need to excavate large, expensive tunnels to store waste below ground, the Deep Isolation team believes it has found a solution to one of the world’s most intractable environmental problems – how to permanently dispose of and potentially retrieve the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of nuclear waste currently being stored at nuclear power plants and research and military stations around the world.“We showed it could be done,” Elizabeth Muller says. “Horizontal, directional drilling has come a long way recently. This is now an off-the-shelf technology. Using larger canisters, we think about 300 boreholes with tunnels up to two miles long would be able to take much of the US’s high-level nuclear waste. We think we can reduce by two-thirds the cost of permanent storage.”“We are using a technique that’s been made cheap over the last 20 years,” says Richard Muller, who has worked in the shale gas industry. “We realised we could put together the oil and nuclear technologies. One offered the solution to the other. These capsules can be lowered deep down, far deeper than anyone has proposed, and stored underneath a billion tonnes of rock so none of the radiation gets out.”The dilemma of how to manage nuclear waste – radioactive materials routinely produced in large quantities at every stage of nuclear power production, from uranium mining and enrichment to reactor operation and the reprocessing of spent fuel – has taxed the industry, academics and governments for decades.Along with accidents, it has been a major reason for continuing public opposition to the industry’s further expansion despite substantial interest in nuclear’s status as a low-carbon power source that can help mitigate climate change.In 80-odd years of nuclear power, in which more than 450 commercial reactors, many experimental stations and tens of thousands of nuclear warheads have been built, great stockpiles of different levels of waste have accumulated.The rest is made up of vast quantities of what is called low-level and very low-level waste. This comprises scrap metal, paper, plastics, building materials and everything else radioactive involved in the operation and dismantling of nuclear facilities.The consensus is that about 22,000 cubic metres of solid high-level waste has accumulated in temporary storage but not been disposed of (moved to permanent storage) in 14 western countries, along with unknown amounts in China, Russia and at military stations.A further 460,000 cubic metres of intermediate waste is being stored, and about 3.5m cubic metres of low-level waste. About 34,000 cubic metres of new high-level and intermediate waste is generated each year by operating civil reactors, says the WNA.The US, with 59 nuclear power plants comprising 97 working civil reactors, each generating at least several tonnes of high-level waste per year, has about 90,000 tonnes of high-level waste awaiting permanent disposal, according to the US Government Accountability Office.Although it is impossible to come up with a global total because of differences in how quantities are measured and reported, and with some inventories kept secret, other countries harbour significant amounts of waste as well.In the early days of nuclear power, waste of any sort was barely considered. British, American and Russian authorities, among others, dumped nuclear waste – including more than 150,000 tonnes of low-level waste – at sea or in rivers. Since then, billions have been spent trying to identify how best to reduce the amount produced and then store it for what may be eternity.Many ideas have been investigated, but most have been rejected as impractical, too expensive or ecologically unacceptable. They include: shooting it into space isolating it in synthetic rock burying it in ice sheets dumping it on the world’s most isolated islands and dropping it to the bottom of the world’s deepest oceanic trenches.Vertical boreholes up to 5,000 metres deep have also been proposed, and this option is said by some scientists to be promising. But there have been doubts, because it is likely to be nearly impossible to retrieve waste from vertical boreholes.Two scientific developments excite nuclear scientists. One is to build a new generation of advanced fast neutron reactors, which would use the high-level waste as fuel. This slowly emerging “Generation IV” nuclear power programme is billed by the industry as safer and more efficient. But even though such reactors can reduce the degree of hazard the waste poses, they do not solve the issue entirely.“These new reactors will still need a waste repository, likely as large as a repository for the waste produced by the current crop of conventional reactors,” says Allison MacFarlane, director of the Institute for International Science and Technical Policy at the George Washington University and chair of the US nuclear regulatory commission in 2012–14.The other technology that could reduce waste, known as transmutation, aims to reduce radiotoxicity by using lasers to change the composition of dangerous waste. It has been investigated for decades in the UK, US, Sweden and elsewhere but without great success.But the idea was boosted in December 2018 by French Nobel prize–winning physicist Gérard Mourou, who, in his acceptance lecture, said laser beams millions of times brighter than the surface of the sun in bursts that last a millionth of a billionth of a second had the potential to neutralise nuclear waste, reducing its half-life to a few years and its radioactivity to very little.“Nuclear energy may be the best candidate for the future, but we are still left with a lot of dangerous junk. The idea is to transmute this nuclear waste into new forms of atoms which don’t have the problem of radioactivity. What you have to do is to change the makeup of the nucleus,” he said in the lecture.But Mourou accepted that it might take decades before this “extreme light” solution could be deployed to destroy nuclear waste on an industrial scale.After decades of civil nuclear power and billions spent researching different geological sites and ways to best dispose of the waste, the problems are both technical and political, and the consensus of governments and industry is that deep burial is the best solution – at least for the moment.Yet, so far, no country has managed to build a deep repository for high-level waste.“Although almost every nuclear country has, in principle, plans for the eventual burial of the most radioactive waste, only a handful have made any progress and nowhere in the world is there operating an authorised site for the deep geological disposal of the highest level radioactive waste,” says Andrew Blowers, author of The Legacy of Nuclear Power and a former member of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, set up to advise the British government on how and where to store nuclear waste.“Currently no options have been able to demonstrate that waste will remain isolated from the environment over the tens to hundreds of thousands of years. There is no reliable method to warn future generations about the existence of nuclear waste dumps,” he says.“The nuclear legacy stretches into the far future it poses a risk to environments and human health for periods which extend well beyond our comprehension. Radioactive waste is the achilles heel of the industry,” says Blowers.The US has come closest with a single deep repository. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico is a 655-metre deep complex for the disposal of “transuranic” waste, or long-lived intermediate level waste, mostly deriving from military bomb-making.By law, however, all high-level US nuclear waste must go to Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which since 1987 has been the designated deep geological repository about 90 miles north-west of Las Vegas.But the site has been met with continued legal, regulatory and constitutional challenges, becoming a political yo-yo since it was identified as a potentially suitable repository. It is fiercely opposed by the Western Shoshone peoples, Nevada state and others.A massive tunnel was excavated in Yucca Mountain but was never licensed and the site is now largely abandoned – to the frustration of the federal government and the nuclear industry, which has raised more than $41bn (£34bn) from a levy on consumer bills to pay for the repository and which must pay for heavy security at their temporary nuclear waste storage sites.“We need a high-level repository. We are holding waste now at about 121 sites across the US,” says Baker Elmore, director of federal programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute.He is supported by the US energy secretary, Rick Perry. “We have a moral and national security obligation to come up with a long-term solution, finding the safest repositories available … we can no longer kick the can down the road,” he said at a Senate hearing in June 2017.Political and community opposition to plans has made progress painfully slow in most countries. In the UK, the government has offered communities money, but has been unable to persuade any local authority to host a permanent deep repository. Massive protests in France and Germany helped fuel the political rise of the Green party and have indefinitely delayed or stopped work on proposed repositories.Only Finland is close to completing a deep repository for high-level waste. In May, work started on an “encapsulation” plant where waste will be packed inside copper canisters that will be transferred into 400- to 450-metre deep underground tunnels. But doubt has been cast on the long-term safety of the canisters.“The problem is intractable,” says Paul Dorfman, founder of the Nuclear Consulting Group, made up of about 120 international academics and independent experts in the fields of radiation waste, nuclear policy and environmental risk.“The bitter reality is that there is no scientifically proven way of disposing of the existential problem of high- and intermediate-level waste. Some countries have built repositories, some plan them.“But given the huge technical uncertainties, if disposal does go ahead and anything goes wrong underground in the next millennia, then future generations risk profound widespread pollution.”Many people now doubt that a satisfactory final repository will ever be found.“Managing the nuclear legacy is not just a technical issue but a social one,” says Blowers.“Given the timescales involved, there is no need to hurry. Society can and should take its time dealing with its nuclear legacy.”• This article originally appeared on Ensia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/011cdcafce21a4bba2c459b6e1d1ddf0d6f82dc0/76_377_2429_1458/master/2429.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=096575d9450184573841377937d12f23","title":"slow fashion how to keep your favourite clothes for ever from laundering to moth proofing","story":"Extending the life of your wardrobe is good for the planet and your finances. Experts give their tips on how to make your outfits last as long as possibleUnless you plan to wear a suit of armour for the rest of your life, there is no way to make your clothes last for ever. You can get close to for ever – if you are prepared to darn. As a society, though, we have become less inclined to make do and mend because the advent of fast fashion has made clothes so affordable that there is no incentive to repair them. In addition, the acceleration of trends – where once there were just two seasons, autumnwinter and springsummer, now there are also resort, cruise and pre-fall collections – means consumers are continually enticed to buy new things. It is estimated that, in the UK, the average lifetime for an item of clothing is 2.2 years.Extending the life of our clothes isn’t just good for our finances, but also benefits the environment: the fashion industry is a major global polluter and human rights abuses are rife in the garment industries of developing nations.Not so long ago, people learned basic sewing skills. The chances are that, if you ask an older friend or relative, they will be able to show you how to patch things. And there is no doubt that, if you want your clothes to last as long as possible, looking after them is the best place to start. But how do you make your clothes last for ever? We asked some experts.It sounds obvious, but if you want your clothes to last, you need to invest in well-made garments in good-quality fabric. Don’t assume that expensive items are best – check for yourself.“The first thing to do when you’re looking at a piece of clothing is turn it inside out and pull at every piece of string you find,” says Orsola de Castro of Fashion Revolution. “When clothes are cheaply made, the seams are often shabby. If it starts to unravel – don’t buy it.”She suggests making sure the seam allowance on a pair of trousers or a skirt is enough to allow you to let them out and the hem is such that you could make the garment longer if you need to. She also advises checking that shirts have a spare button sewn in so if one falls off, you have a replacement.Vintage clothing expert Amy Winston-Hart of Amy’s Vintage says you should hold garments up to the light: “If you can see light coming through the fabric, it’s going to go quickly.”Every garment will eventually wear out after repeated wearing and washing, but the jury is out on which fabrics are the most durable. Some experts prefer the longevity of synthetic fibres such as polyester, while others favour natural fibres such as cotton.Charles Ross, sustainability expert and lecturer at the Royal College of Art says: “I prefer wearing synthetics because I believe they are more durable fibres. If you have two identical T-shirts in cotton or polyester, the cotton will wear out quicker.” The more you wash clothes, the quicker they wear out. De Castro echoes Stella McCartney’s recent advice that we should refrain from over-cleaning clothes. “If something is made from good-quality wool, such as a man’s suit, it’s designed to be brushed clean and not washed,” she says. If you must wash things in a machine, use a low heat, and put delicate fabrics in a laundry bag to reduce tearing.There are plenty of ways to refresh clothes without bunging them in the machine: De Castro suggests spot-cleaning tricky stains, or taking whiffy garments into the bathroom while you shower, to steam them. This will not only help to make your clothes last longer, but is also more environmentally friendly. The average washing machine uses 13,500 gallons of water a year, as much as you drink in your lifetime.Winston-Hart has some nifty tricks for cleaning items without putting them in the machine. “A mixture of lukewarm water and vodka will get rid of smells,” she says. Use three parts vodka and two parts water if something is very stinky, or three parts water and two parts vodka if it only has a light musk. “Stick the mixture in a spray bottle and mist it over. If your clothing still smells bad the next day, give it another spray.” She is also a fan of popping clothes in the freezer, for an overnight refresh. If things are still pongy, hang them out on the line on a breezy day – you will be surprised by how much it can help.None of the experts I speak to are fans of dry cleaning, although they accept it is sometimes necessary. “Dry cleaning doesn’t always clean stuff that well,” says Winston-Hart. “Sometimes it comes back smelling worse – that chemical smell.” By looking after your clothes as much as possible, you can cut back on dry cleaning.An important caveat: items worn close to your skin, particularly underwear and socks, should be washed at an adequate heat. Don’t fling pants in with your dish towels on a 30C wash. “You really don’t want to put bedding, tea towels, gym kit, underwear and socks in at a low temperature,” says environmental health practitioner Dr Lisa Ackerley. All need to be washed at a minimum of 60C.If you are worried about ruining your underwear, wash it at a lower temperature, but add an antibacterial cleanser to the wash.Katrina Hassan, a professional organiser, recommends periodically decluttering your wardrobe. “Get all your clothing in one space – I call it the power of the pile. A lot of people aren’t aware of all the things they own, until they see it.”Decide which items to keep, and check them over for damage. Store things properly – Hassan teaches clients how to fold clothes, then stack them in an upright position, so you can see everything you own at once. “When you store things vertically, you’re less tempted to buy things, and more conscious with your consumerism … you know exactly what you own, and where it’s stored.”Store expensive items in cotton suit bags to prevent moth damage. (If you are on a budget, Winston-Hart suggests using an old single bedsheet, cutting a hole in it for a coathanger to poke through, then sewing up the sides for a DIY suit bag.)To get the most out of your footwear, ensure you look after the leather. “I tend to wear Timberland boots,” Ross tells me, “and every six weeks I wash off the dirt and put on a leather conditioner to keep them going for longer.” (He favours a brand called Nikwax.)It is not just footwear that you can treat to make it last longer: brands such as Polygiene use silver chloride technology, which is antimicrobial, to put a finish on fabrics. “If you have the finish on a polyester T-shirt, you can wear it for five years before it starts smelling,” claims Ross.“I have a deep relationship with my local tailor,” says De Castro. Once a year, she sorts through all her items, and then takes them in for repairs. “They’ll fix niggly things such as dropped hems, change the zips on evening gowns, or take things in and let them out.” When a pair of shoes starts to wear out, consider whether they can be resoled. Ross has worn the same pair of outdoor boots since 1985: the soles have been replaced six times.It is easy to do basic repairs yourself. “If you want to start repairing things and you’re not sure how to go about it, try out on some scrap fabric first,” says repairs expect Tom van Deijnen of the Visible Mending Programme. He recommends watching YouTube videos to learn basic skills, and asking family and friends for help. “In my experience, mothers and grandmothers always come up trumps,” he says.With worn-out jeans, Van Deijnen recommends sewing on patches. “Use a similar colour fabric, in the same weight as the original material – if it’s a woven fabric, patch it with a woven fabric, and if it’s a jersey fabric, use a jersey patch.”A common mistake people make when darning knitwear is to do it too tightly. “It doesn’t leave room for shrinking – sometimes threads can shrink when they are new. And if you pull the hole too tight, it can also cause a pucker, which creates tension in the fabric, meaning it will rip again.”Van Deijnen explains the best way to sew on a button. “Thread the needle, make some stitches in the fabric, then attach the button and sew it on. Do it a good few times. When you’ve finished, tug on the thread. If it comes loose, you didn’t do a good job.”Not every item can be repaired. “I’m quite adventurous and I’ll always give things ago, but sometimes things can be completely beyond repair,” says Van Deijnen. He recently had to bin a knitted tie that was riddled with moth eggs. The fabric disintegrated in his hands when he touched it, so he had no choice.When something can’t be fixed, think of alternate uses for it. “Everything can have another function at the end of its life,” says De Castro. She cuts up old swimsuits to use as hair ties (old tights are also good for this). And old T-shirts make the best cleaning rags.Donate intelligently. “Charity shops are brimming with our clothes,” says De Castro, “so you should only donate to charity what you think will sell. Otherwise, you’re dumping your problem on another organisation.” If you know it won’t sell – perhaps because it is old gym kit – take it to a textile-recycling bank where it can be turned into a new item. (Trainers can be recycled at branches of Runners Need.) The Love Your Clothes campaign has a textile bank locator, along with other resources, on its website.If you want your clothes to last, it can make sense to buy vintage: things made before 1980 tend to be made to a higher standard than modern items. “Even cheaply made 1970s trousers, if you turn them inside out, will resemble couture now,” says De Castro. But there is also a lot of factory-made fake vintage out there. How to tell? Look at details such as zips – is there a hook and eye to keep the zip in place? If not, it may be a fake. Other signs include 40s-style dresses with elasticated fabric – stretchy material wasn’t around then.Look after your vintage. “Armpit shields are really good,” says Winston-Hart. “They’re just cotton half-moons you attach with safety pins to your clothing under the armpits. You remove the pins and wash the pads themselves – which saves you having to wash the garment all the time.”Wearing a slip under a skirt means you don’t have to clean the skirt as often, as it is not touching your skin, cutting down on dry cleaning costs and reducing wear. If the slip is made out of silk, it will also help to regulate your body temperature. There are so many places to find secondhand treasures, whether it is a clothes swap with friends, charity shops or car boot sales. If you are a vintage aficionado, Winston-Hart recommends her favourite stores: Apple Tree Vintage, 1940s Style For You, Scarlet Rage Vintage, Blackout Vintage Fashion and Hunky Dory Vintage. (Many have online stores.) If vintage isn’t your thing, find more contemporary secondhand pieces on eBay or Depop. Sometimes, buying new clothes can be a sustainable choice – Hiut Denim will do free repairs on your jeans for life.It is not just about buying vintage or secondhand clothes. Ross talks about “emotional durability,” or the attachment to our most beloved clothes, because the most sustainable item in your wardrobe isn’t always the one that is ethically produced from non-polluting fabrics. It is the one you love, and will wear your whole life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78df69c7f317fd91f9aafad071494978d384d7ed/101_489_6272_3763/master/6272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c39c99b669a16e20eda7bc92b9aece4","title":"kim joys recipe for fruit and vegetable cookies","story":"Potato starch gives these miniature cookies a wonderful texture.

The forward was advised to rest by Juve’s medical staff due to muscle fatigue from a match played 48 hours earlier in Nanjing.The league sent a letter of protest to Juve over the alleged contract violation and the club’s chairman, Andrea Agnelli, responded on Wednesday. He denied claims that the Italian club had acted irresponsibly, and did not apologise for Ronaldo’s absence.On Thursday the K-League said Juventus’s response was filled with “untruth and deception” and demanded an apology.“K League clearly registers our profound indignation and disappointment to Juventus’ irresponsible behaviour and manners, and we strongly urge Juventus to offer a sincere apology and explain the reason for Ronaldo’s no-show,” the league said.“The key point … is that Ronaldo did not play even for a minute, contrary to the contract guarantee that he would play for at least 45 minutes. However, Juventus’s reply did not offer any apology nor did it explain what exactly happened that day.”The league also rejected Juve’s claims that a delay at the airport and heavy traffic en route to the stadium had forced the match to kick off later than scheduled.On Tuesday, it was revealed that irate football fans in South Korea were planning to pursue legal action, seeking compensation for the cost of tickets and “mental anguish” after Ronaldo’s failure to appear in the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74ccbae5fc23c17f07dbf696984c34f967050ed1/0_77_2496_1498/master/2496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73a8df9a8f5202ab41a69d999a47984f","title":"premier league 201920 preview no 8 everton","story":"Marco Silva has foundations to build on and after some shrewd signings should be aiming for Europa League qualification writers’ predicted position: 8th (NB: this is not necessarily Andy Hunter’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 150-1Grand designs for Everton’s proposed stadium have been unveiled 30 months after Bramley Moore dock was identified as the club’s preferred site and decades after the search for a new home began. Now it is a matter of securing planning permission, £500m of funding and overcoming Unesco world heritage concerns over a derelict location before construction can start on Farhad Moshiri’s plans for Everton’s future. In the meantime, the billionaire majority shareholder will expect to see progress on his substantial investment in Everton’s present. That too is overdue after several false starts.Unlike the stadium impressively envisaged by the architect Dan Meis, the manager Marco Silva has foundations to build on. For a sizeable chunk of last season – the three months bookended by the two Merseyside derbies, more or less – Silva appeared at risk of joining Sam Allardyce and Ronald Koeman on a lengthy list of poor appointments made on Moshiri’s watch. On this occasion the craving for stability, the appreciation of the mess Silva inherited and the desire to avoid another expensive managerial change prevailed. Everton were rewarded with a highly impressive finish to the manager’s debut campaign, one that not only showed his methods taking root but helped improve the fractured relationship between crowd and team. They have something to build on together.“The feeling of our fans and players enjoying what we are doing is everything I want as a manager,” Silva said after Everton’s humiliation of Manchester United in April. He elaborated: “Good goals, quality, solid without the ball and we kept pressing them high and never give them a chance to feel comfortable. We gave a quiet afternoon for our goalkeeper too.”That 4-0 lesson at Goodison Park, Everton’s biggest win over United in 35 years, was undoubtedly the high point of the season but not an isolated performance during the run-in. Everton won five of their final eight matches, keeping six clean sheets, including home victories against Chelsea, Arsenal and Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s sorry side. Of the starting XI against United the influential Idrissa Gueye and Kurt Zouma are no longer on Everton’s books, although Silva has not abandoned all hope of re-signing the Chelsea defender on a permanent basis. Gueye is a significant loss, having got his head down and flourished last season when others would have sulked after being denied a dream January move to Paris Saint-Germain.Both need replacing in what may prove a hectic end to the transfer window – with Mainz’s Jean-Philippe Gbamin earmarked as Gueye’s successor – and yet there is greater stability within the Everton squad than for several years. With United and Arsenal vulnerable, to say the least, Silva’s side are among those who see Europa League qualification and bridging the gap to the top six as achievable targets. Ending a trophy drought that has reached 24 years – the joint-longest in the club’s history (and the second world war was a factor in the other) – is also on the manager’s bonus list. As the imminent deal for the Juventus striker Moise Kean and £50m-plus bid for Wilfried Zaha confirm, there is work to be done beyond filling the gaps left by Zouma and Gueye.Everton ended last season strongly but an upturn that began with a committed draw against Liverpool in March, the last point taken from Jürgen Klopp’s challengers during the title race, was not without lapses. Silva’s side have some way to go to convince consistently. Their form nose-ed in December after Jordan Pickford’s error gifted Liverpool an injury-time winner at Anfield. That illustrated a recurring problem that drove the manager to distraction – the team’s tendency to lose focus andor confidence following a bad mistake or when conceding a goal against the run of play. A soft touch, in other words, which partly explains Everton’s move for an experienced title winner in Fabian Delph. The 29-year-old does not fit the transfer profile outlined by the director of football, Marcel Brands, who ideally wants to invest in players aged between 20 and 2526, but he was always prepared to make exceptions that represent good value. At an initial £8.5m from Manchester City, the England international fits that bill.Re-signing André Gomes on a permanent deal from Barcelona was a priority for Silva and accomplished for £22m plus a minimum of fuss. The manager will be looking to his compatriot to bring more leadership and not only shine when the going is good. Silva also wants to sign competition for Séamus Coleman at right back – most likely a loan – while the Italy international Kean represents the latest attempt to solve a longstanding problem in Everton’s attack. At 19, the Juventus academy product can not guarantee consistency in front of goal but he is an exciting, intriguing capture that reflects the club’s desire to build long term. He also eases the burden on Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who thrived with the backing of Silva and the crowd during a much-needed run at centre-forward last season but is the first to admit his finishing must improve.Silva, now assisted by the former Arsenal and Fulham striker Luís Boa Morte, believes Everton can compete for the top six with a few key additions. He oversaw a vast improvement in Gylfi Sigurdsson, Michael Keane and Calvert-Lewin last season while, with the exception of Yerry Mina, every signing made last summer enhanced the side. But another eighth-placed finish was not what Silva, Brands, Moshiri, Lucas Digne, Richarlison, Bernard and others signed up for. It is time to push on, both on the pitch and on the dock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f553c39901a8c3bcc99f1206ef24bdef3943f83/0_111_5656_3394/master/5656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40990f80697a414bc1fa0a910127dc8d","title":"were not afraid to lead myanmar displaced find a new voice","story":"Fearful for their safety, many of the 241,000 people forced from their homes by conflict in Myanmar are reluctant to go back. Now campaigners are mobilising to resist organised returnsBawk Nu Awng hasn’t been home since 2011. All three of the villages where she spent her childhood have been destroyed.“War hit wherever my family lived,” she said. “I feel like it is my responsibility to engage in all matters related to peace.”Now aged 21, Bawk Nu Awng, from Kachin in Myanmar, has emerged as a spokesperson among youth displaced by conflict.When Aung San Suu Kyi took power in 2016, her party, the National League for Democracy, pledged to prioritise ending conflict in Myanmar. Yet the country’s various ethnic groups continue to fight for increased federal autonomy.In Rakhine state, conflict is escalating between Myanmar’s military, known as the Tatmadaw, and the rebel Arakan Army. Nationwide, an estimated 241,000 people like Bawk Nu Awng remain in camps, including more than 97,000 in Kachin state.Camps for internally displaced people are the most visible evidence of Myanmar’s ongoing strife. With elections coming up next year, political momentum to send displaced people home has accelerated.Kachin, which shares a border with China’s Yunnan province, is a strategic area for China’s belt and road initiative, a global development strategy that includes a multi-billion pound China-Myanmar economic corridor. In March, Yunnan officials met with the influential Kachin Baptist Convention support for returns and a peace agreement was encouraged, with the Chinese contingent suggesting stability could bring investment and development.In December, the Tatmadaw offered a short unilateral ceasefire, since extended to 31 August, to three ethnic armies in northern Myanmar including the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).Shortly after the announcement, the first organised returns occurred, the Tatmadaw accompanying a group of displaced people back to the village of Nam San Yang, despite having deactivated land mines only weeks before. Talks have since been held between the government and the Kachin Humanitarian Concern Committee, a group headed by church leaders that mediates on returns. No displaced people have been included in the meetings.In early June, longtime activist Lum Zawng, 30, brought together 43 young displaced people in the state capital, Myitkyina, to discuss their perspective on returns. Nawng Lat, 31, who was at that meeting alongside Bawk Nu Awng, said: “We urgently had to form a group to think deeply about our returns and raise our voice.”The group developed a statement, published on Facebook, stating that returns should only happen when safety and dignity could be assured, and when people have been consulted and are free to decide when to return without pressure or force being applied. It also stated that displaced people should not be used for political, economic or social advantage.Nawng Lat, who is from Nam San Yang village, was not part of the group that returned. He is eager to go home, but only when conditions are right. When fighting resumed eight years ago, he never imagined living in a camp for so long. “My first thought was that the war would last a few months,” he says. “After about three years, everything became unsure. I wondered why it was happening, why we couldn’t go back.”Now he is among more than 38,000 displaced people living in areas outside the government’s jurisdiction. With limited access to higher education and jobs, many young people leave for China in search of livelihoods, where they are vulnerable to trafficking and abuse.“The longer we stay in IDP camps, the more problems we face,” he says. “I don’t want returns to happen under pressure. I’m not saying we don’t want to go back actually, we are eager to back as soon as possible. It’s been eight years since we have been displaced and we have lost so many things related to our education and development. We will only return after we have a security guarantee.”Bawk Nu Awng wants a guarantee that landmines have been cleared: “Currently, it is like they want us to stay in a house that is not fully built. When it rains, it will leak. Only after they have fully built the house should we stay in it. There needs to be trust. In June, the activists staged a public drama performance to commemorate the war’s eighth anniversary. Pau Lu and fellow organiser Seng Nu Pan informed the authorities yet, moments before the performance, police turned up claiming that extra permissions were required. The event was moved and went ahead, but Pau Lu and Seng Nu Pan were charged with holding an unauthorised protest. They now face a maximum three-month prison sentence in the ongoing case.The incident is one of several in which activists have faced criminal charges. In April last yea,r Lum Zawng and fellow activists Zau Jat and Nang Pu received a six-month prison sentence for defaming the Tatmadaw by leading a demonstration demanding safe passage and humanitarian access to 2,000 villagers trapped during a period of escalated fighting.Bawk Nu Awng says fear makes people reluctant to act: “Some are afraid of engaging in politics … My parents don’t want me to participate because they are afraid I will get shot or arrested.”Released during an annual presidential amnesty, Lum Zawng said arresting activists serves as a “psychological threat”.Seng Nu Pan says arrests only “push us to do more”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29e3d8e5dce0eca0463170c0f400f5193e87010d/201_135_2785_1672/master/2785.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c4056ffb1082e3c769d70f1f1b48691","title":"severn bridge services named as worst on englands motorways","story":"Visitors criticise ‘grim’ toilets and fly-infested restaurant at services on M48 near BristolA motorway service station overlooking the Severn Bridge has been named the worst in England after visitors criticised its unwelcoming 1960s exterior and “grim and dismal” toilets.Norton Canes (Roadchef) services between junctions 6 and 7 of the M6 toll road in Staffordshire was rated the best for the second year running in the survey by the independent watchdog Transport Focus.The results are published on Thursday in the watchdog’s third annual Motorway Services User Survey, in which 11,600 drivers were questioned on issues such as the state of the buildings and toilets, food and drink, and staff friendliness.Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus, said: “Motorway users tell us they have a good experience when visiting service areas, but it’s clear that many do not feel the experience is good value for money. They want pleasant, well-maintained facilities with good-quality food choices.“Motorway services continue to play an important safety role providing drivers with the opportunity to take a break.

On one hand, they are a godsend for toilet breaks, relief from monotonous hours on the motorway and the chance for a nap or wake-up coffee.

She and her band, Les Filles de Illighadad, are now taking the world by stormLes Filles de Illighadad are in their dressing room, listening to music on their phones and scrolling through social media apps. Fatou Seidi Ghali, the band’s lead guitarist and singer, leans in to show me a Snapchat she has just received from a friend: in a hilly desert, a white-robed man is riding a horse at full speed. He tries to stand up in the saddle and falls off into a plume of sand. Fatou looks up at me, laughing.The group are from a small village called Illighadad in the Tuareg region of the Sahara in western Niger. While the region has produced some celebrated guitarists, acts such as Bombino, Mdou Moctar and Tinariwen’s Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, Fatou is the first ever Tuareg woman to play guitar professionally.She started the band in 2016 with her cousin Alamnou Akrouni, who plays percussion and sings. A third member, Mariama Salah Aswan, recently left to start a family and was replaced by Fatimata Ahmadelher, the Tuareg’s second-ever female guitarist, who also contributes vocals and percussion. They are in their late 20s, they say, although they have no birth certificates. Fatou’s brother, Abdoulaye Madassane, joins them on tour, providing rhythm guitar.Another brother, Ahmoudou, introduced Fatou to the instrument, albeit inadvertently, when he brought one home from Libya. Fatou, aged about 10, began teaching herself to play in secret, sneaking off to practise every time her brother was out. The sight of a woman holding the guitar was in itself controversial. “My father told me to stop wasting my time,” says Fatou, talking through an interpreter. “That I should be busy looking after the cows.” But she persisted, and people began to take notice.Among them was Christopher Kirkley, a music fan from Portland, Oregon, who started the record label Sahel Sounds in 2010 as a way of bringing south-Saharan music to a wider audience. He had heard about Fatou playing guitar at weddings, and managed to track her down. After hearing her play at home in the village, Kirkley recorded Les Filles’ eponymous first album, with Alamnou playing tende, a traditional Tuareg goatskin drum, and Fatou playing fingerpicked blues on an acoustic guitar. They play folksongs they have known all their lives – love songs and odes to nomadic life – with the sound of local people laughing and singing along in the background.Tende music, named after the drum, is played at traditional Tuareg courting rituals, where all the women in a village sing to each other in a call-and-response style. As they sing, men approach on camelback, trying to catch the eye of a potential suitor while the camels’ hooves move in time with the music.How important is music to the Tuareg? This question elicits quizzical looks. “Everyone listens. Everyone plays,” says Fatimata.“For love, for pain, for enjoyment,” adds Abdoulaye. “When there is tension in the village, musicians come to calm everyone down.” Different occasions require different kinds of music, tende being one and takamba, a faster style built around a three- or four-stringed loot instrument known as the ngoni, is another, often played at weddings.Fatou played the ngoni before she ever picked up a guitar. She created Les Filles’ sound by combining these influences – tende, takamba and hausa music, a folk style from Nigeria. The band’s success means she is treated “like a queen” when she returns home, with local people asking for photos and offering motorcycle lifts wherever she goes. She is modest when I ask what she hopes to achieve with her band: “Helping the village, buying medicines, supporting my brothers and sisters.”We meet shortly after their performance at the Womad festival, and Fatou and Fatimata are arguing heatedly in Tamasheq, their native tongue. The gig didn’t go well, at least not in their view. The sound engineers struggled with the calabash – a pumpkin-like fruit cut in half and partly submerged in water, drummed to mimic camels’ hooves – and the band had to swap instruments a few times to try to get rid of the feedback. The crowd was enraptured nonetheless.Like the , Womad recently removed “world music” from its lexicon to avoid the inadequacy of grouping together hundreds of geographically disparate genres. The festival’s name recalls another term that may be more fitting for Les Filles: “nomad” is a tag worn proudly by the Sahara-roaming Tuareg people, and an equivalent Tamasheq word, amahegh, meaning a Tuareg of noble heart, translates as “free man”. As they continue on a world tour that has already taken them to Australia, Israel, Sweden and Canada, Les Filles are giving the words new meaning.Les Filles de Illighadad’s world tour continues. Their second album, Eghass Malan (Sahel Sounds), is out now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e615cdd18b3f894776ff97bf87fcc67e13a0f6d/2116_1320_1761_1057/master/1761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69a251ed01dbcddd235a6cb12f015724","title":"ludovico einaudi review italian composer barbican london","story":"Barbican, LondonThe Italian composer’s musical language is pitifully narrow and he is a limited pianist. The audience appear to be mesmerised – but there’s nothing to listen toThe past few weeks have told us more than we want to know about the relentlessly acclamatory optimism of powerful people for whom detail is a mere inconvenience. Like our new PM, the Italian composer Ludovico Einaudi is a populist who has no problem persuading audiences to come out and listen. Tonight’s concert is the first of seven sell-out evenings at the Barbican devoted to his work. And yet his message proves stubbornly empty, unmemorable and humourless – music patched together from cute melodic soundbites and occasional outbursts of bombast.On paper, it looks audacious. Seven Days Walking is described as a “sprawling and ambitious new project” inspired by winter walks in the mountains near Einaudi’s Italian home. We are promised dramatic fresh perspectives on the same recurring material, which will “reveal new details each time”. This two-hour slab of music, played by Einaudi himself on piano, with Federico Mecozzi (violin) and Redi Hasa (cello) is, confusingly, described as both the “first instalment” and “excepts” in a not terribly helpful programme book – but the material feels so featherweight, and interchangeable between different sections, I’m not sure this matters.In the Barbican hall, mean-and-moody dry ice wafts around floating bubbles (meant to be snowflakes?) projected on to a backdrop as a pre-recorded harp chimes like church bells in the distance. Einaudi and his musicians walk on stage shrouded in darkness and mystery, and reasonable expectation builds. With an entrance like that, surely they’re about to deliver material of real import and expressive weight. Instead, as Einaudi strikes up his band, the humdrum ordinariness and straightforwardness is stupefying. The effect is that of a standup comedian, who you’re expecting to flip reality on its head with some devastatingly withering and pointed gag, who can only muster “Buses, eh? You wait 20 minutes and then two turn up at once.”Einaudi’s music speaks fluent cliche. He might have once been a pupil of the influential Italian modernist composer Luciano Berio, and claim jazz, folk and rock influences, but his musical language is pitifully narrow and getting smaller. Any sense of adventure and exploration, of opening himself up to new perspectives and details, is eschewed. It’s as if Einaudi has started from everything he knows and cannily pureed his musical vocabulary down to an inventory of generic, soulless chord sequences – sad minor tone sighs, affirmative slips into the major, water-treading arpeggios, anthemic fanfares – each designed to push emotional buttons as shamelessly as a Simon Cowell Christmas No 1.This ruthless stamping on any tension, conflict or internal discussion – anything that might pump some much needed life through the music’s veins – is extended to the sound relayed back into the hall, which is caked in icky reverb and ambient echo. The intention seems to be to recreate the antiseptic environment of a recording studio. Unfortunately, Einaudi is such a limited pianist, with no range of colour, timbre or attack, that this filtering of each note through the sound desk transforms his monochrome technique into something unpalatably synthetic. A woman sitting near me leaves after 20 minutes. Perhaps she’s had enough. Otherwise Einaudi has his audience mesmerised. But I wonder why – there’s nothing to listen to.• Seven Days Walking is at the Barbican, London, until 6 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df23da3b1559172ff8e6b41e776b2040677cd453/0_302_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f654751ac775a0f618509ef69e30fadb","title":"mabel high expectations review","story":"(Polydor)On her undeniably hit-making debut, the daughter of Neneh Cherry sings ‘I’m not a people pleaser’ over backings intent on pleasing as many as possibleThe title of Mabel McVey’s debut album seems less like an expression of thrusting youthful ambition than a statement of fact. High Expectations arrives with her current single Mad Love just outside the Top 10, and its predecessor, Don’t Call Me Up, still lurking around the charts a full six months after its release. Excited voices are calling her the next Dua Lipa, which sounds like faint praise – with the greatest of respect, it doesn’t quite have the hyperbolic cachet of the next Dylan or the next Madonna – until you realise that Dua Lipa is basically the only British pop artist who isn’t Ed Sheeran to have broken America in eons. They don’t want our rappers, however much Drake tries to convince them otherwise they evince no interest in our massed ranks of earnest post-Sheeran acoustic troubadours, but it’s multiplatinum hits and million-selling albums up the wazoo for the New Rules singer.From the outside at least, McVey’s path to this point has seemed remarkably smooth: the first song she posted to SoundCloud in 2015 ended up being played on Radio 1 and securing her a major label deal three of her subsequent singles went platinum. Don’t Call Me Up has been a hit not just in the UK but the US, hence the Dua Lipa comparisons. So smooth, in fact, that McVey has been at pains to point out that nepotism has nothing to do with it. She certainly comes from hip music industry stock – her mum is Neneh Cherry, her father Cameron McVey was the executive producer of Massive Attack’s Blue Lines – but anyone searching for sonic evidence of her lineage on High Expectations is going to go home disappointed. It goes fangs-out for the 2019 pop jugular, with a host of familiar names on hand to help ensure its success is as much of a foregone conclusion as possible: Steve Mac, whose hit-making career stretches back to mid-90s boybands Damage and 5ive and whose recent songwriting successes include Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You and Clean Bandit’s Rockabye and Symphony Fraser T Smith of Adele and Stormzy fame MNEK, co-author of Dua Lipa’s IDGAF among others and Jimmy Napes, whose fingerprints are on huge chunks of both Sam Smith albums.On the plus side, that helps ensure the songs are uniformly well turned. There’s a certain bullish confidence about the fact that most of McVey’s previous hits are confined to bonus-track status, and if nothing leaps out in quite the same way as Don’t Call Me Up, nor is there much in the way of obvious filler: there’s a lot of hooky razzle-dazzle about the choruses of Bad Behaviour and Selfish Love it’s no stretch of the imagination to picture even the relatively low-key We Don’t Say or Trouble taking up residence in the Top 40. In the debit column, however, playlist-fuelled 2019 pop prizes a certain homogeneity: a scan of the singles chart over the 27 weeks that Don’t Call Me Up has been hanging around strongly suggests that no mainstream pop artist other than Lil Nas X is currently making it big as a result of their devastating originality and penchant for recklessly tearing up the rules. There’s a weird disjunction between McVey’s lyrics, which are big on telling you what a caution-to-the-winds handful she is, and the music that supports them, which sticks pretty fast to the well-made pop-R\u0026ampB playbook: “I’m not a people pleaser,” she sings on Bad Behaviour, over a backing that’s clearly intent on pleasing as many people as possible.High Expectations could use a couple more moments like that, although it probably doesn’t need them to be a huge success: it’s got the big killer pop hit and a tracklist thick with potential follow-ups. As it is, you’re left with a solid, well-made pop album that occasionally hints its maker might be more interesting and inidual: time will show if that’s the case, but the immediate future seems secure.Marika Hackman: All NightAs sultry as the weather, at least at the time of writing, Hackman’s “overtly sexual song about a woman” is a small-hours gem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c37bb9a6b2005b8f6652993517eb00f1028935a/0_813_4093_2455/master/4093.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=993e52dc6fd43c77ce7850f28b4b4022","title":"miles daviss 20 greatest albums ranked","story":"With his lost 1985 album Rubberband out in September, and the 50th anniversary of In a Silent Way – released this week – we count down the jazz icon’s finest momentsIn the end, Miles Davis would fascinate jazz, rock and classical fans alike. But in the 1940s he had been a teenage trumpet hopeful partnering Charlie Parker and by 1954, when this session was recorded, he had an understatedly personal version of the revolutionary bebop sound. Alongside Sonny Rollins and Thelonious Monk, he reveals it here.A patchily intriguing set from the next decade, flagging the ever-changing Miles’ migration from free-swinging jazz to rock. The saxophonist Wayne Shorter broods, the embryonic soul-star George Benson plays terse guitar, Herbie Hancock debuts the formerly unjazzy Fender Rhodes and Tony Williams drums up a perfect storm.Miles comprehensively burned out in 1975, but while his comeback six years later was uncertain, his 1970s edginess was now softened by the rediscovery of his early lyricism. Good originals such as Back Seat Betty, with its wistful trumpet and hard-thumbed Marcus Miller bass hooks, entered the repertoire.Marcus Miller, Miles’s 1980s svengali, scored and glossily produced this late-career set dedicated to South Africa’s liberation from apartheid. It’s a bit lightweight for its subject, but the Jaco Pastorius tribute is both swinging and soulful, and the title ballad is bittersweet acoustic Miles at his most poignant.Audacious but sympathetic remixes by imaginative producerplayer Bill Laswell, of music from Miles’s heavily experimental 1970s period, including In a Silent Way. While Laswell’s echoey, bass-pumping, beat-swelling treatments sometimes twist the originals way out of shape, their creator’s spirit runs through it all.The director Louis Malle hired a Paris-loving, 31-year-old Miles and a FrenchUS band including the bebop drummer Kenny Clarke to improvise a soundtrack for his noirish 1958 thriller L’Ascenseur Pour L’Echafaud (Lift to the Scaffold). Going only by the visuals, the trumpeter reflected the movie’s desolate romanticism perfectly.Bill Laswell, Miles’s posthumous remixer, called 1972’s On the Corner “mutant hip-hop” – others have heard dub, pre-punk, drum’n’bass and more in its oceanic, thick-textured, harmony-purged turmoil of multiple keyboards, overdubs, saxes and percussion. Long ignored, the session is on its way to rehabilitation.Miles preferred patience, tension, release and expressiveness of tone to the torrents of notes that often characterised bebop. This classy 50s compilation, including the saxophonist Jackie McLean, pianist Horace Silver and drummer Art Blakey, features both his ballad elegance and some of his most surefooted improv over a bop groove.Miles buffs refer to his “first and second great quintets”. The second was the 1960s group including Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams. This, with saxophonist John Coltrane, is the dazzling first. The contrast between the reticent, incisive trumpeter and the unquenchable Coltrane is mesmerising.In 1985, Denmark’s government awarded Miles Davis its normally classical Sonning prize, and Danish trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg wrote an orchestral suite for the star and – somehow – persuaded him to play on it. Superb solos from an engaged and attentive Miles, navigating Mikkelborg’s references to all kinds of 20th-century music.Miles’s last session for Columbia Records, notably including beautiful interpretations of two pop songs – Cyndi Lauper’s Time After Time and Michael Jackson’s Human Nature. Also striking is guitar newcomer John Scofield’s fast and convoluted title-track blues, one of the great original compositions for a late-period Miles lineup.The dense, dark, Latin-fusion epic Bitches Brew was a landmark of production as well as musicianship from a superb band including Wayne Shorter, John McLaughlin, Chick Corea and Jack DeJohnette. The players improvised for hours the producer, Teo Macero, and Miles cut-and-pasted the results into distinct tracks later.Along with Kind of Blue, Milestones is a masterpiece from the 1950s quintet including John Coltrane – expanded to a sextet here by gospel-y alto saxophonist Julian “Cannonball” Adderley. The springy, airborne title track is a standout, as is the leader’s incisive improv on Thelonious Monk’s Straight, No Chaser.Most at ease in small groups, Miles Davis was also a poetic soloist in concerto-like roles with a big band. His long and fruitful relationship with the Canadian composerarranger Gil Evans gets a spectacular airing on Spanish themes including the smouldering Concierto de Aranjuez, and the quietly conversational Solea.Maybe the best-ever representation of “the second great quintet” at work. Superbly recorded live at Chicago’s Plugged Nickel club, the set finds Miles, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams reinventing small-band jazz with an all-but-psychic flexibility of timing and on-the-fly harmonising.The young Miles wanted to play bebop’s revolutionary conceptions in a more ethereal, less impatient way than its first pioneers. With likeminded souls including saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and Lee Konitz, and the composerarranger Gil Evans, he formed this delicately groundbreaking chamber ensemble, an influence on the jazz sound still.A beautiful makeover of the Gershwin opera – give or take a little shaky section playing in the under-rehearsed band – with Miles’s trumpet soaring over a Gil Evans-arranged orchestra. His exhortations over the shouts of the band on Prayer, and his supple, gliding solo on Summertime are standouts.From a film-score assignment about boxing legend Jack Johnson, Miles launched a new band (hiring Stevie Wonder bassist Michael Henderson among others) and built a thrillingly hard-rocking sound out of long studio jams and radical editing. The seeds of his next five years are in this uncompromising music.Time stands still on this 1969 Davis classic. Electric sounds and textures (notably from new guitarist John McLaughlin and keyboardist Joe Zawinul) make clear breaks from the trumpeter’s acoustic bands – but Miles’s horn and Wayne Shorter’s keening soprano sax sketch passages of an exquisite, irresistible tranquillity.Revered by pundits and fans, radiating an enduringly contemporary sound, and with un-jazz-like sales of 4 million plus at the last count, Kind of Blue – the 1959 session recorded in just a few hours and with minimal rehearsal – changed the way listeners and practitioners everywhere heard and made music. The Milestones band, with John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley on saxes, was the core, with the graceful pianist Bill Evans added, and the use of modes rather than song chords throughout gave the music an ethereal, free-associative spaciousness that draws new audiences to jazz to this day.Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema - ranked!Michael Caine\u0027s best films - ranked!The 10 best Glenn Close movies - ranked!Tom Cruise - top 20 movies - ranked!Judi Dench - every film - ranked!Ryan Gosling movies - ranked!10 best Hugh Grant films - ranked!Nicole Kidman’s top 10 films - ranked!The best and the worst Jennifer Lopez films - ranked!All Helen Mirren\u0027s 61 movies - ranked!Robert Redford\u0027s greatest screen roles - ranked!Winona Ryder\u0027s 20 best films - ranked!Movie Santa Clauses - ranked!Jason Statham - every film - ranked!Emma Thompson\u0027s best films - ranked!Biopics trashed by families, friends and fans - ranked!Purr evil: cats in movies with hidden agendas - ranked!Dog weepie movies - ranked!Top 20 J-horror films - ranked!Movies that have grossed more than $1bn - ranked!Palme d\u0027Or winners - ranked!The scariest horror films ever - ranked!The best Shakespeare films - ranked!The 10 best movie shark performances - ranked!Worst holidays in cinema - ranked!James Bond on film – 007\u0027s best and worst movies - ranked!The 20 best Marvel films - ranked!Top 10 Merchant Ivory films - ranked!Pixar - every film ever made - ranked!Planet of the Apes - the best and worst of the movies - ranked!Star Wars - every film - ranked!The 20 best music documentaries - ranked!The weirdest Brits performances - ranked!Game of Thrones - every episode - ranked!Oscar nominees - the weirdest ever - ranked!Oscar snubs - the 20 greatest ever - ranked!The biggest Rock \u0026amp Roll Hall of Fame snubs ever - ranked!Super Bowl half-time shows - the 10 greatest - ranked!The best X Factor finalists - ranked!From Niall Horan\u0027s toast to Russell Crowe’s jockstrap: celebrity auction items - ranked!All Abba\u0027s UK singles - ranked!Every one of Madonna\u0027s 78 singles - ranked!Kate Bush – every UK single - ranked!Queen\u0027s 50 UK singles - ranked!Taylor Swift\u0027s singles - ranked!The Who: their UK singles - ranked!Black Sabbath - every album - ranked!David Byrne – (almost) all of his albums - ranked!Miles Davis\u0027s 20 greatest albums – ranked!Lil Wayne\u0027s albums - ranked!Every Mercury prize-winning album - ranked!The Rolling Stones – every album - ranked!10 best Paul Simon albums - ranked!Bruce Springsteen\u0027s albums - ranked!Kanye West – every album - ranked!Stevie Wonder\u0027s albums - ranked!20 greatest breakup songs ever - ranked!Aphex Twin\u0027s best songs - ranked!Barry Manilow – all his greatest songs - ranked!Cher\u0027s 30 greatest songs - ranked!The 30 greatest Disney songs –\u0026nbspranked!Elton John\u0027s 50 greatest songs - ranked!From Drake to Wet Wet Wet: songs with 10 weeks at No 1 - ranked!From MC5 to Jeff Mills: the greatest Detroit tracks ever - ranked!Giorgio Moroder\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!Nirvana\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!The best songs from teen movies - ranked!The best UK garage tracks - ranked!The greatest banned songs of all time - ranked!The greatest ever female rap tracks - ranked!The greatest pop music dance crazes - ranked!All 43 Spice Girls songs - ranked!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcfe59549992952d27c14827702c2b324bac4ff1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1004c36ecf49815729edcbe6d936ff83","title":"a sneaker peek behind the scenes at new balance","story":"Since 1982, New Balance has produced its flagship 990s at one of two US factories. We take a look at the craftsmanship that goes into each trainer at the site in MassachusettsFew trainers can claim a fanbase as erse as that of the New Balance 990 series. The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it. I know what I want to do, but they are experts and the value they add is incredible,” he says.And the atmosphere on the line embodies that spirit of collaboration. The workers move quickly – they each have just 22.5 seconds to complete their task – but still find moments to greet each other warmly.Luis Puello, a 51-year-old leather cutter, carefully runs his hands across a sheet of pig’s hide, looking for defects that he marks with a laser before a machine makes a cut. Over the years, he says, he has developed a better feel for the leather, quickly sensing which parts will function best in different areas of the shoe.He smiles when asked what he thinks about the 990s that he helps make every day. “When the job is done, you see what you’ve done, and you feel proud,” he says.New Balance’s 990v5s are available at the New Balance London flagship store or newbalance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45c4c0421651847b2fb3c89c779c96825af739a/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9104a8fbe287510bd6c4115b3bfdbaa","title":"the evolution of the new balance 99x series in pictures","story":"The New Balance 990v5 – which was released in the UK in May this year – is the latest trainer in a 37-year footwear dynasty.

Otherwise you’re basing actual lawmaking on the belief women lie.”Buckland said he agreed that “particular crimes should not be singled out, particularly sexual allegations”.No 10 said Buckland, a former criminal barrister, was not announcing any change approved by the prime minister. “This is not government policy,” Johnson’s spokesman said.The Ministry of Justice also moved to distance itself from Buckland’s comments, saying: “This isn’t departmental policy.” It said Buckland would not be giving further interviews on the subject and it would now be handled by Downing Street.In his interview with the Times, Buckland suggested an accused person’s previous reputation could play a part in whether they were granted anonymity.“Let’s say you are a reputable local business person who is accused of fraud,” he said. “Your good name is going to be really undermined by this mere accusation. That might be a meritorious case for anonymity.“Let’s say you are a person with a list of previous convictions. You’ve committed offences. There is intelligence out there that suggests that other victims might come forward. Is that a case where anonymity should be automatic?”Ian Murray, the director of the Society of Editors, said it was “absurd to suggest that in a liberal democracy we are going to create a system of justice that enables the rich, the powerful and celebrities to be protected when they are under investigation for serious crimes but the ordinary man or woman would be offered no such protections.”Murray said there was a slippery slope towards a situation where the actions of the police could not be scrutinised and arrests could not be publicised. “This is surely one of the worst aspects of a totalitarian state,” he said.The Independent Group for Change party leader, Anna Soubry, also a former criminal barrister, said she backed a proposal where “all suspects (whatever the allegation) should not be named until charge save for exceptional circumstances and with leave of crown court judge”.Daniel Janner, the son of the late Labour peer Greville Janner who was the subject of sexual offence allegations before his death, which his family have fiercely denied, said he was heartened by Buckland’s comments.Janner, the founder of Falsely Accused Iniduals for Reform (Fair), which is backed by Richard, said: “This will introduce fairness into the criminal justice system and is a reform that is long overdue. I am proud that Fair, with the support of singer Sir Cliff Richard and DJ Paul Gambaccini and others, appears to have changed the laws of this country for the good.”Gambaccini was arrested in 2013 over sexual offence allegations and publicly named in the case. Police took almost a year to announce he would not face charges as there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him.Similarly, Richard was named after his Berkshire flat was raided in 2014 and he publicly denied sexual offence allegations before police confirmed he would not be charged in 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f07e58ca548e7fa09e3531a0bb07174d194a741d/0_16_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b8f5baded07fe1272325641c45b6dc2","title":"the view from brecon and radnorshire voters byelection","story":"Voters share their opinions in Welsh town where Lib Dems and Brexit party hope to steal Tory votesGreg Collins, a 53-year-old care worker, waved off the bright turquoise open-topped Brexit party bus as it began one of its final grand tours of the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency and declared that Nigel Farage’s candidate would be getting his vote.“I was a Labour supporter for a long time but they have let us down – Tony Blair lied over the Iraq war,” said Collins. “The Lib Dems helped bring austerity on us so I won’t have anything to do with them.”And the Tories? Collins, it turns out, was one of 150 or so people who stood in the drizzle outside Brecon Guildhall this week hoping to get a glimpse of the new prime minister when he visited mid-Wales before Thursday’s byelection. But the crowd was left disappointed, with Boris Johnson only making a flying visit to an enterprise park on the fringe of the town rather than meeting and greeting the voters.“I was keen to see him and if I’d have had the chance I’d have liked to speak to him,” said Collins. “I waited there for nearly two hours and he didn’t turn up. The common man gets stiffed all the time. I’m voting for Mr Farage this time and if he turns out to be a liar, I won’t vote again.”In truth, the byelection is just about the last thing Johnson needs. It is his first major test as prime minister and if, as is widely expected, the Liberal Democrats win, his working majority in the Commons will be reduced to just one.The Brexit party candidate, Des Parkinson, a former police chief superintendent, called the Tory decision to put Davies up again as arrogant. “He’s doing the Tory cause here no good.”Activists for the Brexit party have flooded in. Diana Coad, a Tory defector from Berkshire, was running the buzzing Brecon campaign office on Wednesday – and making sure those getting on the bus had been to the toilet before departure. “They’re a smashing bunch. They come from all over,” she said.One absentee is Farage. The Brexit party MEP Nathan Gill explained that the leader was spending time in the US “with his friend Donald Trump” and also planning a much larger campaign.“We’re in general election mode,” said Gill. “He’s got to make sure we’re fighting fit and ready for the big one.” Gill said he thought there would be a general election on 24 October. “Put a fiver on it.”In 2017 the results were as follows:\u0026nbspDespite the guilty verdict in court and the successful recall petition, Conservatives\u0027 Chris Davies is standing again and will hope to retain the seat. If he doesn\u0027t, new prime minister Boris Johnson will find his tiny working majority in parliament further diminished.Jane Dodds is standing for the Liberal Democrats, and Tom Davies is standing for Labour. The Brexit Party will be represented by Des Parkinson.In a move intended to to avoid splitting the \u0027remain\u0027 vote in the constituency, the Green party and Plaid Cymru have decided not to stand candidates, urging their supporters to back Dodds and the Lib Dems.Lady Lily Pink is standing for the Monster Raving Loony party.Of course, not everyone was impressed by the bright blue bus and the Brexit party bluster.Les, a sheep farmer, was taking his ease in the sunshine when the vehicle drove through Brecon town centre. “They’re the sort that are here today, gone tomorrow,” he said.Agriculture has been at the centre of this campaign with warnings of heartache for sheep farmers and even civil unrest if the UK leaves the EU with no deal.Les voted for remain and will be backing the Lib Dems at the byelection. “Boris is thinking he can get a deal. I very much doubt he can. With him in charge we’re heading for a no deal. That’s a bad job for us. All the work we’ve done will be undone. It will mean a big adjustment.”Three doors along from the Brexit party office, the Lib Dem campaign HQ was even more lively. The Lib Dems held this seat between 1997 and 2015 and believe they will win it back.Candy Piercy had just arrived from Buckinghamshire to help the party’s candidate Jane Dodds. A veteran of byelections up and down the country, Piercy said she was shocked the Tories had chosen Davies to stand again. “I wonder if it’s because they want to blame him for losing it,” she said.Kirsty Williams, the Lib Dem Welsh assembly member for Brecon and Radnorshire, said the campaign was not just about farming and Brexit.“But when they are not talking about Brexit they want to talk about public expenditure, about infrastructure, austerity and hyper-local issues such as is the library going to survive.”Williams criticised Johnson’s no-show in the town centre – a stark contrast to the efforts of the new Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, who has visited four times.“Quite clearly this was a very stage-managed visit with extensive care taken to avoid scrutiny,” she said. “In a constituency particularly vulnerable to no-deal Brexit, local people are right to expect the Conservatives to explain why they are pursuing it. The fact they shied away speaks volumes.”Davies, however, said he did not regret standing. “The support I’ve had from the people of Brecon and Radnorshire has been immense,” he said. “These aren’t just constituents. They are former clients, friends, family. It was they that encouraged me to stand again.”He insisted he had not meant to commit an offence over his expenses – which concerned the submitting of fake invoices for nine framed landscape photographs, costing £700, to decorate his office in the town of Builth Wells.“I regret making a mistake, clearly. A mistake was made in my paperwork. This was a legitimate expense. There was no financial gain. It was a pure mistake and I’ve paid a heavy price.”Asked whether he was sorry for causing his new leaders such a headache, he said: “There are many things the prime minister will have a headache over. I’m sure this byelection is one of them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e1e451b584a678b6a7d2590f429579188fba7f6/0_140_6075_3645/master/6075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=889f6871123ba879eb2597c89d67ce22","title":"alcohol minimum price law obeyed across scotland says report","story":"Scotland’s pioneering policy of minimum pricing for alcohol has been successfully implemented, with compliance high across the country, according to the first report to evaluate its effectiveness.The study by NHS Health Scotland also welcomed the policy as having “the potential to improve Scotland’s relationship with alcohol and reduce the harm it causes”.Minimum unit pricing (MUP) for all alcoholic drinks, set at 50p a unit, was eventually introduced in May last year after repeated attempts led by the Scotch Whisky Association to derail the proposals in the courts.Scottish ministers believe the policy, which means a standard bottle of whisky (700ml) must cost at least £14 and a two-litre bottle of cider £5, will save approximately 400 lives over the next five years and lead to about 8,000 fewer alcohol-related hospital admissions.The report, which collated the experiences of police and local authority officials with a licensing remit, found that there had been no increase in illegal and unlicensed alcohol activity since the law was introduced, while pubs, clubs and restaurants, which typically charge higher prices for drink than off-licences and supermarkets, had been largely unaffected by the policy.One of the greatest risks of non-compliance was found along the border with England, where some retailers remained uncertain which licensing regime they fell under.Officials working in border areas also reported they were aware of people obtaining their home delivery shopping from stores located in England because MUP would not apply to the online purchases.The report noted anecdotal evidence of people going to stores in England to stock up on alcohol for themselves or their friends.The report also identified smaller retailers using the policy as an excuse to increase their prices on alcohol products not affected by MUP. One licensing standards officer said: “A lot of them have used the minimum unit price as an opportunity to just creep up all of their alcohol prices and blame it on Nicola Sturgeon.”Officials reported the retailers were already describing some changes in purchasing habits: “For example, some customers who were previously known to buy large-volume, high-strength ciders, and were thought to no longer be able to afford them under the price increase of MUP, were now, reportedly, buying bottles of wine.”Elinor Dickie, a public health intelligence adviser at NHS Health Scotland and author of the report, said that this first study on implementation represented a crucial foundation for the policy’s evaluation.“Minimum unit pricing has the potential to improve Scotland’s relationship with alcohol and reduce the harm it causes. But MUP in the form we have it in Scotland hasn’t been put it in place anywhere before. That’s why it’s so important to gather evidence of its impact through a robust and comprehensive evaluation.”Similar legislation is to come into force next year in Wales. Ministers Northern Ireland were considering minimum pricing before the Stormont power-sharing government collapsed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba9e35ef184b3b7d5a646b8df3f6449789912baf/243_1267_2271_1362/master/2271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0351a0bfc54634c8419590e8f33312e3","title":"ashes fun charity shield teasing and skateboarding tweens","story":"Also featuring a knockout from the bottom, a magical throw and a slightly damp pitch1) No one’s said too much about it, but the Ashes are back with us.

He’ll be calling for his head at some stage this month, make no mistake. The captain is off the mark with a nice shot, pushing Woakes down the ground with a minimum of fuss, coming back for three. With Anderson out of the attack, they need to get through the rest of this spell and back into Stokes and Moeen.36th over: Australia 105-5 (Smith 35, Paine 0) 222 from eight overs after lunch before this over and it’s ever so close to a third with Broad beating Smith with a delivery that straightens beautifully. A rare bumper follows, Smith getting in behind the rest. This is proper. BRILLIANT review, Woakes talking Root into it, the captain backing his bowler. Pitching middle, shaping back, hitting in line with off-stump... striking off-stump. Edgbaston goes WILD once again. ANOTHER REVIEW! Has Woakes trapped Wade? He thinks so, challenging the not out decision of Joel Wilson. Here we go again!34th over: Australia 103-4 (Smith 34, Wade 0) Just when England needed to hold their nerve they have created chances in consecutive overs and Australia have to start again. NOT OUT! Over the top! Just! “You’re going to cry in a minute!” roars the Hollies Stand but the technology supports the decision of the former captain to review. “Talk about knowing where your off-stump is,” says Kumar Sangakkara on telly. Too right. DRAMA! HAS BROAD GOT SMITH LBW SHOULDERING ARMS? Aleem Dar has given it. Smith has sent it upstairs too! Here we go. Stand by.33rd over: Australia 99-4 (Smith 29, Wade 0) So nearly two in three balls! Wade, the man who has forced his way into this side, edges his second ball to third slip on the bounce. It’s another super Woaes delivery, the Tasmanian saved by soft hands at the point of contact.He sure has! Nothing wrong with that, coming back just a tad off the seam and catching the South Australian on the crease. Pitching and hitting in line, middle and off stump is the destination of the ball. A big breakthrough from the local lad, just when times looked tough.HAS WOAKES TRAPPED HEAD? Joel Wilson says so! But Head is sending it upstairs, making the DRS sign with one second remaining. This is a big moment. Stand by! 32nd over: Australia 98-3 (Smith 29, Head 35) England are trying to get the ball changed, Broad suggesting to Aleem Dar it is out of shape. But he’s having none of that. The chat comes after Broad floats onto Smith’s pads, the main man taking a couple. The key point: this ball has stopped swinging around. “These field placings are suggesting to me,” says David Lloyd, “that England think this is a flat pitch.” Patience is everything, then. Who has more of it?31st over: Australia 95-3 (Smith 26, Head 35) Very similar to Woakes’ previous set, giving both set men a chance to rotate the strike with balls on the line of their body. England have to keep their cool here.“The idea of “getting funky” with the batting order recalls for me one classic example from one day cricket—a Benson and Hedges Cup match at Hobart in 1990,” says Edmund King. “Australia decided to reverse their batting order facing a seemingly substandard target from New Zealand. Let’s just say it did not go according to plan, producing this priceless final over from Chris Pringle with Australia needing 1 run to win (Kiwi cricketing folklore how was that first ball not a wide?, etc. etc.): Good times.” This is my kinda content. And how do I not remember it? 30th over: Australia 92-3 (Smith 25, Head 33) Broad beats Head outside the off stump and the crowd wake up to make some noise for the first time since the break, encouraged by Root at slip to make some noise ala Virat Kohli. But it his Head who reponds best, stroking Broad beautifully back past his boots for four. We also have the Women’s British Open blog running today.29th over: Australia 87-3 (Smith 24, Head 29) Head is defending well and calling loudly, well replaced to clip a couple away when Woakes angles into his pads. He’s now faced 50 deliveries. A big day for him.28th over: Australia 85-3 (Smith 24, Head 27) A steady re-start for Broad, both batsmen collecting easy singles to long leg moving their partnership to 50. England, of course, have Stokes to help out and bowl plenty of overs with Anderson injured. But still, tough yards.The players are back on the field! I’m going to commit to pulling the rest of these countries together when Rob takes over at the drinks break. For now, I’m back into the saddle with Stuart Broad, who is bowling to Steve Smith.

Welcome!And it’s not good. From the England camp at lunch. “Jimmy Anderson has tightness to his right calf and will have a scan this afternoon. A further update will be given later today. He felt tightness at the end of his fourth over.”Difficult to know whether that means he will be able to field in the middle session he was out there before lunch. That certainly feels like he’s cooked for the day, doesn’t it? Let me be the 100th person in the lunch room to say... Glenn McGrath, 2005, this very ground. Speaking of 2005, the Ashes-winning squad from that year are doing a lap of honour. 27th over: Australia 83-3 (Smith 23, Head 26) Moeen to Head for the final over of this eventful session. He plays it out without concern. A maiden it is as they leave the field for lunch. Still England’s morning after three early wickets but an excellent little fightback from these two, putting on 48 in 76 balls through the second hour. Broad was brilliant early on, pinning Warner (albeit from a delivery missing leg stump) then finding Bancroft’s edge. Woakes did his bit too, sending down a beauty to Khawaja who looked the part until that point. Smith and Head both took their time before settling then scoring freely in the lead up to the break. They look good.Perhaps most conerning for England is that we haven’t seen Anderson at the bowling crease since his fourth over. It was a lovely, if brief, spell but ended prematurely when leaving the field. He was back after a few overs but didn’t come back on. There are reports of blood seen on the veteran’s hand - I’ll keep an eye on that. Righto, I need a break for a bit. I suggest you do the same. I’ll be back in about 20 minutes to plough through my very busy inbox. Thanks for your company through the first session. Back shortly. 26th over: Australia 83-3 (Smith 23, Head 26) It is Woakes to replace Stokes, in which will probably be the penultimate over of the session provided he can get it bowled inside four minutes. He’s straighter to Smith than Stokes, playing with a straight bat in response. A bit shorter, with the pentultimate ball, he nearly squares him up but the No4 successfully deflects from high on his blade to third man with soft hands. A bouncer to finish - we haven’t seen many of those. 25th over: Australia 81-3 (Smith 21, Head 26) Smith is solid and patient in defence, seeing off Moeen. Overpitching to finish, he strokes nicely through the gap at cover for three. Into the 20s from 51 deliveries. I can’t remember Smith’s exact average when reaching 50 balls in Test cricket but, if I recall correctly, it is 100-plus. 24th over: Australia 78-3 (Smith 18, Head 26) Five more runs off Stokes, who has been patchy in this spell. Smith plays a pull that we were so familiar with from his first stint in the Test team, holding his pose after completing the shot. After picking up another single in that direction, Head flicks another misdirected delivery for two. Broad or Woakes for a quick one before lunch at this end? “Why’s Jonny Bairstow behind the stumps for the tests rather than Jos Buttler?” asks Theo. “I know YJB wants the gloves, but is there no consensus on who is the better wicketkeeper?”A great curiosity of mine the extent to which YJB’s insistence has made it so. I’d have Foakes there to allow him to just bat. Not to be. 23rd over: Australia 73-3 (Smith 15, Head 24) Smith won’t be doing anything before lunch to risk his wicket against Moeen, getting on the front foot time and again to play him cautiously to fielders in front of the wicket. When the spinner drops his length back, the former captain responds by going deep to to clip one. Clever batting. An idea I’ve been pushing around on the podcast lately. Thoughts?22nd over: Australia 72-3 (Smith 14, Head 24) Another busy over, seven more added - Smith glancing Stokes then Head doing the same, albeit off his backside, for another batch of four leg byes. If it ends up being another low-scoring scrap, this counterattacking period won’t be for nothing. Smith will have a good handle on that. A massive response to the country call out. I might have knocked off a quarter of the globe in the space of one stint. We’ll see at lunch. 21st over: Australia 65-3 (Smith 11, Head 24) Moeen Ali gets a chance with about 22 minutes remaining until they can grab a bite. He was so important in Australia’s first innings of the 2015 Ashes in Cardiff, ripping through the middle order that day. Head wants a piece of him early though, leaning back in the crease to punch through cover for another boundary - shot - then making it two in a row off the edge. Nothing convincing about that second stroke but the board keeps ticking. Isa Guha notes a bit of variable bounce. Hmm.20th over: Australia 57-3 (Smith 11, Head 16) Right, ignore what I said about Head having a good old look. Not so much here against Stokes, pulling him through midwicket for four then steering him through point for another. There is plenty of movement from the latter offering away from the bat but he watched it all the way onto his blade. He gets three more to finish, behind point off the edge but without risk because he has made contact with soft hands. And just like that, he has overtaken Steve Smith. 19th over: Australia 46-3 (Smith 11, Head 5) Head is off the mark after a solid half an hour at the crease, driving a couple off Woakes to mid-off then clipping three through midwicket from the delivery that follows. Once again missing his line, Smith’s pad deflects the final ball down to the fine leg rope for leg byes. Ian Botham is getting stuck into the Australian fans, saying they have one song: “Go Aussie Go.” Um, no. That’s not it. For your viewing pleasure at lunch. 18th over: Australia 37-3 (Smith 11, Head 0) Stokes to Smith is a tasty contest, the former beating the bat with the first of his fresh over as the clouds completely shut out the sun here at Edgbaston. It’s a much better set from the all-rounder, Smith leaving by default.“This is great,” writes Yvonne Beddow. “Every time I come back to the OBO tab and refresh the page, England have taken a wicket!”And from Stuart MacKenzie. “Ok, not cricket but rugby. I persuaded my wife to agree to Jupiter from the Planets (which she didn’t know) as our song for exiting the church after our wedding. Unfortunately my rugby pals told her later that it’s also the tune for the ‘World In Union’ song that gets trotted out for every Rugby World Cup, and so she thinks I chose it deliberately to sneak rugby (of which she’s not a fan) into the service. I genuinely didn’t think about this in advance (I like Jupiter but not World in Union) but she doesn’t believe me, and has never forgiven me for not telling her!”I had a plan to name a child Dermott, on the basis that my girlfriend is English, but she now knows me (and his stories) too well. No way.17th over: Australia 37-3 (Smith 11, Head 0) I’m going to compile the list of nations at the lunch break, as I’ve created a (lovely) monster with the aim of ticking off every UN nation. Every email is appreciated, trust me, but I best get back to the cricket. Woakes to Smith and the former captain is again off strike early in the over with one, this time to square leg. Head has started well, showing no signs of aggressive against balls that are designed to tempt him outside his off-stump. As James Vince knows, it is a blessing and a curse when you are known for punishing bowlers through extra cover.16th over: Australia 36-3 (Smith 10, Head 0) Smith gets off strike from the first ball of Stokes’ new over, past mid-off. Head is leaving and evading but the all-rounder’s radar is off, so he can watch a few balls in a row drift down the legside to finish. Stay away from those.15th over: Australia 35-3 (Smith 9, Head 0) England will know that Head was far from convincing combating during their last home summer, the South Australian routinely messed up by Bumrah and co. Woakes is asking the right questions, Head making contact a couple of times and leaving very close to his off-stump. Nothing wrong with that. A wicket maiden for Birmingham’s favourite son. “No wedding day misshaps but this was the music we walked out of the long room at Trent Bridge too last year after we got married,” tweets @Berdo7. Speaking of twitter, @stalin_great (??) says he is in “the Soviet Socialist Republic of Bali, where Mrs Stalina has just understood the real reason why I have cried off from taking her out to eat tonight - OBO! Has any Leader of the Masses made a greater sacrifice for cricket?” More conventionally: @Markzip is in South West Ireland, Stephen Cooke in Spain, John Allen South Korea and @ehjchess is waiting his turn at the dentist. And Ibiza for @jw1789 - with wine.A tiny outside edge! Given not out on the field but there was no way that England weren’t reviewing that. Technology quickly confirms the feather. There was just enough movement from a full length perfect bowling in these conditions with the still new-ish ball. 14th over: Australia 35-2 (Khawaja 13, Smith 9) Stokes is into the attack and gives Khawaja something gentle on the pads, which he clips away with ease for four. Happy batting. A quicker ball follows, beating his blade and thumpsinginto his pad, but it has pitched outside leg so there is nothing to worry about. Going well, he is. “Morning Collo, great to have you on the tools.” Nick Toovey! The loosest man on all the internet. “Now that that first hour’s nerves have settled, are you also noticing that ball isn’t carrying through very well? Could just be me (and I’m sneaking in a few balls here and there after an office move has situated the MD right behind my desk – the same MD who has begged me to do some work over the course of the next 6 weeks), but the catch to slip dropped low, the keeper and slips aren’t standing that far back, and balls are being taken at knee height. Could be a fourth-innings sponge?” Sound. Broad was hitting 90mph or near enough but wasn’t exactly pinging them through at shoulder height. That will suit Khawaja. “Jack Jarvis here – long time reader, first time emailer.” Jack, I love a first-time-caller. Good on you. “I’m quite nervous, I hope this story is good enough to make the grade on the first day of the actual Ashes.” Don’t be. This is a nice place - especially when England are doing well in a Test Match. Okay, to your tale. “A bloke in my office got married and left it to his soon-to-be-brother-in-law to press play on the ipod to start the music for his soon-to-be-wife to walk down the aisle. He panicked and just pressed “play” without selecting anything and it played the first thing in the list – Dreadlock Holiday by 10CC. Does anyone else have any similar cricket themed song based wedding mishaps?”Niche request! I like it. But if you’re going to find anyone in this very specific boat, I suspect they will be reading on here. 13th over: Australia 30-2 (Khawaja 8, Smith 9) After nearly beating cover with a nice drive, Khawaja goes down the ground off Woakes for three along the carpet. Nice shot. He’s looked very tidy so far. Smith defends the rest, getting Australia to the end of the first hour.“I’m sure you’re aware that TMS managed (by one means or another) to get a listener in every (UN) country in the world over the course ofthe World Cup,” says Graeme Thorn. “I wonder if you (that is, the ) are planning onattempting something similar for the Ashes OBO this year?”Well, what a fine idea! We have some help already. To Felix Schäfer in Germany, who has found the sport in his 30s, thank you for joining the fam. Phil Sawyer in Malaysia from a club lounge, great to see you as always. Simon Thomas ticks the Croatian box “from a yacht in the Adriatic, being shouted at by the skipper for not listening to his instructions and getting sun burned to a crisp.” Milo Dodd in Stuttgart. Jonathan Harding is Big in Japan. Ciaron Murphy is in Manly at dinner with his wife hiding his phone. DRINKS! 12th over: Australia 27-2 (Khawaja 5, Smith 9) After causing Smith so much trouble in his previous over, Broad gives him another full ball to deal with, this time timing it behind point for four. That’ll help build the confidence. As will the fact that Broad must be nearly done for now. Perhaps Anderson will follow him from this end? 11th over: Australia 23-2 (Khawaja 5, Smith 5) That’s Smith at his most confident, getting across his stumps to whip Woakes through midwicket - off the mark with the stroke, racing down to the rope. He grabs another single around the corner to keep the strike, again after shuffling across his woodwork. You do you, Steve. You do you. “Moved to New Zealand six years ago from the UK but currently on a tiny island off the coast of mainland Fiji with very dicey mobile reception so unfortunately no TMS for me but as ever enjoying the OBO and one of my brothers what’s apping the important bits to me in real time,” reports Ian Rinn. “Will be with you for another hour or so before sleep but keep up the great work and look forward to reading the full OBO over breakfast. Same to my brother Chris and it seems the England bowling attack!”Emails in from all over the world this morning, the OBO bringing us all together. Thanks for your company. To Adrian Goldman, too, in Kuopio in Finland and Andrew Denton (not the Australian one, he tells me) who is stuck on a tarmac in Rome. As the over ends, Jimmy Anderson returns to the field from beneath me in the pavilion. 10th over: Australia 17-2 (Khawaja 4, Smith 0) Broad is up again! There’s a sound when the ball passes Smith but it is off the pad - they don’t go upstairs. A near carbon-copy of the first ball later on, again clipping Smith on the pad flap before ending up with Bairstow. The TV tells us that Broad has never bowled fuller in a spell than he has so far this morning, according to CricViz. He finishes by beating Smith with a beauty. Of course, he’s been at the bowling crease for the defining spell of the last three Ashes series in this county."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22f12ab2da3d8e6cdb03bb10a8b417a84a257770/0_139_3361_2017/master/3361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9c22b3641de1e24a7a29adfc68b3b4c","title":"golf womens british open 2019 first round live","story":"Watch out, field! Ko Jin-young is on the move. She curls in a huge left-to-right breaker on 7, and the smooth-swinging ANA and Evian champion is already -3. When you’re hot, you’re hot. Meanwhile may I offer many apologies to the exciting Maria Fassi, who fails to get up and down from a swale to the side of the par-three 8th, and drops to +1. I’ll keep quiet next time. Bah. Such a thin line between -2 and +1. The majesty of golf, right there.Maria Fassi came second at the inaugural Augusta Women’s Amateur event this year. She was four shots shy of winner Jennifer Kupcho, but four clear of the rest of the field. The pair were sensational that week in Georgia, and both are now beginning to make their mark on the professional game. Kupcho came second at the Evian last week, and now it’s Fassi’s turn to shine. The 21-year-old Mexican is so unlucky at the par-five 7th. Having been one of the few competitors so far to go for the green in two, she finds herself shortsided behind a bunker, but flops majestically high over the sand and down towards the cup. If there was no flagstick, it was slam-dunking in for eagle. But it hits the pin and twangs out to six feet. So unfortunate, and you know how these things so often go. The birdie putt’s missed, the ball lipping out when it was surely due to drop. She remains at level par.Ashleigh Buhai’s tee shot at 18 leaks a little bit to the right. But from the semi-rough she sends her second to the fringe at the back of the green. She very nearly drains a 35-footer for her eighth birdie of the day, but what looked a great putt goes whistling five feet past. But she nails the one coming back, and that’s a 65 that gives her the new clubhouse lead. According to Laura Davies, who is in the Sky commentary box (yes!), she’s a “solid and steady” performer whose early career was blighted by injury. But now she’s finally delivering on her teenage promise. A sensational round of golf by the 30-year-old from Johannesburg.When a bounce goes your way, you’ve got to take advantage of the break. And on 7, Georgia Hall does exactly that, sending her third to 15 feet and making the birdie putt. She’s -2. Birdie too for her partner Brooke Henderson, who returns to -1. And both of them are now on the dancefloor at the par-three 8th.Back-to-back birdies for the new world number one! Ko Jin-young comes off the back of picking up a shot at 5 by caressing an iron to six feet at the par-three 6th. The ANA and Evian champ is -2. She’s going round with Nelly Korda, who finished in a tie for third at the PGA a couple of months ago. She birdies 6 as well, following the stroke she’d picked up at 2. And to tie up a loose end from earlier: PGA champion Hannah Green finished with a highly average 73.A huge break for the reigning champ on the par-five 7th. Hall flays her drive into trees down the right, and smacks into one of the big trunks. But a lucky bounce sends her ball into a clearing in the thicket, and she’s able to whip a wedge over some smaller trees and back onto the fairway. That should keep her going. It’s not been a great year for Hall, though: just the one top-ten finish in 15 starts, her best showing in the majors a tie for 26th at the PGA. A couple of wild tee shots today that confirm she’s not quite at the top of her form. But if she can get round today with a score - and conditions are favourable - it could light a fire for the rest of the week.We have a new leader! Ashleigh Buhai makes it three birdies in a row, the latest coming at 16. The 30-year-old South African has done absolutely nothing in the majors: a tie for 27th at the US Open two years ago, a tie for 30th at this event, also in 2017. Until now, that is. Buhai has won the South African Open three times, mind you. Throw in wins on the European Tour at the Catalonia Masters in 2007 and the Portugal Open in 2011 she’s a big star back home. But this is an announcement on the world stage. Par on 17 keeps it going.Hall’s tee shot at the par-three 6th is straight at the flag. About 12 feet short. One that looks just fine to the lay-hacker, but the defending champ looks disgusted with herself. The birdie putt stays high on the left, a slight misread. But it’s a par that keeps her at -1. Her partner Brooke Henderson sends her tee shot long, then fluffs a chip from the thick stuff she’s sent her ball into. She can’t scramble par from the fringe, and that slips the Canadian back to level par.The US Open champion Jeongeun Lee6 missed the cut last week at the Evian. It looks as though the extra rest over the weekend has done her some good. Birdies at 2 and 4, and she’s -2. And Ashleigh Buhai has certainly recovered her poise: another birdie, this time at 15, and she joins the clubhouse leaders Hinako Shibuno and Danielle Kang at -6!The 2016 PGA champion Brooke Henderson has started steadily. She’s -1 through the first five holes, having birdied 2. Meanwhile for the second time today, her playing partner Georgia Hall leaves a birdie putt one turn short. She’s -1 too, but it could be so much better defending champion. And a second birdie for the pre-tournament favourite Ariya Jutanugarn having picked up a shot at 2, she now rattles in a 20-footer across 6. She’s -2.Caroline Masson is in with a 69. Pars all the way back home, and the 30-year-old German, who finished in a tie for third in this event a couple of years ago, looks pretty content with that. Almost as happy as these folk popping the lids on their Californian carafes.It’s a careful two-putt par for Hall. She looks a little disappointed, having left a fairly straight 25-foot birdie putt from the fringe a good three feet short. But she tidies up, and would surely have taken par when watching her tee shot sail towards the trees. Meanwhile the 22-year-old Swede Linnea Strom, a LPGA Tour rookie this season, is out in 32, having just birdied 9. She’s -4.Georgia Hall is in a little spot of bother down the left of 4, having whistled her drive into the trees. No matter! Even though her backswing is slightly impeded, she whip-cracks a low iron out under the branches, drawing the ball into the heart of the green. That’s a sublime escape, and though her ball scampers past the hole and settles on the fringe at the back, she allows herself a little grin anyway. A perfectly planned and near-on-perfectly executed shot, and it’ll have felt good. From a position of trouble, par now looks likely. Meanwhile birdie at 14 for Ashleigh Buhai, who has indeed rediscovered the forward momentum of earlier. She joins the group in second spot at -5.A real comedown for Jennifer Kupcho, whose 66 lit up the rainy final day at the Evian. The inaugural Augusta champ stumbled to a 77, four days after that coming-of-age second place. All part of the learning curve for the 22-year-old from Colorado. A miserable 77 for Mel Reid, who came so close at the PGA a couple of months ago with a final day 66. Reid came into this week as a dark horse, her big-hitting style perfect for Woburn. But she’s got work to do now to avoid the cut. Meanwhile Moriya Jutanugarn pars the last and signs for a 67. The top of the leaderboard looks locked down for a while, until some of the later starters make a run anyway. Or perhaps Ashleigh Buhai will get going again.Par for Danielle Kang up the last, and she joins Hinako Shibuno in the clubhouse lead. A 66, and she’s -6. A disappointing day for seven-time major winner Inbee Park, who never quite got going in the last round at the Evian, and has shot 75 today. Shanshan Feng had performed much better at the business end of the Evian, but it’s a 75 for her as well. They’re both +3. That’s Feng’s first card over 69 in her last nine rounds. The run had to end sometime.The defending champ Georgia Hall makes up for that oh-so-close birdie effort on 1, with a garden-variety birdie at the accommodating par-five 2nd. That’ll settle the nerves that are bound to be jangling away right now. Meanwhile a closing bogey for Lexi Thompson, who walks off the green with her shoulders slumped. A one-under 71.The 2017 British Open provided one of golf’s great feelgood moments, as IK Kim finally broke her major duck at Kingsbarns. Few begrudged her victory, as it was Kim who suffered perhaps golf’s most infamous yip, missing from 12 inches when the 2012 ANA Inspiration was hers for the taking. The ANA caused her some more grief this year when, in contention on the final day, she sent a drive into trees, the ball snagging and refusing to drop back down. A double-bogey seven, a right old karmic outrage. She ended tied for fourth. Anyway, she’s looking good for some better fortune this week, opening with a 69. She’s -3.Georgia Hall begins her title defence with a bir ... argh. She was this close. A perfect opening drive, a second shot to 15 feet, then a putt that looked to be dropping before it died to the left on the final turn. A couple of blades of grass away from the dream start. Meanwhile up on 17, Danielle Kang’s hot streak continues with yet another birdie, as she swishes her tee shot at 17 to six feet and joins Hinako Shibuno at the top. Birdie for Moriya Jutanugarn, thanks to a trundle from 30 feet across 16. And a dropped shot for Ashleigh Buhai, at 11, the first blemish on her card today.Back-to-back birdies for Danielle Kang. She follows her kick-in birdie at 15 by teasing the gallery with a right-to-left 20-foot curler on 16. Her ball threatens to stop one dimple short of the cup, but topples in eventually. She’s just a shot off the lead. As is Ashleigh Buhai, the 30-year-old from Johannesburg who has done very little in the majors to date: her best performance is a tie for 30th in this event two years ago. But she’s birdied 2, 3, 6, 7 and now 10. And then there’s Charley Hull, who nails a 20-footer on the last and signs for an excellent opening-day 67!What a major debut for Hinako Shibuno! The young Japanese sensation - I think we’re already allowed to call her that - sends her second at 18 to 12 feet, then curls in a right-to-left putt for her seventh birdie in 11 holes! She comes back in 30 strokes, signs for a 66, and now at -6 leads the British Open after her first round in major-championship golf. Wow. You’ll not see a broader grin all week ... unless she goes on to win this, of course. And don’t put it past the 20-year-old, either. One of the two titles she’s already secured at home is the Salonpas Cup, one of the four major titles in the LPGA of Japan Tour. So she’s already racked up some valuable experience when the pressure is on.Danielle Kang is about to move to -4. The 26-year-old from San Francisco sends a wedge over the flag at the par-five 15th to 12 inches. The 2017 PGA champion has enjoyed a curious year in the majors: a couple of top-six finishes, plus two missed cuts, in a pleasing alternate pattern. If that continues, she’ll be challenging come the business end of this tournament. Meanwhile it’s back-to-back birdies for Lexi Thompson, at 15 and 16. The putter seems to work a lot better from distance, it’s the tiddlers that mess with her mind. She’s -2, and allows herself a smile for the first time in a difficult week for her.Hinako Shibuno grabs a share of the lead on her major championship debut! The 20-year-old Japanese prodigy has been talked up by those in the know back at home, having already won twice this year on her home tour. She’s been ripping it up since the turn: birdies at 10, 11, 12 and 15, and now a wonderful iron smoothly sent towards the flag at the par-three 17th. It stops three feet short, and in goes the birdie putt that takes her to the top of the tree. How’s that for your first ever round in a major?!Ariya Jutanugarn is the joint favourite to win this week, along with the reigning ANA and Evian champion Ko Jin-young. She’s already won the British Open here at Woburn, back in 2016. She’s not out yet, but her older sister Moriya is keeping up appearances for the family. Back-to-back birdies at 13 and 14, to follow front-nine birdies at 2 and 4, whizz her up the standings to -4. Both the Jutanugarns are in hot form, Ariya finishing fifth at the Evian last week, Moriya a shot behind in sixth. What a story it would be if Thailand’s second major champion came from the same family, in the same championship, on the same course. Only in sport, huh.Park Sung-hyun is in with a 67. She’d sent her approach to 18 pin high, ten feet from the flag, but her putter slipped back into Evian Mode and she had to settle for par. But that’s a magnificent response to that hugely disappointing 75 on Sunday at the Evian, when she couldn’t find a fairway or make a putt. A blistering return to form, to borrow a phrase from will-this-do music journalism.Laura Davies is playing in her 39th consecutive British Open. There was a dream start for the Dame this morning, as she birdied 2. But since then it’s been a miserable day for the four-time major-winning veteran. Seven bogeys and two doubles, and she walks off the 18th in a grim mood, having shot 82. Davies won the British in 1986, but never after it was upgraded to a major, her best performance coming at Sunningdale back in 2004, when compatriot Karen Stupples took the prize while Davies tied for eighth. She’s +10, and most likely will be missing the cut. I do hope she’s in the commentary box over the weekend. She was magnificent at the Open a couple of weeks ago, explaining the shots on option in an easy-going and informative manner, wearing her expertise lightly. Also at one point she took a righteous sideswipe at the advent of VAR in football, calling it out as the pointless fiasco it most certainly is. Preach on, sister.But what of Border Control’s Lexi Thompson? She’s level par through 14, having just missed a par putt from two feet. Thompson is sensational from tee to green, but misses so many short putts. A new grip this week, but it’s making little difference. She should have more than just the one major to her name, but the 2014 ANA Inspiration is all she’s got.Park fails to hit her birdie putt on 16, the ball dying to the left. A great chance to pull two clear at the top spurned. She stays at -5. Meanwhile Hinako Shibuno, who has already won twice on the Japanese tour this season, birdies 15 to join Charley Hull in second place at -4. And Jennifer Kupcho, the brilliant young American who won this years inaugural Augusta Women’s Amateur, and having since turned pro came second in last week’s Evian, drains a monster across 13 for birdie. That must have been the best part of 80 feet! Sadly she’s been struggling today, perhaps understandably so after such a huge effort on Sunday in shooting 66. And the birdie only takes her back to +3. But Kupcho has game. She’s a really exciting player to watch.Park Sung-hyun steps on the gas again. She rolls in a straight 30-foot birdie putt on the par-five 15th, then sends her second at the 16th pin high to eight feet. She’s -5, and will have that to take a two-shot lead. It’s been a relatively disappointing year in the majors for Park, the 2017 US Open and 2018 PGA winner. She nearly snatched the PGA from under the nose of Hannah Green, and was in the mix at the Evian before fading very badly indeed in the final round, driving and putting extremely erratically. But it would seem she’s shrugged off that disappointment quicksmart.Hull is out in a superstar threeball this morning. She’s playing alongside the reigning PGA champion Hannah Green, who secured her first major at Hazeltine in June by holding off a charge from Park Sung-hyun, and Shanshan Feng, the 2012 PGA winner. Feng came into this tournament in hot form, having finished in a tie for second last week at the Evian, and won the Thornberry Creek Classic in her previous outing. Her last eight rounds of tournament golf: 64, 67, 65, 63, 69, 66, 68, 68. That run could come to an end today, sadly. She’s +2, having just pulled a par tiddler left at the par-three 14th. Green also three putts the hole to bogey. It’s her first bogey of the day ... but she’s had two doubles as well. And five birdies! So she’s level par. The dictionary definition of a rollercoaster ride, right there.And it’s already bubbling up nicely at Woburn! Park Sung-hyun, deposed last Sunday as world number one by ANA Inspiration and Evian champion Ko Jin-young, has responded in the fashion you’d expect. Out in 32 this morning, she also birdied 10 to take the early lead at -5. But she’s since dropped a stroke at 11. And now she’s been joined at the top by Charley Hull, who had been long tipped as the woman most likely to end England’s wait for a major, since Karen Stupples won this tournament in 2004, only for Georgia Hall to beat her to it last year. Out in a relatively quiet 35, the 23-year-old from Kettering has exploded since the turn, with birdies at 10, 11 and 12.Welcome to the ’s live hole-by-hole coverage of the 2019 Women’s British Open from Woburn. It’s the fifth and last major of the year, coming a whopping four days after the dramatic conclusion of the fourth, the Evian Championship in France. Georgia Hall, on her home course, will defend a title won last year in swashbuckling fashion, pipping Pornanong Phatlum in a head-to-head battle with some heat-seeking approaches over the closing stretch at Lytham.There’s been plenty of early action already. So with Open fever rising, let’s not hang around. Emergency! Someone, please, call Dr Golf!

I’m now moving house and setting up a home office. I want to dispense with my laptop – the source of my problems – and buy a desktop and an ergonomic keyboard.I’m confused about whether to get an all-in-one or a PC with a separate monitor. I am only really going to use it for internet and typing articles. I realise that this means I can look to the cheaper end of the market, but is there much slowdown in speed at that end? Should I be spending the money to get a good processor? PollyLaptops can be considered harmful if used for prolonged serious work rather than casual use. If you have neck and shoulder problems, you should seek medical help. I’ve been saved twice by an excellent physiotherapist, at my own expense. I’ve also spent time and money mitigating problems, but there is no panacea. Buying an ergonomic keyboard is only one part of a solution that could also include the mouse, desk, chair, lighting, work habits and, perhaps, glasses.You don’t need a computer to get a repetitive strain injury (RSI). Housemaid’s knee, tennis elbow, writer’s cramp, potter’s wrist and other afflictions are much older than iPad neck, but they all have similar causes. According to the UK’s Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the risk factors include repetitive work, the use of sustained or excessive force, awkward and static working postures, and doing the same thing for long periods without taking rest breaks. Without job rotation, that last one may be the hardest to solve, though software can help.Unfortunately, people tend to feel invulnerable until they get an RSI. Just as losing a hard drive tends to persuade people that backups are a good idea, carpal tunnel syndrome is a great spur to taking ergonomics seriously. It’s better to do something before you reach that stage.Start with a sheet of paper, a tape measure, and a friend. Drawing a stick-figure diagram with your measurements will help you find products that will work well for someone of your height.To get the correct posture, your feet should be flat on the floor, and when sitting upright, your eyes should be roughly level with the top of the screen. Your friend can then measure the distance between your eyes and the floor. Everything else has to fit in between.Your thighs should be at right angles to the floor or pointing very slightly downwards, which will fix the height of the seat of the chair. This won’t happen by magic, which is why proper office chairs have adjustable seats.As a cross-check, extend one arm horizontally. It should almost touch the centre of the screen.When you are trying to find the most comfortable position, some tweaking is inevitable. It’s therefore better to buy products that allow for minor adjustments. You can fudge things with cushions, footrests, and books under monitors, but it’s better to do it right.Some people have switched to standing desks, and some devices provide a choice. Varidesk, for example, says that “our simple design takes you from sitting to standing in just 3 seconds, requires no assembly and works with your existing furniture”. It also has a 30-day money-back guarantee. Other options range from aiBox’s ultra-cheap cardboard version to the motorised Gazedesk, which you can set by entering your height and weight in its smartphone app.A panel of experts commissioned by Public Health England recommended standing desks in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, so I feel guilty for never have tried one.An ergonomic keyboard lets you align the keys with your hands and arms, so there is no bend in your wrists. It may take months of small adjustments to reach that stage, so flexibility helps.Technically, almost any computer system will work if you set it up correctly. I prefer tower systems, which usually last longer because they are easier to expand, upgrade and repair. They have plenty of space for cooling, so they can use hotter, faster chips with TDPs of 60W to 130W. Laptops use cooler, slower chips – typically 5W to 25W – because it’s hard to manage heat in confined spaces, and their processors are throttled when they start to overheat.All-in-ones are tidier but they don’t have the power and expandability of a proper desktop, and you don’t get a choice of monitor. Also, if either the PC or the screen fails, you may lose both. If space is a problem, I’d rather go for an SFF (small form factor) or mini-PC instead.Several people have asked about buying new desktops so I may return to this topic, though the “laptop for uni” questions are becoming more urgent.You are right in thinking that you could get away with a slower processor and a traditional hard drive: an SSD makes less difference in a desktop where the hard drive is spinning all the time. However, there are no speed limits in computing, and it’s always better to have a faster PC. You can run more browsers with many more tabs, which would bring a slow PC to its knees.I’d rather not drop below 5,000 for a desktop, and 2,500 for a laptop that gets more casual use. Slow PCs are only cheaper if your time has no value.Have you got a question?

Here are the standout episodes to try firstEvery December I contribute to the ’s end-of-year best TV list, and it’s sometimes a little bittersweet partly because a show I truly love will only make it into the mid-40s, and partly because I know my list won’t be entirely complete. Twice now, this has been because IFC’s Documentary Now! was unavailable to watch legally in the UK.Which is stupid, because Documentary Now! is a work of incredible pedigree. Created by Seth Meyers, Bill Hader and Fred Armisen – along with director Rhys Thomas – it’s a series of perfectly observed, highly specific and obsessively crafted documentary pastiches delivered in the straightest way imaginable. To watch an episode is to witness a labour of love take flight, and having to leave Documentary Now! off my list has broken my heart.But this year will be different, because Documentary Now! has just appeared on Amazon Prime. It should be the very next thing you watch.The sheer level of care that goes into every single episode is breathtaking. In an age where television still likes to patronise its viewers, the series works on an understanding of shared appreciation. There’s very little hand-holding here it expects you to have seen the documentaries it parodies. You’ll still have fun if you haven’t but, if you have, you will enjoy it like nothing else. In many ways, Documentary Now! is the perfect show for the age of Peak TV. It’s too specific for everyone to enjoy, but those who like it will love it with their entire hearts.Look, like it or not, Documentary Now! is going to be in my end-of-year list. Here are the standout episodes you should try first, so at least you’ll know what I’m talking about.The first ever Documentary Now! episode is arguably also the best possible introduction to the series. A takeoff of 1975’s Grey Gardens, about two reclusive aristocrats living in poverty in a crumbling mansion, Sandy Passage is a shade broader than most other episodes. Armisen and Hader are both playing women here, and the subject matter has to be pushed into an uncharacteristically absurd area to top the genuine batshittery of the source material. But the look of it is absolutely perfect the lengths that the directors must have gone to in order to replicate Grey Gardens pays off in spades.There is a strong case for saying that David Gelb’s aggressively reverent 2011 documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi – about an ageing chef who jumps through agonising, pointless hoops in his quest for perfection – is one of the most influential of the past 25 years. And this makes Juan Likes Rice \u0026amp Chicken my personal favourite. The action is transplanted from Tokyo to Colombia, and the subject now only serves chicken, rice, a cup of coffee and half a banana to his diners, each produced only after a million identical rituals are performed. It’s hilarious, and also much more poignant than anyone would expect. Watch it, then listen to writer Seth Meyers’ episode of the Good One podcast that explores the episode in more depth.Perhaps because its inception came from a SNL sketch about an upsettingly Tory punk, Documentary Now! tends to excel best when parodying musical documentaries. Gentle \u0026amp Soft: The Story of the Blue Jean Committee, Parts 1 \u0026amp 2, which produced the single Catalina Breeze, almost made this list. But for sheer scale of ambition, it has been beaten by Final Transmission. An incredibly authentic riff on Jonathan Demme’s Stop Making Sense, it was filmed as a live concert at the thousand-seater San Gabriel playhouse, California, and features the cast tearing through a 10-song setlist learned over a single weekend. That it works at all is amazing that it works this well is nothing short of a miracle.Writer John Mulaney is a noted Broadway fanatic, and this is borne out in his parody of Original Cast Album: Company, which captured Elaine Stritch’s arduous repeated attempts to correctly perform a Sondheim song during a gruelling all-night recording session. Stritch’s analogue here is played by Paula Pell, who mimics the sequence with a growing impatience that is excruciating to watch. Mulaney plays the Sondheim figure. Sondheim watched the episode. His notes afterwards were: “It’s fine. I don’t have any comments on it.”Between the second and third seasons of Documentary Now!, Hader had shifted focus to his HBO show Barry, which meant that his presence was filled by a number of guest stars. None worked more successfully than Waiting for the Artist, because Waiting for the Artist has Cate Blanchett. Blanchett plays a Marina Abramović-style performance artist, whose work variously involves painting her body and flinging herself at a wall, or putting a bucket on her head and running through mousetraps. And, honest to god, it might be the best performance she has ever given. She is troubled and abstract, sensual and focused, totally committed and brilliantly funny. An almost perfect half hour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb10c180d5e43cbc012fc00fff0d5eb87ff4cf81/0_20_3186_1912/master/3186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd440b0b05a4fc6ba1702e3eaf7e370d","title":"joe biden kamala harris and other 2020 candidates prepare for debate rematch","story":"Joe Biden was the central target as 10 Democratic presidential candidates took the stage for the second debate in Detroit on Wednesday, with rivals attempting to knock the former vice-president from his frontrunner status.Unlike last month’s debate in Miami, however, where Biden visibly struggled to defend his decades-old record, this time Biden was ready for the fight.Biden, 76, was flanked by a crop of younger and more erse candidates intent on casting him as a relic in their fight to be the party’s nominee to take on Donald Trump in the 2020 election.They included California senator Kamala Harris, who in the last debate skilfully attacked Biden’s past positions on ordered busing and segregation New Jersey senator Cory Booker, with whom Biden has sparred over criminal justice and other contenders who have so far failed to make a splash in the race, such as New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Colorado senator Michael Bennet, former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, and Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard.The debate opened with what appeared to be a redux of last month’s searing confrontation between Biden and Harris, this time over healthcare. As Harris sought to defend a Medicare-for-All plan she unveiled this week, which would maintain a role for private insurance and be implemented over 10 years, Biden sensed an opportunity.“Anytime someone tells you you’re going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it’s going to take 10 years,” he said.“To be very blunt, and to be very straightforward, you can’t beat President Trump with double-talk on this plan.“You’re just simply inaccurate in what you’re describing,” Harris shot back.Countering that Biden’s own healthcare plan would leave out roughly 10 million Americans, Harris added: “In 2019 in America, for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone, I think is without excuse.”But Harris, whose breakout moment in last month’s debate prompted a brief surge in the polls, was forced to weather other criticisms of her healthcare proposal.What followed was an unruly and often deeply personal debate over issues that included immigration, climate change and race relations.At nearly every turn, Biden and his past were brought squarely into focus.On immigration, it was Castro’s turn to land a punch when the topic turned whether or not illegal border crossings should be decriminalized. The issue, which has been elevated amid Trump’s policy of separating parents and children at the US-Mexico border, has ided Democrats.Biden dismissed the critique, pointing out he had never heard Castro level such criticisms of immigration policy while serving in the Obama administration.“It looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past, and one of us hasn’t,” Castro retorted.The tenor was not unlike Tuesday’s debate, which exposed the sharp iding lines between the progressive and moderate wings of the party.But whereas the previous night saw progressive stars Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren defending the Democratic Party’s leftward turn, Wednesday was dominated by a clash of personalities and tactics. At times, it devolved into allegations of cynicism and whose framing was most disingenuous.When Gillibrand resurrected a 1981 op-ed in which Biden argued against expanding a child tax credit for high-income earners – suggesting his views had undercut women in the workplace – Biden asked why she had previously praised his work on gender equality.“I don’t know what happened except you’re now running for president,” Biden said.A similarly personal back-and-forth transpired when Booker accused Biden of constantly linking himself to Obama, only to dodge scrutiny over the more controversial aspects of the former president’s tenure.“You can’t do it when it’s convenient and then dodge it when it’s not,” said Booker, who also went after Biden’s role in authoring a tough-on-crime bill in 1994 now seen as the cause of mass incarceration.“There are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses because you stood up and used that tough on crime phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine,” Booker said.Despite the onslaught, Biden largely managed to stand his ground.In many ways, the evening was a testament to the Democratic Party’s most pressing debate: whether to campaign on sweeping, progressive reforms or frame the election around the urgency of limiting Trump’s presidency to a single term.Biden has built his candidacy on the latter, telling voters the choice before America was to determine whether Trump would forever reshape the nation’s identity or simply go down as “an aberration”.But Warren, who has yet to share the debate stage with Biden, warned Democrats on Tuesday that the White House would not be reclaimed through “small ideas and spinelessness”.Trump dismissed his potential opponents on Wednesday.“The people on the stage tonight, and last, were not those that will either Make America Great Again or Keep America Great!” the president tweeted.In an impassioned plea to his colleagues, Booker warned Democrats that picking one another apart only worked to Trump’s benefit.“This pitting against progressives against moderates, saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn’t care enough – that to me is iding our party and demoralizing us in the face of the real enemy here,” he said.“The person who is enjoying this debate the most right now is Donald Trump.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ade2b09ecd4b5bb6f808d0c0f5cf76a749befcd/0_0_2644_1586/master/2644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c81dc9c97ad6caafb7d70eae83fd02c","title":"who is hamza bin laden heir who sought to revive al qaida","story":"The son of Osama bin Laden, Hamza was seen as an ‘emerging’ figure in al-Qaida before reports of his deathOsama bin Laden’s son, Hamza, is believed to be dead, according to reports out of the US. He had been seeking to stage attacks on western targets with the aim of restoring al-Qaida’s status at the vanguard of extreme jihadist groups, after many years of decline and eclipse by Islamic StateHamza Bin Laden is the son of Osama Bin Laden and Khairiah Sabar, one of the former al-Qaida leader’s three surviving wives. She lived with him in a compound in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad where he was killed in 2011.It is believed that Hamza was aged around 30, with the US State Department listing his suspected birth date as sometime in 1989, but the department also lists an alternative birth date of 1986.He is believed to have been born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where the Bin Laden family have lived for generations and where Hamza’s grandmother and uncles, Osama’s mother and brothers, live today.Hamza spent many years after the 911 attacks, masterminded by his father, in Iran, where he and dozens of other family members of the 911 plotters were guarded by senior Iranian intelligence and military officials.Hamza was married to one of the daughters of a senior al-Qaida leader, Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah. A video of Hamza’s wedding was found in the compound where Osama bin Laden was killed. His family also reported in an exclusive interview with the  in 2018, that Hamza had married the daughter of Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker in the 911 terror attacks.Hamza has appeared in al-Qaida videos since he was a teenager. During the family’s time in Iran after 911, Hamza was mentored by Abu al-Khayr al-Masri, who was deputy to al-Qaida’s current leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. In March, Saudi Arabia revoked Hamza’s citizenship after the US offered a $1m (£800,000) reward for help locating him.In their announcement of the reward, the State Department wrote that Hamza was “emerging as a leader in the al-Qaida franchise”.Hamza has made public statements urging followers to wage war on Washington, London, Paris and Tel Aviv and threatened attacks against the United States in revenge for the killing of his father by US military forces.Recently he has been seen as a deputy to al-Zawahiri.According to letters seized from Osama Bin Laden’s compound after his death, Osama was grooming Hamza to replace him as leader of al-Qaida.Osama Bin Laden’s family has said that they thought Hamza had shaken off the ways of his father and they had been disappointed to learn he was emulating him.“We thought everyone was over this,” Hassan Bin Laden, Osama’s brother, told the  last year. “Then the next thing I knew, Hamza was saying, ‘I am going to avenge my father.’ I don’t want to go through that again. If Hamza was in front of me now, I would tell him, ‘God guide you. Think twice about what you are doing. Don’t retake the steps of your father. You are entering horrible parts of your soul.’”The death has been reported by several news outlets, citing multiple unnamed official sources. NBC News reported the US had received intelligence that he had died, citing three American officials. The New York Times, quoting two unnamed officials, also reported Hamza bin Laden had been killed some time over the past two years, and it had taken time to confirm the death.The report said the US had a hand in the death of the al-Qaida heir.Donald Trump was asked by reporters on Wednesday if the US had intelligence that Hamza bin Laden was dead, to which the US president replied: “I don’t want to comment on that.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973463.1564597398!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools and religion non believers treated like second class citizens","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHelen O’Shea: ‘It shouldn’t be so hard to uphold a child’s constitutional right to drop out of religion.’ Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Helen O’Shea’s daughter is used to doing her homework at the back of the classroom during religious education.As an atheist parent, she says it is the price pupils pay in an education system which is still dominated by religion.“There’s an assumption that everyone is okay with religious instruction or a priest coming into the classroom . . . and if you’re not, you’re relegated to the back of the class and treated like a second-class citizen.”So she was encouraged when the Department of Education published a circular last year which instructed State-run secondary schools to offer alternative subject choices to students who did not wish to study religion.In the mostly conservative world of education, this was a game-changer.It stated that the past practice of assuming that pupils were predominantly Catholic and arranging religious instruction accordingly was no longer appropriate.Instead, parents would have to be polled on whether they wanted their children to study religion or, significantly, a different, timetabled subject.The circular applied only to State-run schools, which account for about half of secondary schools.These are run by local Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and community schools, which are run jointly by ETBs and the Catholic Church.Voluntary secondary schools, typically run or owned by religious organisations, were not affected by the circular.“I was delighted,” says O’Shea, whose daughter attends a community school in Ardee, Co Louth.“I never baptised my daughters and went out of my way to send them to an Educate Together primary school . . . But religion has a way of encroaching into your life, especially in the education system.”Fierce oppositionThe department’s move, however, was fiercely opposed by groups such as the Catholic Church, Education and Training Boards and the Teachers’ Union of Ireland.Documents obtained by The  last year show Catholic bishops warned the department that students who would receive tuition in an exam subject instead of religion would receive an unfair advantage.(Instead, they proposed that such students who opted out of religion should be offered a course in “religious heritage and values as well as ethics”).Education and Training Boards complained of having to offer an alternative subject without being given additional resources to do so.Religion teachers were also highly critical and insisted the circular was leading to widespread confusion by not clarifying the difference between “religious instruction” and “religious education”.While it said “religious instruction” related to the teaching of a particular religion for pupils of that faith, “religious education” was a much wider subject open to all pupils, regardless of their belief.Watered downIn October last year, in the face of this opposition, the department issued a “clarification” of its circular which watered down much of the meaning of the original.In a significant reversal, it said the State-approved curriculum on religious education did not contain any element of “religious instruction, formation, indoctrination or worship”.As a result, opting out of the subject and being timetabled for an alternative subject “does not arise”.However, the revised circular still included some significant changes.It said students who opted out of religious instruction (such as worship or faith-specific teaching) should be timetabled for alternative subjects, rather than doing homework at the back of class.It also said schools should proactively establish the wishes of parents in relation to opting out of religious worship or instruction.This should be integrated with the school’s processes for establishing subject choices generally.New documents, however, show most State schools are ignoring this revised circular.ETB schools, for example, have been recently directed by their umbrella body to “maintain the status quo in relation to the provision of religious education and opting-out arrangements”.The evidence on the ground in many community schools, similarly, is that the latest circular is not being implemented.ObstaclesSources in these schools argue that the lack of funding to provide for additional teaching for non-religious students is a key obstacle.However, schools are required to follow procedures set down in department circular letters.In a statement, a Department of Education spokesman confirmed that the circular applied to all “community and ETB post-primary schools”.Meanwhile, parents such as Helen O’Shea remain as frustrated as ever over what she sees as the violation of non-religious students’ rights and those of their parents.“Schools shouldn’t be allowed to cherry-pick what suits them when it comes to religion . . . It shouldn’t be so hard to uphold a child’s constitutional right to drop out of religion.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973477.1564598256!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools refusing tuition for students who opt out of religion","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAtheist Ireland said the failure of State schools to implement these measures means non-religious students are being discriminated against. File photograph: GettyState secondary schools are refusing to implement a directive which requires them to provide students who opt out of religious instruction with access to another subject.Last year, the Department of Education issued a circular requiring State schools to timetable alternative tuition throughout the school year for students who opt out of religious instruction.This was aimed at ending the practice of assuming that pupils are predominately Catholic and requiring non-religious or minority faith students to do homework during religious instruction.The circular applies to State-run schools, such as community schools or those run by Education and Training Boards (ETBs), which account for about half of secondary schools or 160,000 pupils.Voluntary secondary schools, typically run or owned by religious organisations, are not affected by the circular.However, new documents show most State schools are not implementing the circular on the basis that they do no have resources to provide alternative tuition.ETB schools, for example, were recently directed by their umbrella body to “maintain the status-quo in relation to the provision of religious education and opting-out arrangements”. A spokesman for the department has confirmed that the circular, issued in October last year, remains in place and schools are required to follow it.The campaign group Atheist Ireland said the failure of State schools to implement these measures means non-religious students are being discriminated against.“The practical application of maintaining the status quo means students who exercise their constitutional and human right not to attend religious teaching cannot access another optional subject,” said Jane Donnelly of Atheist Ireland.Nessa White, general secretary of Education and Training Boards Ireland, confirmed that the umbrella body’s advice to schools has been to maintain the “status quo” in relation to allowing students to opt out of religious instruction.“Religious education is open to all students regardless of their religion or world view. In some instances, parents or students over the age of 18 wish to opt out of religious education. This is fully permitted in ETB schools. “However, our schools have not been provided with any additional resources to provide alternative classes to students who opt out. Our schools cater for these students to the best of their ability with the resources currently available to them.”What about community schools?Ms White insisted that ETB schools are “multidenominational and cater for all students regardless of their religious or non-religious beliefs”.Many community schools are also not implementing the circular, which also requires schools to proactively establish the wishes of parents in relation to opting out of religious worship or instruction.The circular states this should be integrated with the school’s processes for establishing subject choices generally.“Past practice of assuming that the pupil body is predominately Catholic and arranging religious instruction accordingly is no longer an appropriate approach,” the circular states.“ In a changing context the constitutional right not to attend religious instruction must be given effect through changed practices.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973985.1564648735!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ready for the bank holiday weekend here is the weather forecast","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBeachgoers enjoy the sunshine in Margate in south east England last week.

The temperatures will drop back down to around 19 or 20 degrees from Saturday.” Cloud will increase through Saturday morning as scattered outbreaks of showery rain develop across Munster and gradually extend eastwards during the day. Heavy rain will tend to be patchy in the east of the country with highest temperatures between 18 and 22 degrees. Sunday is expected to be sunny with broken cloud and scattered showers at times and top temperatures between 19 and 23 degrees. Monday will have a dry start with increasing cloud and rain set to spread from the Atlantic during the afternoon. Highest temperatures are expected to be between 19 and 22 degrees.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe cost of alcohol in Irish off-licences has fallen to such a level that women can now hit their weekly alcohol consumption limit by spending under €5, while the ceiling for men can be hit for less than €7.50, according to a new report. In its annual market review and pricing survey released on Thursday, Alcohol Action Ireland (AAI) also found there was little difference between the alcohol prices found in urban and rural areas and in big supermarkets and small off-licences. It said men were able to reach the guideline weekly consumption limit by spending €7.48, with the cost for women put at €4.84. Cider was found to be the cheapest strong alcohol on the market, with a standard drink selling in off-licences for as little as 44 cent, followed by beer, wine and a range of spirits. According to HSE low-risk weekly guidelines on consumption, men should drink no more than 17 standard drinks – with one standard drink being a small glass of wine or beer – while it is recommended that women consume no more than 11 such drinks. The AAI report said its research demonstrated “the remarkable affordability of alcohol to everyday shoppers” and it called for the urgent commencement of legislation aimed at imposing minimum prices on alcohol. The survey also highlighted what the AAI said was “the sophisticated retailing model deployed nationwide – urban, regional and rural – by the alcohol industry, with prices in convenience shops in rural towns in line with prices in big supermarkets in urban centres”. He said that given “the remarkable, universal affordability of alcohol in Ireland, any reduction in the cost would be utterly destructive of public health objectives and aims to reduce our excessive consumption”. There is a “clear and urgent need for the Government and the Minister for Health to immediately commence the minimum unit pricing of alcohol products, which passed into law last October but lies stuck in political inertia”, he said.He concluded by saying the availability of such cheap, strong alcohol was “killing our people. “It is simply incredible that economic interest would continue to be advanced ahead of a public health measure that would benefit the wellbeing of our youth and those at high risk because of alcohol.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3973454.1564641028!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and coveney acting like fools over brexit claims bruce arnold","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘What is tough is watching the ridiculous behaviour of the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his foreign minister, Simon Coveney, trying to destroy, like wilful children, relations with an ancient and friendly neighbour’, Bruce Arnold writes in the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney are “uncertain fools” acting like “wilful children” in the destruction of Anglo-Irish relations, journalist Bruce Arnold has said.The UK is currently engaged in a stand-off with Dublin and Brussels over the withdrawal agreement that would secure the UK’s orderly exit from the EU. London is refusing to accept the inclusion of the backstop while Europe is refusing to drop it. Arnold, in an opinion article for the Daily  published on Wednesday, delivered a scathing assessment of the Government’s policy and approach to Brexit. “This is tough right now, being a proud and loyal British subject who has lived in, and loved, Ireland for more than 60 years,” he wrote in the piece, headlined ‘Bought by Brussels, little Ireland’s ridiculous leaders have landed it in a Brexit crisis’. “What is tough is watching the ridiculous behaviour of the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his foreign minister, Simon Coveney, trying to destroy, like wilful children, relations with an ancient and friendly neighbour.“Whatever faults the British may have, they understand independence and freedom. I can understand why they mock the ridiculous behaviour of these two men.“Varadkar and Coveney are both members of Fine Gael, a party that has its roots in the fight 100 years ago to secure independence and freedom for Ireland. Yet now here they are trying to block the UK’s path to the same independence and freedom.”He described this approach as “painful and embarrassing stuff”, and was highly critical of the EU’s treatment of the UK.“It was bad enough these past months having to witness the humiliations of the journeys to Brussels of prime minister Theresa May,” he said. “Begging at the European Commission and European Council brought her nothing.“One cannot be surprised that Boris Johnson is so far refusing to go to Brussels. He is smart enough not to hazard a rerun of Theresa May’s ill-judged visits to the groups that became her tormentors. “The European Parliament had a brief walk-on part in the humiliations – to approve the draft agreement. They seemed from time to time to be sniggering behind their hands at this unfortunate woman who was betrayed on all sides.”‘Cheerleaders’ Arnold, who has written for several newspapers including The , the Irish Press, the Sunday Independent, and the , accused Dublin of acting as “cheerleader for these tormentors”.“Yet their cheerleading operates in terms that make no sense at all,” he said. “Varadkar and Coveney are increasingly uncertain fools. Their desire to be players in a game they don’t understand is causing their clothing to unravel and their minds to lose their way.“Their determination to work against the UK’s desire for a smooth and prosperous Brexit will in the end leave Ireland diplomatically estranged from its most important trade and political partner.“With some satisfaction I see that public opinion in Ireland is at last questioning their policies.” Arnold, who was awarded an OBE in 2003 “for services to Irish journalism and Anglo-Irish relations”, said Brussels was using the “iel-like euro-eagerness” of the Government “for its own ends”.He added: “Once Brussels gets what it wants, it will dump all interest in Irish concerns.“What Varadkar and Coveney are doing is helping Brussels to block the path for the UK government to implement the democratic decision of the British people to leave the EU. There was a referendum. The people gave their decision.“And yet a Dublin government which brags that it is republican and democratic denigrates this decision as populism. It colludes with the EU to try to have the decision dismissed and resisted.” Arnold’s article in the Daily , which is a Eurosceptic, pro-Brexit, and Tory-leaning publication, was also critical of the Republic’s decision to rerun referendums to ratify the Nice Treaty in 2002 and the Lisbon Treaty seven years later.He described the Lisbon Treaty as “a camouflaged EU constitution which would dissolve their republic into a new supranational state”. The Irish constitution, he said, “is now no more than a worthless gathering of sad memories”.“If you want to understand Varadkar and Coveney’s behaviour, the Lisbon sell-out is the key,” he continued. “Irish politicians are honest: when they are bought, they stay bought. “These uncertain fools have now led Ireland to be engulfed in a crisis as Boris Johnson, the new prime minister, seeks to lead Britain out of the EU either before or after an election.“Yet again we face a crisis of democracy, with little Ireland and the huge EU refusing to recognise the democratic decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. The ridiculous country in which I live is helping Europe in this abuse.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

It set off a flurry of jokes on Twitter about the 76-year-old’s ineptitude with technology and a digital race to buy similar domain names.Josh Fayer, a 21-year-old public relations student at Syracuse University in New York, said he had just stopped watching the debate when a friend texted to say he had bought the domain name the former vice-president cited.They decided to redirect it to Mr Fayer’s parody presidential campaign site: “Josh for America”, which Mr Fayer said he launched as an April Fool’s joke this year.Mr Fayer’s site introduces him as “the first Gen Z’er to declare candidacy for this office” and includes a video that stated his platform of “no homework in college”.Mr Fayer said his parody election bid originally garnered only a few retweets but that his site had more than 53,000 views just minutes after the debate in Detroit finished.He said he did not want to endorse any presidential candidate. But late on Wednesday, his site’s donate button sent visitors to a page inviting them to “donate to our good friend Pete Buttigieg’s campaign”.The campaign for Mr Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is one of Mr Biden’s rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A similar domain, joe3030, also was directing people to Mr Buttigieg’s campaign site.It appears that Mr Biden meant to direct voters to his campaign’s texting platform, a popular digital fundraising strategy. Without mentioning the gaffe, the @JoeBiden Twitter handle sent out the correct call to action in a tweet immediately following the debate.Yet another similar URL, joe33030, directed people on Wednesday to Mr Biden’s official campaign website.A spokesman for the Biden campaign declined to comment. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson chairs first no-deal war cabinet as he faces first electoral testJudge spares three criminals jail for serious assault because case took so long to be heard in courtAfter Theresa May\u0026#39s deluge of leaks, Dominic Cummings is out to save Boris Johnson by plugging the dyke\u0026#39No doctor with any sense would train to be a GP\u0026#39 -

And Twitch, like all apps that allow two-way communication and live streaming, present particular risks to children of being groomed.“These sites need to ensure they are doing everything they can to protect children on their platforms.A Twitch spokesman said: The safety of our community is a top priority and one in which we are perpetually investing.We take any issues or accusations of this nature extremely seriously, and as soon as we become aware of a possible instance of exploitation we swiftly take the content down and report it to relevant law enforcement as appropriate.  The NSPCC’s warning comes as it released the results of a survey of 2,000 11 to 17-year-olds that found one in 25 has received or been asked to send sexual material to an adult online.When compared to the population of more than five million children in the UK of that age, the NSPCC estimates this means up to 201,000 are being subject to attempted grooming. According to the survey, the most common social media sites where children experienced grooming were Snapchat and Facebook, where one in 25 using those networks said they had received such requests.The second most common sites were Twitch and Twitter, with one in 33 reporting having such experiences.As a result, the charity called called for social media and tech companies to share more data with each help catch groomers and disable friend suggestion algorithms for children.Duty of Care campaign | Read morePeter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said: “The scale of risk that children face on social networks revealed in this research cannot be ignored and tackling it with robust and comprehensive legislation needs to be a priority for this government.   “Tech firms need to be forced to get a grip of the abuse taking place on their sites by using technology to identify suspicious behaviour and designing young people’s accounts with built-in protections.”Following the findings, Antigone Davis, Facebook Head of Global Safety, said: “Keeping young people safe on our platforms is a top priority for us.“In addition to using technology to proactively detect grooming and prevent child sexual exploitation on our platform, we work with child protection experts, including specialist law enforcement teams like CEOP in the UK, to keep young people safe.“Ninety nine percent of child nudity content is removed from our platform automatically.”A spokesman for Snapchat added: “We are concerned that predators are using other, less private, apps to locate potential victims and then steer them to Snapchat or other private messaging platforms.

So please, no gifts and no pressure. But if you feel so inclined, we welcome putting on the best party ever for our family and friends,” the couple wrote on a specially set-up website.“Instead of a traditional registry, we’re accepting donations towards the cost of the wedding.”Knox posted this image of herself shortly before traveling to Italy to talk about the Kercher murder and miscarriages of justicePeople who donate will receive a “signed, limited edition” of a joint book of love poems which the couple have called The Cardio Tesseract.They said they had spent all their wedding funds on a trip to Italy in June, when Knox spoke about the murder and her initial conviction at a conference on miscarriages of justice in the city of Modena.But it has now emerged that the couple are already married, having tied the knot in secret in December.Records from King County, Washington State, show that they made a marriage application on Nov 21 last year, and were officially married on December 7.Knox and her fiancé put out a statement on Thursday in response to criticism that they had misled friends, family and supporters.They admitted that they were already married.“We filed paperwork to be legally married in December of last year to simplify our taxes and insurance,” the wrote.They said the event in February would be a celebration of the wedding “with our loved ones”.Meredith Kercher was murdered in Perugia, Umbria, in a house she shared with Amanda KnoxKnox also admitted that she had received significant financial help to attend the event in Modena by an NGO called the Italy Innocence Project.But she said she had still spent $10,000 on security measures, travel expenses for her mother and flights.“The trip was a financial setback for us and we were forced to use funds we’d been saving for our wedding.”The space-age theme of the wedding promises, according to Knox and her boyfriend, “Vikings drinking pan-galactic gargle blasters, mutants schmoozing with Grecian queens and cyborgs.”The couple promise their guests “outrageous costumes, crazier puzzles, mind-bending sets and extravagant alien food.”Ms Kercher, from Surrey, was 21 when she was found dead with her throat cut in the cottage she shared with Knox and two Italian women in Perugia, a hill-town in Umbria that is popular with foreign students.A local drifter named Rudy Guede was tried, convicted and sentenced to 16 years in jail for the murder, with DNA evidence linking him to the sexual assault and killing of Ms Kercher.Knox posted photos of herself dressed as Little Red Riding Hood on social mediaBut suspicion also fell on Knox and her then boyfriend, Italian student Raffaele Sollecito – prosecutors said they had acted with Guede, knifing Ms Kercher to death after a sex game turned violent.They were convicted and sentenced to 26 years in prison.The convictions were overturned in 2011 and Knox immediately returned to the US.In her absence, the acquittals were thrown out by an Italian appeals court, before being upheld by the supreme court in Rome in 2015, when Knox and Sollecito were definitively cleared of the crimes.Knox broke down in tears on stage in Modena when she recounted the murder and her subsequent imprisonment.“The truth is that Raffaele and I did not kill Meredith,” she told the audience. “I had zero motivation to kill my friend.” She said she had been cast as a “dirty, psychopathic, man-eating whore.”Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson chairs first no-deal war cabinet as he faces first electoral testJudge spares three criminals jail for serious assault because case took so long to be heard in courtAfter Theresa May\u0026#39s deluge of leaks, Dominic Cummings is out to save Boris Johnson by plugging the dyke\u0026#39No doctor with any sense would train to be a GP\u0026#39 -

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.It continues: “The BBC intends to change BBC iPlayer from a 30-day catch up service, to one where programmes are available for 12 months as standard, with some available for longer.”The statement adds that Ofcom undertook a BBC Competition Assessment before allowing the corporation to go ahead with their plans.Why Netflix should be seriously concerned about its latest figures Netflix sees $18bn wiped off stock market value as subscribers leaveBBC iPlayer reveals its most popular shows of 2018In a statement at the time, the BBC said that they had no expectation of triumphing over Netflix, but that allowing their content to stay on iPlayer for a lengthy period of time would “simply allow the BBC to stop the continued decline we expect to see over the next five years,” adding that lack of change would “threaten the BBC’s very ability to deliver its mission to serve all audiences and provide viewers with value for their licence fee”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its chief executive and chairman Larry Fink sends out a letter to investors each year in which he espouses\u0026nbspthe virtues of investing in with purpose and an eye on social responsibility.But analysis of the investment giant’s holdings suggests that its rhetoric on climate change risks does not match its actions, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).The research charity calculated that BlackRock’s investments in oil and gas firms have dragged down returns as those companies have destroyed value by failing to properly adapt to climate change.Created with Sketch.Fighting climate change with trees: The facts Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The study undermines arguments from some fund managers that they must invest in oil and gas firms in order to fulfil their duty to act in the best interests of investors.Three quarters of BlackRock’s estimated lost returns have stemmed from just four companies: ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Chevron, all of which have underperformed the market.A fifth company, General Electric, has lost BlackRock investors $19.1bn between 2008 and 2018, when compared to the returns it could have made by investing in shares that performed in line with the wider stock market.BlackRock holds more than half a billion shares in GE which saw an unprecedented $193bn wiped off its stock market valuation between 2016 and 2018.This brutal heatwave is our fault – let\u0027s not forget thatIEEFA attributes much of this collapse in value to the fact that GE failed to anticipate the collapse of traditional fossil-fuel power station construction, a key market for the company which supplies turbines for the plants.BlackRock’s biggest mistake during this period, according to the research, has been its stake in ExxonMobil, which could have netted investors an extra $45bn if the money had been invested elsewhere.BlackRock has consistently maintained that it cannot simply shift funds out of particular stocks because many of its funds are passively managed, meaning that investments are selected by criteria that fit with investors’ needs, rather than having a fund manager who actively picks the shares.But IEEFA argues that peers such as Amundi and Norway’s Norges Bank have developed low-carbon investment strategies that are as cost-effective as BlackRock’s passive investment strategy.As the custodians of trillions of dollars in global wealth, institutional investors are increasingly being called upon to take action to prevent climate change by removing funds from companies who are not doing enough.The problem is more and more being framed as a financial as well as an ethical one.The Bank of England last year estimated that lack of action to move towards a low-carbon future could see up to $20 trillion wiped off the value of assets as they become useless or “stranded”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It expects that official data due later this month will reveal zero economic growth in the second quarter, after a 0.5 per cent rise in the first.“The MPC judges that underlying GDP growth is likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with\u0026nbspBrexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May,” the\u0026nbspBoE\u0026nbspadded.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

The central bank\u0026nbspsees a 30 per cent chance that growth in the year to the first quarter of 2020 will turn out negative.However, it raised its growth forecast for 2021 to 2.3 per cent from 2.1 per cent.\u0026nbspThis revision reflects the boost to demand from looser monetary conditions than what was observed in May, the BoE said, referring to recent falls in short- and long-term market interest rates driven by expectations of a no-deal Brexit.The bank admitted “an inconsistency” between its assumption of a smooth Brexit and the prevailing market asset prices, which also affect its forecasts and which reflect market participants’ greater pessimism.“A more consistent forecast would therefore have somewhat lower paths for GDP growth and CPI inflation”, the BoE said.\u0026nbspIt forecast that consumer price inflation would rise above its 2 per cent target in two years’ time.If there is a no-deal Brexit, the pound will fall, inflation rise and GDP growth will slow, the bank forecast, reiterating its previous message that it could move interest rates up or down, depending on the balance of the various effects of such an outcome.But Mr Carney warned there are “limits” to what the BoE can do to support the economy in the event of an abrupt\u0026nbspBrexit. He said\u0026nbspmonetary policy\u0026nbspcannot offset the\u0026nbspeffects of shocks such as Brexit but it can help smooth the economy’s adjustment to these shocks.What the bank has the most power\u0026nbspover is returning inflation to its 2 per cent target. The pound’s\u0026nbspfurther depreciation in the event of a chaotic Brexit will lead to higher prices, although with a lag, according to\u0026nbspanother MPC\u0026nbspmember Ben Broadbent.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspA fall in the pound will take several years to feed through to inflation, he noted, but added that in some areas, such as petrol and food, prices tend to react “quite quickly”.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The sales of iPhones took a 12 per cent tumble and the company’s earnings fell by a similar amount. Yet the shares jumped in after-hours trading.\u0026nbspAs ever, this was partly down to expectations: Wall Street had forecast a deeper e.\u0026nbspThe markets were also buoyed by what chief\u0026nbspexecutive Tim Cook had to say about the future, with new iPhone models on the way, together with his talk about a “marked improvement” in China.\u0026nbspTrump attacks Apple’s plea for tariff waivers on new Mac Pro partsApple buys Intel 5G modem business, dropping major hint at new iPhoneNew iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakBut with this latest set of figures, the company also crossed a rubicon. Its signature product, for the first time in years, provided\u0026nbspless than half the firm’s revenues in a three-month quarter. The latest covered\u0026nbspthe period up to 29 June. It is\u0026nbspthe third of Apple’s financial year and in it the iPhone accounted for 48 per cent, compared to 55 per cent over the same period in 2018.\u0026nbspIts dwindling sales might have been taken more seriously but for the fact that they were more than offset by growth in other areas, helping Apple to post a modest increase in overall revenues – $53.8bn (£44.1bn) against $53.3bn last time.\u0026nbspThe boom in Apple services –\u0026nbspincluding music subscriptions, the App Store, Apple Pay, and Apple TV –\u0026nbsphas been a longstanding theme, and that continued.\u0026nbspMore than 400 million people now have some sort of subscription with the company. It will hope to add to their number through Apple TV+, a new streaming service coming in the autumn, although it is entering an increasingly crowded field at a time when even the mighty Netflix is starting to encounter some price resistance, at least in North America.But that’s far from the only new string being added to the company’s bow. A credit card is coming in August too. It’s not only Amazon that could easily be renamed World Domination Enterprises. Apple is also sending its tanks out to occupy an ever-growing number of lawns and causing shivers down the spines of an ever-growing number of competitors.\u0026nbspDespite all this activity, services didn’t even make the biggest noise in this\u0026nbspset of results, as they have become accustomed to doing. Nor did\u0026nbspMacs or iPads, both of which grew handily. The unit shouting loudest was, in fact, “Wearables, Home and\u0026nbspAccessories” which recorded growth of 48 per cent.\u0026nbspThis is made up of a rag bag of different product lines including smart speakers, headphones, and especially the Apple Watch, which has started to come (very) good for the company after a decidedly rocky start.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

That’s no longer the case.\u0026nbspInnovative? Not so much, not anymore.

It’s certainly become a lot bigger under his successor Tim Cook, who might just be the better businessman and now has Wall Street eating out of his hands.

As the port with the\u0026nbspshortest distance to Northern Ireland,\u0026nbspthe harbour had once been the lifeblood of the village. Long before email, 10,000 mail packets made their way from Portpatrick and across the sea to Donaghadee.\u0026nbspThe railway came to Portpatrick in 1862, shortly before the cross-channel steamer services moved to nearby Stranraer. When the government switched the mail service to Stranraer, passengers on the railway between the two villages dwindled, and Portpatrick harbour became the preserve for a small fleet of fishermen and some pleasure boats.\u0026nbspHow the look of council estates has changed over a centuryLabour vows to end ‘rip-off’ by ensuring councils take back servicesThird of councils fear they will be unable to provide vital services“Steam killed the village for sailboats coming in,” Robert Erskine, a lifeboat coxswain since 1984, told me in 2016. “It’s now more a leisure harbour. But it’s still very important as it’s the centrepoint of the village.”I was in Portpatrick to report on a\u0026nbsphistoric moment for residents. In 2015, frustrated at the lack of maintenance by the harbour’s private owners, local people made the decision to organise as a community benefit society, an organisation accountable to the community, and sell shares to buy their harbour and secure the village’s future.\u0026nbspThree and a half years later, the community-owned harbour has catalysed the regeneration\u0026nbspof several other buildings in the village. The society has acquired a row of toilets and a patch of land near the harbour from Dumfries and Galloway council, at a price of £1, to save the facility from closure. Two people have been employed directly by the society to service the toilets.\u0026nbspThe society has now applied to transfer the local village hall into community ownership under the Communities Empowerment Act Scotland 2015.“People are coming to the village and making the comment that they can see the changes,” says Calum Currie, chair of the Portpatrick\u0026nbspCommunity Benefit Society. “The harbour is much busier. We have now made the harbour a venue from which we’re looking at doing more festivals and events.”In England, there are more than 6,300 assets like the Portpatrick harbour\u0026nbspin community ownership, according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and Power to Change. These community halls, sports centres, parks and other spaces contribute nearly £220m to the UK economy every year, its research shows.Three-quarters of these assets are reported to be in good financial health. And the sector is growing: one third of the\u0026nbspassets came into community ownership in the last year.“This is a surprisingly good story,” says Ailbhe McNabola, head of\u0026nbspresearch\u0026nbspat Power to Change. “The proportion of assets in good financial health is really promising. Councils are under huge pressure financially, but with the assets they can dispose of, they are thinking about the community first and how they can continue to provide access.”\u0026nbspUnder the Localism Act of 2011, community organisations have the right to delay the sale of a building or land so that they can develop a bid. They might also register the building or space as an “asset of community value” in order to be alerted if the asset comes up for sale. In Scotland, the government has conferred additional rights to community groups to buy large landholdings and estates through a Right to Buy, which enables the forced disposal of a property if it is abandoned, neglected or detrimental in some way.Eighty per cent of the assets transferred into community ownership are community centres such as village halls. When these are taken out of the equation, the rate of community asset transfer for other assets such as sports centres, parks, open space and libraries is increasing even faster, McNabola says.\u0026nbspIn Wolverhampton, the council has given a longterm lease for a piece of land and stadium to Bilston Town Community Football Club, giving it ownership over an asset that has helped the club survive during a difficult financial period. In Liverpool, a piece of neglected local authority land was sold to Squash, a community food initiative, and is now occupied by modern cafe, gallery and gardens. Meanwhile in Dauntsey Lock, Wiltshire, residents registered a local pub, The Peterborough Arms, as an asset of community value to give them the time to raise £225,000 to buy it from private owners who wanted to turn it into residential property.“It’s a combination of a good policy environment, which has raised the profile of community asset transfers, and austerity, where councils have had their budgets cut are not able to maintain buildings in the way they once did,” McNabola\u0026nbspsays. She notes the\u0026nbspexample of community-run libraries, which have grown from very small numbers to an estimated 500 in England by the end of 2018.These community asset transfers are part of a much broader picture of councils selling assets to stay in the black as their grant from the central government has shrunk by 60 per cent since 2010. In March, an investigation by the Bureau Local and Huffington Post revealed that local authorities have sold more than 12,000 public spaces since 2014-15.\u0026nbspBut McNabola\u0026nbspsays that when asset transfers are done well, everyone benefits. “You have to make sure that the assets handed over are not a liability and that councils are working with communities in a sustainable way,” she says. “A council should be there to help with the self-realisation of the community, not to make money.”\u0026nbspThe transition from owning a community asset to doing buildings and facilities management can be a challenge for community organisations. “It’s about engaging with the community early on, thinking about governance and making sure the group has the support they need,” McNabola\u0026nbspsays.Austerity-hit councils in \u0027Great British selloff\u0027 of public buildingsDumfries and Galloway Council says that its approach to community asset transfer is to support communities to develop their ideas to deliver services with and for the local community. “At a time of austerity, when councils cannot deliver all of the traditional services, we work with communities to help them realise their ambitions and provide local solutions to local issues,” a spokesperson said. The council noted that it only transfers a property when it can be assured that the business plan is supported by the local community and able to generate a sustainable income.Currie believes the Portpatrick\u0026nbspHarbour Community Benefit Society now has\u0026nbspa stable of assets that will support its acquisition of the village hall – and help them break even in the first year.\u0026nbsp“For a community group to take on a village hall takes a lot of planning and involvement,” he says. “But we have the support of the village.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its chief executive and chairman Larry Fink sends out a letter to investors each year in which he espouses\u0026nbspthe virtues of investing in with purpose and an eye on social responsibility.But analysis of the investment giant’s holdings suggests that its rhetoric on climate change risks does not match its actions, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).The research charity calculated that BlackRock’s investments in oil and gas firms have dragged down returns as those companies have destroyed value by failing to properly adapt to climate change.Created with Sketch.Fighting climate change with trees: The facts Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The study undermines arguments from some fund managers that they must invest in oil and gas firms in order to fulfil their duty to act in the best interests of investors.Three quarters of BlackRock’s estimated lost returns have stemmed from just four companies: ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Chevron, all of which have underperformed the market.A fifth company, General Electric, has lost BlackRock investors $19.1bn between 2008 and 2018, when compared to the returns it could have made by investing in shares that performed in line with the wider stock market.BlackRock holds more than half a billion shares in GE which saw an unprecedented $193bn wiped off its stock market valuation between 2016 and 2018.This brutal heatwave is our fault – let\u0027s not forget thatIEEFA attributes much of this collapse in value to the fact that GE failed to anticipate the collapse of traditional fossil-fuel power station construction, a key market for the company which supplies turbines for the plants.BlackRock’s biggest mistake during this period, according to the research, has been its stake in ExxonMobil, which could have netted investors an extra $45bn if the money had been invested elsewhere.BlackRock has consistently maintained that it cannot simply shift funds out of particular stocks because many of its funds are passively managed, meaning that investments are selected by criteria that fit with investors’ needs, rather than having a fund manager who actively picks the shares.But IEEFA argues that peers such as Amundi and Norway’s Norges Bank have developed low-carbon investment strategies that are as cost-effective as BlackRock’s passive investment strategy.As the custodians of trillions of dollars in global wealth, institutional investors are increasingly being called upon to take action to prevent climate change by removing funds from companies who are not doing enough.The problem is more and more being framed as a financial as well as an ethical one.The Bank of England last year estimated that lack of action to move towards a low-carbon future could see up to $20 trillion wiped off the value of assets as they become useless or “stranded”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It expects that official data due later this month will reveal zero economic growth in the second quarter, after a 0.5 per cent rise in the first.“The MPC judges that underlying GDP growth is likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with\u0026nbspBrexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May,” the\u0026nbspBoE\u0026nbspadded.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

The debate deepened after reports a video had been filmed by private investigators of sex acts taking place in the clubSpeaking to reporters after the publication of the Inflation Report, BoE governor Mark Carney pointed\u0026nbspout that UK business investment remains low both historically and compared with other countries.\u0026nbspThe bank\u0026nbspcut its forecasts for growth this year and next to 1.3 per cent, from 1.5 and 1.6 per cent respectively predicted in May.\u0026nbspDespite the\u0026nbspBoE’s continued assumption that Britain will leave the EU with a deal in October, the Inflation Report showed that the probability of recession has risen in its view. The central bank\u0026nbspsees a 30 per cent chance that growth in the year to the first quarter of 2020 will turn out negative.However, it raised its growth forecast for 2021 to 2.3 per cent from 2.1 per cent.\u0026nbspThis revision reflects the boost to demand from looser monetary conditions than what was observed in May, the BoE said, referring to recent falls in short- and long-term market interest rates driven by expectations of a no-deal Brexit.The bank admitted “an inconsistency” between its assumption of a smooth Brexit and the prevailing market asset prices, which also affect its forecasts and which reflect market participants’ greater pessimism.“A more consistent forecast would therefore have somewhat lower paths for GDP growth and CPI inflation”, the BoE said.\u0026nbspIt forecast that consumer price inflation would rise above its 2 per cent target in two years’ time.If there is a no-deal Brexit, the pound will fall, inflation rise and GDP growth will slow, the bank forecast, reiterating its previous message that it could move interest rates up or down, depending on the balance of the various effects of such an outcome.But Mr Carney warned there are “limits” to what the BoE can do to support the economy in the event of an abrupt\u0026nbspBrexit. He said\u0026nbspmonetary policy\u0026nbspcannot offset the\u0026nbspeffects of shocks such as Brexit but it can help smooth the economy’s adjustment to these shocks.What the bank has the most power\u0026nbspover is returning inflation to its 2 per cent target.

Spotify shares fell 5 per cent following the update for investors on Wednesday.“We missed on subs. That’s on us,” Spotify’s founder and chief executive Daniel Ek said, referring to subscriber numbers. He said the company expects to “make up lost ground before year-end”.Spotify is still the most popular music streaming service in the world, with almost double the number of paid-up members of its nearest rival Apple.Revenue from subscribers, which accounts for around 90 per cent of Spotify’s overall revenue, rose to €1.5bn (£1.3bn) in the second quarter.Created with Sketch.Spotify tips and tricks Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Search more accuratelyYou can improve the accuracy of your searches by adding extra information, such as dates, genres and albums.

However, the company faces renewed challenges, not least from Google and Amazon, which have both recently launched free versions of their own music streaming services.Google and Amazon deliver music streaming through their respective smart speakers and are hoping to use their hardware offerings to quickly increase subscriber numbers.The set-up has upset Spotify. Earlier this year it filed a complaint with the European Commission against Apple, accusing the company of stifling competition to the detriment of consumers. Spotify argued that Apple makes it difficult for third-party streaming services to establish themselves on devices like the iPhone and iPad.Purchases of apps and subscriptions on Apple devices must be paid for through Apple’s payment system. Apple takes a 30 per cent cut of these payments, including for Spotify\u0027s premium service, which Spotify claims gives its rival an unfair price advantage.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Manufacturing has now shrank for three consecutive months. The last time managers reported weaker activity was in February 2013.Production volumes hit a seven-year low, dragged down partly because manufacturers sold off stocks built up to prepare for the Brexit deadline of 31 March, said IHS Markit which compiled the data.While some firms were still running down stocks bolstered before\u0026nbspthe original Brexit date, others were re-starting these stockpiling efforts in preparation for the new October deadline, IHS Markit said.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, said: A killer combination of economic uncertainty and the weakest production levels for seven years, battered the manufacturing sector into contraction for the third consecutive month in July.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

The decline in new export business mainly reflected lower intakes from the EU and China.The latest\u0026nbspgrim indicator for the UK economy came as Boris Johnson stepped up plans for a no-deal Brexit widely expected to cause significant disruption to businesses and consumers.UK manufacturing output and optimism tumble to multi-year lows – CBIHowever, manufacturers maintained a positive outlook in July with more than 46 per cent expecting output to be higher in a years\u0027 time than it is now, compared to just 10 per cent predicting output will be lower.Managers pointed to new product launches, an expected rebound in exports and reduced uncertainty following Brexit\u0026nbspas reasons to be optimistic.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit said manufacturers were suffocating under the choke-hold of slower global growth and political uncertainty.“The weak, highly competitive environment makes a sustained revival highly unlikely in the coming months.However, a short-lived bounce leading up to October should not be ruled out, as some manufacturers are already gearing up to re-start Brexit preparations.If so, expect a case of déjà-vu during quarter four, as another correction in inventory holdings hits growth in the lead-up to year-end.The pound sank to a two-and-a-half year low against the dollar on Tuesday.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, the company faces renewed challenges, not least from Google and Amazon, which have both recently launched free versions of their own music streaming services.Google and Amazon deliver music streaming through their respective smart speakers and are hoping to use their hardware offerings to quickly increase subscriber numbers.The set-up has upset Spotify. Earlier this year it filed a complaint with the European Commission against Apple, accusing the company of stifling competition to the detriment of consumers. Spotify argued that Apple makes it difficult for third-party streaming services to establish themselves on devices like the iPhone and iPad.Purchases of apps and subscriptions on Apple devices must be paid for through Apple’s payment system. Apple takes a 30 per cent cut of these payments, including for Spotify\u0027s premium service, which Spotify claims gives its rival an unfair price advantage.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The birth rate was the lowest ever recorded, when births are measured as a proportion of the total population.“The total fertility rate stood at 1.7 children per woman, lower than all years except 1977 and 1999 to 2002.“The proportion of live births to non-UK mothers fell for the first time since 1990. The stillbirth rate reached the lowest level recorded for the second year running.“There were 657,076 live births last year, the fewest since 2005 and a drop of almost 10 per cent\u0026nbspsince 2012.”Clea Harmer, chief executive at stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands, said: “This continuing downward trend in the deaths of babies before birth is very welcome but, until the figures can be seen alongside mortality rates for babies who die shortly after birth, it is too early to comment on whether we are on track to meet the English Government’s ambition to halve deaths by 2025.”Additional reporting by PA\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even countries that do apply a time limit to immigration detention do not operate such a short one.”A number of high-profile Conservative MPs have told The Independent the Home Office must urgently reconsider this decision.Immigration detainees\u0026nbspheld for more than 28 daysFormer Brexit secretary David Davis said it was a “very bad decision”, adding: “I urge the home secretary to review it as a matter of urgency, since I believe that parliament will take a different view to the government on this matter.”Describing the absence of a time limit as “clearly perverse”, Mr Davis said: “People who have been human trafficked are effectively being treated as criminals with indeterminate sentences. What really puts the public at risk is the Home Office’s poor administration of its deportation policy.\u0026nbsp“Furthermore, it is by no means clear that people who are held in detention centres are those who are a real risk to the public, since there is evidence of people who are a risk being released early.”Andrew Mitchell, former international development secretary, said: “I am sure that the Home Office will want to think carefully about this because when the matter comes before the House of Commons, as it undoubtedly will, the House of Commons may well take a different view.”Home Office should no longer have power to detain people, MPs sayFormer attorney-general Dominic Grieve said he was sorry to hear the Home Office’s response, adding that failing to implement a time limit was “leading to injustice”.\u0026nbspHe continued: “It was never going to be a blanket demand, but we need an adequate limit, rather than the system which prevails at the moment, where people can be detained for very long periods even though the Home Office doesn’t want it, and then they eventually release the people back into the community.”The Independent recently reported on the case of a Zimbabwean man who\u0026nbspwas detained under immigration powers for more than four years – an experience he said made him feel suicidal.In April, the prisons watchdog revealed self-harm among detainees in Colnbrook removal centre, one of Britain’s largest detention centres, had surged threefold in the last three years despite a considerable drop in the population.People detained under Immigration Act powers in 2018In response to Ms Nokes’ letter, chair of the committee, Harriet Harman, said: “Home Office immigration detention is arbitrary, unfair and breaches human rights. Repeated detention and release, which characterises the system, shows that it must be reformed.“Parliament will have the opportunity to consider changing the law to protect people from arbitrary detention when the Immigration Bill is brought back.\u0026nbspI’m hopeful that with the strong cross-party backing for the proposals from our committee and the Home Affairs Committee it will do so.”Pierre Makhlouf, assistant director at Bail for Immigration Detainees, condemned\u0026nbspthe Home Office’s “cavalier attitude to the deprivation of liberty”,\u0026nbspadding: “The government\u0026nbspignores the fact that people are held in immigration detention sometimes for months and years when their removal cannot be enforced.”A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“No one is detained indefinitely. Most people detained under immigration powers spend only short periods in detention.\u0026nbsp“We have made significant improvements recently, but we are committed to doing more and introducing further alternatives to detention, increasing transparency and improving the support available for vulnerable detainees.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In most cases, Johnson will be able to rely on the support of Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover, who had the Tory whip removed this month when he was charged with sexual assault, an accusation he denies.\u0026nbspThe reason Jeremy Corbyn held back from tabling a motion of no confidence in Johnson’s government last week was that it was certain to be defeated: in addition to Elphicke, Sylvia Hermon, the independent unionist MP, voted with Theresa May in the last vote of no confidence in January, and Ivan Lewis and John Woodcock, former Labour MPs, abstained.\u0026nbspYet the arithmetic of a future vote of no confidence, if it were designed to stop Johnson pursuing a no-deal Brexit, is unpredictable, and every single vote could count.\u0026nbspIf Jane Dodds, the Liberal Democrat candidate and the party’s leader in Wales, wins the by-election, it will tilt the balance in the House of Commons a bit further against a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Boris Johnson\u0027s cabinet: Who\u0027s in and who\u0027s out Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerJacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerSo what is going to happen? Only one opinion poll has been carried out in the constituency, by Number Cruncher Politics, which put Dodds on 43 per cent, 15 points ahead of Chris Davies, the Tory candidate, whose conviction for expenses fraud caused the by-election.\u0026nbspDes Parkinson, the Brexit Party candidate, was in third place on 20 per cent, with Labour’s Tom Davies trailing on 8 per cent.\u0026nbspBut that poll was carried out between 10 and 18 July, a week before Johnson became prime minister, so it is possible that Davies might benefit from the national “Boris bounce” in the Tories’ favour. In national opinion polls there has been a shift of about 5 per cent of voters from the Brexit Party to the Tories. That is not going to be enough to hold the seat, which makes the Tories’ decision to allow Davies to stand again – after he was dismissed by a petition signed by 19 per cent of his constituents – all the more curious.\u0026nbspWhat does the Remain parties’ pact for the Brecon by-election mean?The by-election has also been hailed as a test of a common front among the Remain parties, because Plaid Cymru and the Green Party decided stand aside to give the Lib Dems a free run. As Plaid Cymru won a mere three\u0026nbspper cent of the vote in the 2017 election, and the Greens didn’t have a candidate, this wasn’t such a great sacrifice – and in any case the Lib Dems were well placed to contest the seat, having held it between 1997 and 2015.\u0026nbspAll the same, a Lib Dem win today will be a small but significant gain for Remainers, and and for all opponents of a no-deal Brexit, despite the constituency having voted, in line with the nation as a whole,\u0026nbspby 52 per cent to leave the EU in the referendum.brecon and radnorshire by-election\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

emerges,” added the peer, who vowed to pursue the “rather bizarre” matter further.In a separate interview, he said: “This case goes back to 2012, it was actually secretary of state Theresa Villiers who was in office when the case was settled, so it\u0027s not a new issue, but we made the very simple point that while respecting of course the fact that people here have different identities and aspirations, nevertheless if you are working in a UK Government department, it\u0027s not unreasonable to expect to see at some stage a photograph of the head of state.”Last month Lord Maginnis told the House of Lords that a civil servant had been paid the compensation for “hurt feelings and distress” caused by having to walk past portraits of Elizabeth II.The former Ulster Unionist Party MP

Manufacturing has now shrank for three consecutive months. The last time managers reported weaker activity was in February 2013.Production volumes hit a seven-year low, dragged down partly because manufacturers sold off stocks built up to prepare for the Brexit deadline of 31 March, said IHS Markit which compiled the data.While some firms were still running down stocks bolstered before\u0026nbspthe original Brexit date, others were re-starting these stockpiling efforts in preparation for the new October deadline, IHS Markit said.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, said: A killer combination of economic uncertainty and the weakest production levels for seven years, battered the manufacturing sector into contraction for the third consecutive month in July.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

The decline in new export business mainly reflected lower intakes from the EU and China.The latest\u0026nbspgrim indicator for the UK economy came as Boris Johnson stepped up plans for a no-deal Brexit widely expected to cause significant disruption to businesses and consumers.UK manufacturing output and optimism tumble to multi-year lows – CBIHowever, manufacturers maintained a positive outlook in July with more than 46 per cent expecting output to be higher in a years\u0027 time than it is now, compared to just 10 per cent predicting output will be lower.Managers pointed to new product launches, an expected rebound in exports and reduced uncertainty following Brexit\u0026nbspas reasons to be optimistic.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit said manufacturers were suffocating under the choke-hold of slower global growth and political uncertainty.“The weak, highly competitive environment makes a sustained revival highly unlikely in the coming months.However, a short-lived bounce leading up to October should not be ruled out, as some manufacturers are already gearing up to re-start Brexit preparations.If so, expect a case of déjà-vu during quarter four, as another correction in inventory holdings hits growth in the lead-up to year-end.The pound sank to a two-and-a-half year low against the dollar on Tuesday.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This meant using WhatsApp on computers would require users to link it to the original device\u0027s account.The new upgrade will mean WhatsApp will work in a similar way to other apps like Facebook, where users can use the same login details across devices, download standalone versions of the app on any and all of their devices and have messages sync between them all.The latest WhatsApp rumour comes courtesy of WaBetaInfo, who claim the new capabilities are currently under development.Created with Sketch.12 useful WhatsApp features you didn’t know existed Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.You can unsend a message by tapping and holding it, hitting the Delete symbol and selecting Delete for Everyone.

But both in word and manner, he was not even close to convincing, and will remain vulnerable to fresh assaults from the likes of Elizabeth Warren when candidates appear at the third debate in Houston in September.“Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let him know who we are. We choose science over fiction. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over ision,” Mr Biden said in his closing remarks. “And we choose, we choose the idea that we can as Americans, when we act together, do anything.”At the first debate in Miami, Mr Biden’s main assault came from Ms Harris.

He aims to sell himself as an effective leader who is open to compromise and evidences this with his experience as governorOhio representative Tim Ryan will be running a campaign that hinges on his working class rootsOn Wednesday, Mr Biden was assailed from all sides, sometimes by more than one person at a time. (It probably did not help\u0026nbspthat he started the night by telling Ms Harris: Go easy on me kid!)He was challenged by senator Kirsten Gillibrand over an article he wrote in 1981 suggesting women should not work outside the home. He was questioned by Ms Harris over his support, until recently, for a piece of Republican-created legislation that prevents the use of federal funds to pay for abortions.He was attacked too, by Cory Booker, the senator from New Jersey who spoke both fluidly and concisely, managed to express genuine warmth, and was generally reckoned to have been among the best of the 10 candidates debating last night.“We have a real crisis in our country, and the crisis is Donald Trump — but not only Donald Trump, I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump,” Mr Booker said. “Well, that is the floor and not the ceiling.”Biden struggles to explain op-ed saying \u0027women should not be working outside of the home\u0027Mr Biden, who frequently flailed, and repeatedly referred to things he had done as vice president to Barack Obama - a reminder to many that he represented the past but not necessarily the future -\u0026nbspwas not the only one to be challenged on stage.Ms Harris, 53, who had entered the night in fourth place in most polls, was attacked several times over her mixed record as a prosecutor in California, where she has faced criticism for supporting “tough on crime” type policies. While she declined to pursue the death penalty against a man convicted of killing a police officer, for instance, she did defend the state\u0027s death penalty system in court. Her performance on Wednesday was solid, but as with Mr Biden, it paled when compared to the way progressives Bernie Sanders and Ms Warren stole the night just 24 hours earlierAmong the most powerful attacks against her came from congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, of Hawaii.“Senator Harris says she\u0027s proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she\u0027ll be a prosecutor president, but I\u0027m deeply concerned about this record,” she said. “There are too many examples to cite but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.”She added: “The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a difference and impact in these people\u0027s lives, you did not.”Among the other candidates, Washington governor Jay Inslee made a passionate case that climate change was the most important challenge facing the\u0026nbspUS, and the world. \u0026nbspBiden struggles to explain saying \u0027women should not work outside home\u0027Joe Biden needs to withdraw- the latest Democratic debate proved thatWho won and who lost the Democratic debate?Democratic debate interrupted by hecklers shouting about immigrationJoe Biden heard on hot mic asking Harris to \u0027go easy\u0027 before debate“We have one last chance. When you have one chance in life, you take it. Think about this. Literally the survival of humanity on this planet in civilization is in the hands of the next president,” said Mr Inslee, one of many of the 20 candidates who appeared over two nights\u0026nbspin Michigan hoping they did enough to qualify for the third debate in Texas.The Democratic National Committee has said it will double the qualification standards for the third debate, an attempt to thin out the crowded field. Mr Biden will certainly be there. But his performance tonight has ensured that\u0026nbsphe will again be the one his rivals will turn on.The great unknowable question is how badly these attacks damage him in the eyes of voters. After the first debate, he saw his lead slip by up to 10 points, but it had almost recovered by the time he travelled to Detroit.\u0026nbspThe challenge for Mr Biden, who did not look happy the entire night, may be less his polling numbers, rather than whether he can persuade major Democratic donors and grassroots activists that he is the man to get behind in 2020. On that question, Mr Biden still has a mountain to climb.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He then disappeared for a while, before coming back to hit\u0026nbspJoe\u0026nbspBiden\u0026nbsprepeatedly over criminal justice reform with some choice language. Booker showed none of the deference you’d expect\u0026nbspfrom a young senator to a veteran politico who served eight years as vice president – at one point dismissing Biden’s “phony rhetoric” – but that ruthlessness made his performance all the more memorable.This wasn’t in the same ballpark as her\u0026nbspperformance in the first debate, where she confronted Biden over bussing. But, after a shaky start where she sounded flustered by Biden’s energetic opening, she regained her footing. There was one uncomfortable moment\u0026nbspwhen\u0026nbspTulsi Gabbard\u0026nbspquestioned\u0026nbspher record as a prosecutor – but she didn’t fold. She’ll mark this debate as a net positive.All polling numbers suggest he’s got zero shot at winning this thing. He’s even widely\u0026nbspdisliked in his own city. But his undisputed strength is in debating. The most striking moment for him came\u0026nbspwhen he\u0026nbspasked Biden whether he tried to slow the number of deportations when he was vice president.“You want to be president of the United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions,” De Blasio said to Biden. “I guarantee you, if you’re debating Donald Trump, he’s not going to let you off the hook.”After a quiet first half, she managed to hit\u0026nbspHarris harder than Biden did at any point in the evening by pinning her down on her record as California’s attorney general.\u0026nbspIt’s a very fertile line of attack for progressives, though, and Harris knows this. She was prepared, but it was an uncomfortable moment for her.She also used her clout garnered from two tours of duty in the Middle East to good effect, saying: For too long we had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence the toll it takes on our service members.”He was hit from every angle and simply didn’t appear to have the agility to deal with it. He started off with spark when challenged on his healthcare plans, but fell back to his typical mumbles and stumbles under pressure later in the debate. While Harris converted jibes from the sidelines into jabs at her main rival, Biden found himself becoming the punching bag of everyone from Booker to De Blasio. He was, on more than one occasion, happy to immediately stop speaking when moderators asked him to finish his answer, which is generally the sign of a politician in trouble.She had one of the more memorable lines of the night (promising to deep clean the Oval Office if she became president), but failed to make a significant overall impact. At one point, she appeared to be so caught off-guard\u0026nbspby being called upon by moderators that there an awkward pause of several seconds as she gathered her thoughts. Unluckily for her, when she was getting into her stride on gender equality, the moderators cut her off.He looked like a deer in the headlights in the first debate, and needed a breakout moment on Wednesday night. Repeatedly banging the drum for his $1,000-a-month guaranteed income plan wasn’t close to enough.Considering he’s a rank outsider in the race, with little name recognition, he got a lot of face-time with the American public. He seemed to chip in on almost every exchange for an extended period of time – with his hand in the air like the earnest know-it-all at the front of the classroom. But none of the interventions felt significant enough to cut through at home.Strong on climate, forgettable on most other topics he chimed in on.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Is this national unity?”There are at least 1,000 halal shops and restaurants in the Chinese capital. Some have chosen to replace the Arabic halal signs with ones which use Chinese characters, while others visited by Reuters have simple taped over their Islamic symbols.Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Washington who is an expert on Xinjiang, said China’s Communist Party saw Islamic culture and Arabic as foreign influences outside of its control.“It is also seen as connected to international forms of piety, or in the eyes of state authorities, religious extremism. They want Islam in China to operate primarily through Chinese language,” he said.Uighur Muslim woman tells Congressional-Executive Commission on China she asked Chinese to kill her whilst in detention campZha Xi, from China’s National Erthnic Affairs Commission, would only say the constitution protected the rights of all minority groups and insisted halal regulation was handled by Beijing’s local government.But the Beijing council’s committee on ethnicity and religious affairs also declined to comment, saying there was a national directive on halal restaurants.The expunging of Arabic and Islamic signs marks one of the softer parts of China’s attack on Islam.Human rights groups and the UN have decried the large camps set up in Xinjiang as equivalent to “wartime concentration camps”.Former detainees have spoken of Muslim Uighurs inside he camps being forced to denounce Islam, swear loyalty to the Communist Party and even eat pork or drink alcohol – both forbidden by their religion.The government maintains it is simply attempting to combat Islamic extremist terrorism in Xinjiang.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I see on it people I once admired behave in a way that erases nearly all respect.Intelligent iniduals make comments they would regretthey had been texts to friends, let alone messages to the whole world.People who once seemed judicious in their judgements behave — at best — like scolds, desperately attempting to ­correct the world for not ­holding precisely the same views as themselves.Yet Twitter has the ability to ­highlight at speed problems only ­noticeable at a slower RPM in the real world.One is the uncomfortable, ever-vanishing line between comment and journalism.While this blurring is not completely new, there was a fine example last week.As news of Boris Johnson’s successful Conservative Party election victory broke, Lewis Goodall — Sky’s political correspondent — tweeted a photo of a television autocue with the caption: “So great to share a set with Black Mirror today.”For those unfamiliar with it, Black Mirror is a Netflix series created by the formerjournalist Charlie Brooker featuring ious dystopian fantasy futures.There is not very much for Goodall or anyone  to gain from this observation.It is possible some people saw it and gave a snort of appreciation.Perhaps somebody somewhere actually laughed. But it is unlikely anyone is still roaring, days later, at the brilliance and perceptiveness of the observation.Like most things on social media, the short-term gain is not worth the cost. For a cost there is, paid in public trust evennot by the tweeter.If broadcasters still cared about the editorial independence of their employees, comments like this would not be made by their journalists.For they further reveal what most of the public has come to suspect — that broadcasters presenting themselves as non-partisan in fact hold very clear political views and that these usually veer in a particular direction.Most, for instance, tend not to be enthusiastic Leave voters who secretly admire Prime Minister Boris Johnson and occasionally let this truth slip. Of course, people have always harboured their suspicions.But not until journalists began to freely give away their thoughts on social media was there such a smorgasbord of evidence.For years, Gavin Esler was the apparently impartial presenter of many leading BBC political shows, including Newsnight, holding people to account whatever his own views.This was back when we viewers did not have access to a presenter’s opinions.Instead, we would have to guess from throwaway remarks or how one interview compared with another.After the Brexit vote, however, it became clear that Esler had strong views about British membership of the EU.Then, this April, he announced his membership and candidacy for the pro-Remain party Change UK.In a speech at its launch and in subsequent media appearances, he turned out to be as partial as it was possible to be.Indeed, some of his political interventions could legitimately be described as “foam-flecked”.Are the public to pretend Gavin Esler pre- was a dferent beast from the Gavin Esler of this year Or do we presume he always held certain views and only broke out when there was a chance to express them while standing — as it turned out, unsuccessfully — as a candidate for the European Parliament By following broadcasters on Twitter, particularly from the BBC and Sky, it is clear to see the barrier is eroding for everyone.When Goodall sent his Black Mirror tweet, the journalist Tim Montgomerie tweeted: “Throughout Sky News we have pundits posing as reporters. Neither Sky execs nor Ofcom seem to give a damn.”In response, Goodall’s Sky News colleague Kay Burley went for Montgomerie herself, tweeting: “You’re an absolute disgrace to our profession. Seriously.”It was, as Montgomerie went on to say, a pretty unprofessional response in itself.But he was right. There is something strange about this whole game.Partly it is so eroding to public trust because it all goes in one direction.On one single occasion in recent years has a television presenter let slip a view that did not fall into lockstep with the narrow orthodoxies of the broadcasting class.When ­Politics Live presenter Andrew Neil sent out one tweet last year mocking the increasingly conspiratorial Observer writer Carole Cadwalladr, he deleted the tweet and himself became a news story.There were swt calls for his sacking and the BBC felt compelled to publicly chastise Neil.Though widely considered the country’s leading ­political interviewer, Neil no longer has a regular slot on the BBC.The incident stands out partly because it is so unusual for a broadcaster not to go in one predictable direction, but also because it was clear that a price must only be paid when the opinions are the “wrong” ones.The breaking of the “fourth wall” — which meant impartial broadcasters refrained from veering into personal political expression — has had a damaging effect on broadcast journalism.Just observing what a broadcaster like Emily Maitlis chooses to retweet tells me more than I want to know about her own political views.These retweets go in the usual direction, and it bothers me not a jot where those views dfer from my own.The trouble is they begin to colour the rest of the work.When Rod Liddle appeared on Newsnight and was roundly harangued and insulted by Maitlis, I did not think: “What a tough interview.”Having seen what Maitlis had tweeted and retweeted in recent months, I simply saw the same views played out in the Newsnight studio.There was no mystery, no separation between impartial interviewer and opinionated tweeter.Will this have an impact  My guess is it already has.And when the broadcast media complains about disappearing trust in their profession, remember — they have only themselves to blame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was clear he had never suffered the injuries he would have suffered had he really been subjected to the acts he claimed had been committed against him.He had never been absent from home or school at the time he claimed he had been abused.Moreover, there was no trace of the two children who Beech claimed had been killed by the supposed paedophile gang.Surely these are the first checks which should have been made before police started raiding the homes of suspects.If there is no sign that the murder “victims” had ever existed, that should have set a very loud alarm bell ringing in the ears of police investigators.Yet on they ploughed, driven by the perverse doctrine that anyone who alleges that they have been a victim of sex abuse must automatically be assumed to be telling the truth.That doctrine was a magnet for fantasists such as Nick, who gain a thrill from putting innocent people through the mill — and who stand to pocket a fortune in compensation.Why on Earth was Beech paid £, by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board before his allegations had been tested in court The top brass of that organisation need to hang their heads in shame.Many people are going to be asking: Just how much more taxpayers’ money has been merrily handed out to “victims” who have been telling fibs Sir Richard has demanded a criminal investigation into the Met decision to raid suspects’ homes without proper evidence.But even without that element of the story, it is a disgrace that no police officer has been investigated for misconduct.Instead, those in charge of the investigation have been rewarded. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway was promoted to superintendent while under investigation for alleged misconduct in the case, and retired just before Beech’s trial.Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald — who infamously described “Nick’s” allegations as “credible and true” — also retired on a gold-plated pension before the Beech trial began.Ex-Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who oversaw Operation Midland, has been booted upstairs to a plum, £,-a-year job at the National Crime Agency.Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has been rewarded with a peerage. What an utter farce his elevation makes of the honours system.Sir Richard said the Met has “sought to protect itself from effective outside scrutiny” over Operation Midland, and claims that during an investigation he oversaw into the operation in , the Met failed to pass on all the relevant documentation.He added: “I remain unable to conclude that every officer acted with due diligence and in good faith.”But most contemptible of all, in a way, is the behaviour of Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson.Without Watson, it is unlikely that Beech’s allegations would have been taken so seriously.It was Watson who invited Beech to his Westminster office, who stoked the political heat and put the pressure on police to take Beech’s allegations far more seriously than they deserved.And what has been his reaction since Beech was found guilty last week  Not to apologise but to claim, preposterously, that he, too, was a victim of Beech’s. Rubbish, Mr Watson.You seized on “Nick’s” allegations because you could see the political dynamite of a case which involved a former Conservative Prime Minister, Edward Heath, and ex-Home Secretary, Leon Brittan.The main victims of Beech are, of course, the men he ly accused of forming a paedophile ring, but we should not forget another class of victims — those genuinely abused and who now might be shy of reporting the crimes against them for fear of being taken to be another Beech.That is part of the long trail of destruction caused by the fantasist.

Where do we draw the line with boundaries  We’re going to raise cold and emotionless children.My father recently passed away andhe hadnt felt comfortable hugging my child and passed away not feeling close to his grandchildren, I would have been devastated.Jane then fired back, saying: This is a major crisis, it’s about everyone - not just families - hence the me too movement. Most children are abused by children they know. You just need to give a heads up to what you are doing.Its more important with children as their brain development is rapid and they need to be taught boundaries early on. It’s basic respect, not sexual.Rebecca then said: With families no, with strangers yes. We’re making a robotic society. We need to teach kids love and affection.The discussion sparked a major Twitter debate, as many social media users slammed the snowflake generation as ridiculous.A Twitter poll run by This Morning showed that  per cent disagreed with grandparents being told to ask children for permission before kissing them.One Twitter user said: It’s OCD gone mad. Teach them that it’s ok to say no, but those who you’re close to, be it family or friends are important enough to give a hug to. Grandparents won’t be around forever and are the greatest source of what family is!Another wrote: Omg utterly ridiculous! What is this woman thinking. We’re British...it’s standard. Hug Grandma, Hug Grandad....get the kettle on, where’s the cake While another tweeted: Dear lord. This is getting out of hand now. I wish i still had my grandparents around to hug.However other Twitter users were quick to say that they agree with the parenting expert.One person said: Consent is an important concept and children should have the choice. Autonomy and trust is far more important than tradition.Another added: My mum always does ask my  year old daughter...“can nanny have a kiss” then it’s up to my daughter, most of the time she gives a kiss, but there’s the odd occasion she turns away...

who is estimated to have impregnated over , dferent women in his letime.Historians say one of the key reasons he had so many offspring is that he wanted to keep his legacy alive forever.Multiple sources told the US  paper that convicted paedophile Epstein - currently in jail facing child trafficking charges - would boast of his sick baby making plans at champagne-fuelled parties.The shamed financier apparently began sharing his vision for his ,sq ft Zorro Ranch near Santa Fe in the early s.He would allegedly tell scientists and businessmen he wanted the vast New Mexico property to be turned into his own personal baby-making factory.There, women would be inseminated with his sperm and give birth to his babies, two top scientists and a leading business adviser told the Times.He died in  at the age of  during a battle with the Chinese kingdom Xi Xia.Under Khan, the ruthless Mongol army aggressively expanded throughout Asia.Tactics employed by Khan and his army were notoriously brutal.Each time a new city was conquered hug segments of the population were slaughtered.The survivors were subjected to pillage, torture and rape.Some were used as human shields in front of the Mongol army during subsequent attacks.After conquering a territory, Genghis Khan would get the first pick of women to add to his harem.Some estimates suggest he impregnated over , dferent women. It was not clearEpsteins stranger-than-fiction dream would involve him having sex with the women or them being articially inseminated.Epstein told of the plot at least twice -

You know, when you just survive.”Simon Greave, Labour leader in Bassetlaw, Notts, one of the communities the report focused on, said people were fed up and beyond frustrated with Westminsters dilly-dallying over Brexit.He said people in his town wanted the whistle blown on game-playing with Brussels so Britains big domestic issues could be tackled.He told The Sun: People knew what they were voting for.The fact that some decision-makers don’t want to listen is a Westminster problem, not one created by local people in Worksop.The fact is that in Worksopcrime is lower, deprivation is lower and unemployment is lower.Comparisons like this mean nothing though when you’re working all hours to make ends meet, without access to affordable childcare and support for your family.People don’t want hand outs, we want the opportunities we are entitled to, with the chance of better paid more secure jobs for themselves and their children.”Both the Tories and Labour have highlighted that small towns will be the battleground for the next election.Boris promised a substantial cash splurge and Labour hired an award-winning director to make a three-minute film to show its commitment to small towns last year.Ben Bradley, the MP for Mansfield, is delighted Boris has put towns and cities at the heart of his Government already.He told The Sun: I’ve been really pleased that Boris has put the regions and post industrial towns like Mansfield at the centre of his policy agenda.But many in small towns feel left behind and “disillusioned” with the Westminster machine.They feel like politicians don’t care about areas outside of London and communities that once thrived have been left to fend for themselves.One man, from Newport, South Wales, said: Westminster and the government are London-centric, and the further west, east, north you go, you know, the poorer things are.Towns close to Britains biggest cities were losing out twice, according to the JRF, as they fight both London and their nearest neighbour for investment and funding.A woman from Bolton, a town  miles from Manchester, which voted  per cent to Leave, said: I think what we could call traditional working class areas, theyre declined to the benefit of richer areas where people want to invest money - rather than actually investing it areas where it would make a dference to local le.Another woman from Middlesbrough, a city where  per cent voted Leave, said: “We’ve been sort of left in this area.”While big businesses flock to Britain’s cities like London, Manchester and Birmingham – small cities and towns are left to pick off the scraps.“It’s all low paid jobs, so to be able to bring up the area in general, we need people with higher paid jobs, she said.“They need to be more companies to be brought in that aren’t just distribution centres so we need incentives.”Boris has promised to inject cash for improved transport, housing and leisure facilities to reverse decades of decline and neglect in Britain’s towns.Up to  forgotten towns will get a share of the fund under a drive to unite and “level up” the country.He vowed to create a new “golden age” for Britain and declared: “We’re going to put proper money into places that need it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit spending officially","story":"NewsNo Deal Brexit spending officially tops £bn as Boris Johnson confirms huge new fundThe Government has announced they are spending another £.billion in case of no dealShareByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPlans to prevent chaosBoris Johnson leaves the EU without a deal on Halloween will cost another £.billion, the Chancellor announced. The new figure includes plans to stop the UK running out of food and medicine. It is by far the largest spending commitment made since Mr Johnson came to power, bringing government spending on Brexit preparations to £.billion. Labour ’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell branded it an “appalling waste of tax-payers’ cash, all for the sake of Boris Johnson ’s drive towards a totally avoidable No Deal.” He added: “This government could have ruled out No Deal, and spent these billions on our schools, hospitals, and people.    And GMB boss Tim Roache said : “It’s needless, and it’s based on Tory Party isions not the needs of working people. “ The Treasury has earmarked £ million to spend preparing the UK Border for the chaos of a no-deal Brexit, including  extra Border Force officials. And cash will be spent improving transport infrastructure around the Kent coast to deal with massive tailbacks at Dover. The Government will spend a further £ million to ensure the supply of vital medicinestrade routes break down. And more than £ million will be spent on an ad campaign to encourage Brits to prepare for the worst-case Brexit scenario. Some £. billion of the cash will be available immediately - with a further £ billion available for Government departments to bid on as necessary.    Number  insiders now believe leaving without a deal is the most likely outcome, despite Boris Johnson saying publicly it was a “million to one” just days ago. Mr Javid said: “With  days until the UK leaves the European Union it’s vital that we intensy our planning to ensure we are ready. “We want to get a good deal that abolishes the anti-democratic backstop. Butwe can’t get a good deal, we’ll have to leave without one. This additional £. billion will ensure we are ready to leave on  October - deal or no deal.” Best for Britain CEO Naomi Smith said: “This is a colossal waste of money for something both Parliament and the country don’t want. “We know a no-deal Brexit will mean shortages of foods and medicines, and we know it’ll cost the country a fortune. Now the new Chancellor wants to throw billions more at the problem his government is responsible for creating. “Wasting money like this when we have so many other priorities is exactly why the country has turned against Brexit. We need to stop fixating on it so that we can fix the country.”  GMB General Secretary Tim Roache warned Brexit will make things far worse for working people unless Boris Johnson stops fixating on our departure from the EU and tackles their “real le” concerns. Writing for the Mirror, he said: “If politicians do not address the everyday worries of large swathes of the public – orthe outcome of Brexit is to makes things far worse and not better for working people then that lead to a want to tear down the status quo.” “The last PM didn’t learn that lesson,” Mr Roache added. “And the current one couldn’t figure it outit smacked him over the head.” It comes after Boris Johnson reaffirmed his commitment to leaving the EU on October  “come what may” during a meeting with political leaders in Northern Ireland. A Number  spokesman said: “He said that in all scenarios, the government is steadfast in its commitment to the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement and that in no circumstances would there be physical checks or infrastructure on the border.” The Prime Minister faced a third day of jeers and protests as his tour of the UK’s regions landed in Stormont for talks aimed at restoring power sharing.    The PM promised to be “impartial” in the talks, despite enjoying a cosy dinner with leaders of the hard-line Democratic Unionist Partythe night before. On Tuesday night, the Prime Minister dined with DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds, to discuss renewing the grubby pact Theresa May hatched with their party to prop up her fragile grip on Parliament.    Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance, all supporters of Theresa May’s ill-fated Withdrawal Agreement and the contentious border backstop, warned Mr Johnson of the potentially damaging consequences for the regionthe UK leaves the EU without a deal. The Ulster Unionists, which campaigned for Remain in  but now want to see Brexit delivered, also cautioned the Prime Minister against a no-deal. The DUP again insisted they wanted to see a “sensible” Brexit deal, but said it would be foolish to take no-deal off the negotiating table.

Teddy Hemingway was snfling during the school run with his older brother and sister, but his mum Lauren didnapost realise anything was seriously wrong until he spat out blood. The cold had given Teddy a nosebleed, which made him choke, stop breathing, and then go into cardiac arrest, when he was just four weeks old. His skin turned grey and his lips went blue while he was in his -year-old mumaposs arms, and she frantically ran into the school reception for help. Quick-thinking staff snapped into action and along with paramedics performed CPR for  minutes before little Teddyaposs throat was cleared and his heart restarted.    Parents Adam, , and Lauren, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, said doctors warned he may still have suffered brain damage, which wonapost become apparent until years to come. But now nearly  months old, Teddy is happy and thriving and his mum is speaking out to urge others to learn basic le saving skills. Stay-at-home mum Lauren said: I remember them laying him forward and the blood just pouring from his mouth. I remember seeing his lips go blue and his face grey. I kept askinghe was breathing and no one was answering me. Then he was laid on the floor, and two of the staff were giving him CPR as he wasn’t breathing - and they couldn’t find a pulse. The ambulance crew turned up and suctioned the blood and mucus from his throat and he started to breathe again.    I think a lot of parents donapost realise what a simple cold can do to such young babies. I didnapost know infant CPR, andit hadnapost been for the school staff, and their quick-thinking, we might not have had the outcome we do now. His mum Lauren was dropping Ashton, , and Daisy, seven, at Norristhorpe Junior and Infant School on October , when disaster struck. Teddy, who was four weeks old to the day and had a cold, started to cry and was given his dummy, before Lauren noticed he was blowing lots of bubbles and gasping for air. I thought that was wind or mucus as he had quite a bad cold, she said. I got him out of the car seat and put him over my shoulder to wind him. As I pulled him back I noticed a streak of blood in his spit on his lips. Then he just started to spit out pure blood.    She added: I ran to the school office and told them I didn’t know what was happening to him and couldn’t seeheaposd cut his lip on my coat when I’d put him over my shoulder, she said. The school called , an admin worker took the motionless tot from her arms and put him on the floor, as two staff performed rescue breaths and chest compressions. The reception lady told me she was calling an ambulance regardless - though from then it’s all a bit of a blur to be honest, she said. We were blue lighted to the nearest children’s specialist hospital and had a team of doctors and specialists waiting for us when we got there.She added: Obviously we were relieved to know that it wasn’t a serious medical condition, but also very unnerved that it was something so minor that very nearly cost him his le. Doctors at Leeds Childrenaposs Hospital told Lauren that Teddy had had inflamed nasal passages due to his cold. Dried mucus gave him a nose bleed, which caused him to choke, go into respiratory arrest, then cardiac arrest, his mum said.

And while the issue has been praised for the way it highlights important issues, it has already faced some harsh criticism.Meghan came under fire earlier this week from the likes of Piers Morgan who branded her a publicity-craving celebrity for taking on the role.But now sheaposs coming under scrutiny for a very dferent reason.    Many, including Cosmopolitan and MailOnline, are speculating that the -year-old let slip that she broke a royal tradition while guest-editing Vogue.This is because of a sentence included in her editor letter for the issue, which seems to suggest that she and Prince Harry knew the sex of their baby before he was born.While introducing the content in the magazine, Meghan wrote: I was about five months pregnant when this process began, and by the time you hold this issue in your hands, my husband and I will be holding our three-month-old baby boy in ours. Traditionally royal couples have opted not find out whether they are having a boy or a girl until the birth - though this is not a rule the Queen enforces.    Meghan and Harry welcomed baby Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor on May  and maintained throughout the pregnancy that they wanted to keep their childaposs gender a surprise. But the mention of a baby boy in the editoraposs letter, makes it seem like this might not have been the case. Of course, it is not known precisely when the Duchess penned the letter, but she did reveal that she first began working with Edward in January - four months, before the birth of Archie. It is also possible that her piece could have been edited before publication to include this detail.  Back in January, people who met Meghan during a visit to Birkenhead, claimed she had told them she and Harry had chosen not to find out the sex of the baby so they could keep it a surprise. However over the next few months there were several moments when royal fans questioned whether the couple already knew the gender. For example, when Meghan flew to New York for her lavish baby shower, her former Suits co-star Abigail Spencer arrived with a blue gt bag, full of blue tissue paper. Moreover the Duchess opted to wear the colour blue many times during her pregnancy and used the colour in all of the branding for the SussexRoyal official Instagram account.Vogueaposs September issue is set to hit newsstands on Friday, August ."},{"url":null,"title":"nurses twin boys left lifelong","story":"NewsNurses twin boys left with lelong brain damage after traumatic early birthStephanie Atkinson, , gave birth to her \"little treasures\" Herbie and Henry after being rushed to hospital and sent for an emergency cesarean at  weeksShareCommentsByAnna Riley:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsStephanie Atkinson with her twin sons Herbie and Henry, who were diagnosed with diplegic cerebral palsy \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA nurse has told how her twin boys were left with lelong brain damage after suffering a traumatic premature birth.

The twins were born at  weeks after a aposcomplicatedapos delivery which left them both with brain damage. As Herbie and Henry grew, Stephanie noticed her sons, now six, werenapost reaching the same development milestones as other children. Eventually, they were both born with diplegic cerebral palsy. The condition affects the boysapos movement, and they both need to use wheelchairs to get around. Herbie has also been operated on to try and improve his mobility, reports Hull Live.    When they were both born, I had a emergency c section due to both boys being breech and dropping of heart rates, which was very traumatic and they came quite early at  weeks and spent eight weeks being cared for in Hull Royal Infirmaryaposs neonatal intensive care unit, said Mrs Atkinson, who works part time as a nurse. As they were growing up, I noticed at first that Herbie was late in meeting his developmental milestones such as walking, crawling and sitting, and at the age of one he couldnapost sit up properly when he should have been able to. My sons are both six years old now, but Henry wasnapost diagnosed until last year, and Herbie was three when he was diagnosed. The boys being premature, delivery and post birth complications caused brain damage, all of which lead the the diagnosis of diplegic cerebral palsy, which prevents normal development of motor . It came as a shock as we werenapost expecting it, but weaposve had a brilliant professional team of consultants around us that have helped so much.    Both the boys use wheelchairs, and Herbie also has leg splints and walking aids to get around. They go from dferent levels of mobility from walking to needing to be in the wheelchair all day, as their bodies have to work twice as hard as ours do. They can get frustrated and upset because they canapost do the things they want to do. Itaposs heartbreaking at times but the boys just get on with it and we take each day as it comes. Herbie and Henry are both little treasures, and anyone that meets them falls in love with them as they are very happy, outgoing and caring, and really just like normal little boys. They are beautul and we are lucky to have them. It is uncertain what the future holds for Herbie and Henry in terms of their condition and Mrs Atkinson says they just take every day as it comes but that every growth spurt takes them back a bit. She and her husband David hope that with the help of the hospital and physiotherapy, their sons will be able to live le to the fullest and the family are closely supported by their friends and family.

The new owner wonapost be allowed to put up a new home, however, as development of any kind is strictly banned.    The island enjoys the highest category of environmental protection thanks to a deal struck between previous owners and Scottish National Heritage. Owners are expected to manage and conserve its special features, due to it being a Site of Special Scientic Interest.The island is on sale for the first time in two decades since the Buchanan family estate were forced to sell the land to pay off debts after Lady Leith-Buchanan died in .Also known as Tree Island, Creinch is located within the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, north-west of Glasgow.  It is the third in a chain of four islands, the others being Inchcailloch, Torrinch and Inchmurrin.

The ground is carpeted with wild hyacinths, wood anemones, a type of flower and wild garlic and has Oak, Alder and Scots Pine trees as well making it dficult to enter during the summer months.Recorded history suggests Creinch has never been inhabited by humans, but there have been suggestions that its size and position would make it a secure refuge for early peoples.The Loch Lomand islands are said to be perfect examples of how Scotlandaposs scenery may have developed without the interference of man.

She feels she was too young to handle the pressure and wants to stop other kids going through the same hell.  Single mum-of-three Callie is now earning just £, a year as a carer and living in a £-a-month rented home. And she insisted: “I am the happiest I have ever been.” But she revealed how after her win she lavished hundreds of thousands of pounds on family and friends, endured abuse by total strangers and was beaten up by two jealous women. And she said she is still owed £, by “fake pals” who took her debit card to buy Macbooks and gts for themselves as she partied at the height of her fame. Callie welcomed a government consultation on the lottery gambling age and joined the campaign to raise it. It comes amid mounting fears over the potential impact of gambling addiction on children’s mental health.    She said: “People still ask me about the lottery win all the time. “You are only a , with all that responsibility. At that age, you can get the best advice ever. “But you are not in a position to listen. I was too young. Overnight I went from carefree child to adult. All these years on, it still gets dragged up. “Even when I go for job interviews, I am thinking about it. I suffer from such bad anxiety when I am going to meet new people. It preys on my mind, what a new partner’s family will think of me, or even new friends. I still get abuse just because of who I am.” Callie recalled how when she was told she had scooped the jackpot on June , , making her Britain’s youngest lotto winner at  years and three months, she thought even then it was “too much” money. She was earning £. an hour as a Co-op shop assistant in her home town of ­Workington, Cumbria.  Callie, whose dad Jeff, , recently died of cancer, said: “I did not want that much money. I was in foster care and for the first time in a long time, I was really settled and really happy. When they told me it was a £million jackpot, I thought, ‘I don’t want that much.’ In the end it was shared out and I got £.million, but even then it was hard to take in. “At  you do not know what is ahead of you, because by God I did not expect any of that. I asked the Co-opI could have my old job back.” But Callie moved out and bought her first house at  with then boyfriend Nicky Lawson, the dad of her eldest ­children Kian, , and -year-old Debony. Callie, who also had a son, Blake, seven, and daughter Georgia, three, with fireman Paul Penny, splashed the cash on holidays, cars and presents.    She added: “I would give money to distant relatives and friends of friends. I loaned £, here, £, there. I would never get it back. “People asked for money for new cars and I would help out. I was a soft touch. Now I realise what they were like. I was exploited because of my age. I had a lot of fake relationships.” At age  things took a sinister twist after she and Nicky had a dficult time. Callie tried to kill herself and her children were taken from her. She spent £, on boob jobs to boost her self confidence. But Callie denies she spent £, on cocaine. She said: “Put simply, someone  was going to sell a story on me. “It was put to me that I might as well talk about it. So many people made money from selling fake stories. So I agreed to talk. I know that I was far from perfect. I did what ­teenagers do and I went out and had parties. “But I have never ever been a druggie or blown a load of money on cocaine.” Callie advises any young winners to keep their fortune secret. She said: “The publicity was the hardest part for me because of my b­ackground.

Poynton in Cheshire was amongst the worst hit places with the fire service declaring a major incident and rescuing  people. Cheshire Fire and Rescue Servicesaid firefighters, emergency services personnel and staff from Highways England were helping those affected, with a rest centre established at the local civic hall. Rescuers have been working through the night to help people in the worst flood-hit areas. It follows a day of flood chaos across the country with bridges destroyed and roads turned into impassable rivers. In Poynton, police urged people not to ignore road closed signs by driving or walking through water.Have you been affected by the floods  Email webnews@mirror   Poynton Fire Station said its crews had been to more than  incidents, including rescuing at least  people from flood water in the area over a four-hour stretch. Police in nearby Wilmslow also said its officers were dealing with flooding and had evacuated affected residents, with Oakenclough Childrenaposs Centre open as a rest centre. The Environment Agency put out multiple flood warnings and alerts covering central, north-west and north-east England on Wednesday.  On Thursday, Northern rail said flooding had disrupted all lines of the railway between Manchester Airport and Wilmslow. Yesterday, the Army was called in to help in North Yorkshire, where a bridge on Grinton Moor, which featured in the opening stage of the  Tour de France, was wrecked. Soldiers from  Yorks laid sandbags for residents in the village of Grinton, where .in of rain had fallen in just two hours. The Yorkshire Dales, the Midlands and Lancashire were among the worst affected areas, but flood warnings were out for Cheshire, Derbyshire, Notts, Co Durham and Scotland last night. In North Yorks, landlady Rowena Hutchinson, , said rain came in “like a waterfall”, at the Red Lion Inn in Langthwaite, Richmond, leaving her up to her chin in water.    She said: “The water just rushed in from the back. It rushed through, and slammed the front door shut and then it rose up to about ft. “I slipped and went under up to my chin, and then managed to grab hold of a bench and pull myself out, but the force of water and speed was just unbelievable.” She managed to get upstairs and called for help from a window. A fireman later carried her out on his back. The pub, in her family for  years, is unlikely to reopen until after Christmas.  Rowena said: “It’s completely smashed, doors off, and a wall has gone. The speed and force of the water was unbelievable.” Major routes were turned “into rivers” and left impassable in what police described as “shocking” travel conditions. It was the picturesque towns and villages of the Yorkshire Dales which were worst hit. Steve Clough, of Swaledale Mountain Rescue, said: “The roads were a raging torrent and there were sheds and household oil tanks floating down them.    “Some homes had a metre of water in them – it was horric.” His team spent more than eight hours searching properties, rescuing about  people. Firemen went to  flooded homes in the area. The fire station in Leyburn, North Yorks, even flooded while its crews answered emergencies. The Brymor Ice Cream parlour, near Masham, North Yorks, was caught in a freak hailstorm. A spokesman said: “Our parlour suffered damage to the roof, power failures and some visitors suffered minor injuries.” Gareth Walls, from nearby Ripon, tweeted that the hailstones had been “like pickled onions”.  The Ard Rock mountain biking festival, planned for Swaledale this weekend, has been cancelled after the rain left the site devastated. Organiser Alex Rafferty, , said: “The rain just came down off the hills in waterfalls, it blew the riverbanks and has damaged a huge amount of infrastructure, local houses and local businesses.” The storms, which brought , lightning strikes in a day, caused chaos, with parts of a railway line between Kirkby Stephen and Garsdale in Cumbria washed away. Train passengers faced delays after a landslip between Carlisle and Skipton. Customers at Tenpin Bowling in Dudley, West Mids, were evacuated as flooding hit the Black Country.

They are venomous and can cause pain with their bites, but experts say they are reluctant to attack and would rather scamper away when feeling threatened.

It will also keep business rates at a sensible level, at no loss to the council. This will benefit Reform Street and the city centre.”The application by West One, based in the city’s Blinshall Street, is the first by any party to bring the amusement arcade back into use.But the plan comes hot on the heels of a blip in confidence among business owners on Reform Street, who spoken of its “second album syndrome” following a resurgence in food outlets that began with Project Pizza in .The eatery, initially hailed as the shape of things to come, closed without warning last month and the unit is now advertised for let.Proprietors such as Akky Hayat – who runs German Doner Kebab and Fatburger – say punitive business rates are discouraging others from opening shops on the street.Mr Chadwick has not been discouraged. He added: “Footfall is rising and there are positive steps in the regeneration of the area.“The demise of Project Pizza is a minor setback to a street that is on the up.”However, it is hard to ignore the units once home to Victoria Wine, TSB and Swinton Insurance, which have remained conspicuously empty long after they have closed."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/5d012982a59447.83745687.jpg ","title":"a look at dundees performance as curtain raisers over the years ahead of championship opener","story":"Dundee are gearing up for ato the second tier for the first time in six years as they face Dunfermline at East End Park tomorrow night.Victory would set James McPake and his side on their way as they target an immediateto the Premiership.Dark Blues fans, however, should take any result this weekend with a pinch of salt,history is anything to go by.Since the end of the s, Dundee have dropped from the top flight to the second tier five times.Of those, they’ve won two, lost two and drawn one of their opening day contests back in Division One, the First Division or the Championship, depending on what year we’re talking.Strangely it was the ones they lost that preceded ato the top flight at the first time of asking.Here, the Tele trawls through the history books to see how they fared on theirto Scottish football’s second tier:August , Queen of the South - DundeeHaving finished bottom after the exceptional circumstances of the ‘Club ’, John Brown’s Dark Blues came out on the wrong side of a ding-dong battle at Palmerston.Peter MacDonald fired in the opener before the Doonhamers rattled in four goals without reply, ex-Dens striker Derek Lyle among the scorers.Late goals from Declan Gallagher and Iain Davidson weren’t enough to save them a point.However, they would go on to lt the trophy at the end of the season.Final position: stAugust , Dundee - St MirrenRelegated by one point the previous season under Jim Duffy, the Dark Blues got the season off to a good start under the former skipper with a win over eventual champions the Buddies.Bobby Mann nodded in from close range before they were pegged back.Simon Lynch flicked in and Tam McManus sealed the points before a late John Baird consolation at Dens.Duffy would depart not long after with Alan Kernaghan his replacement.A seventh-placed finish would come by May as the Dark Blues endured a disappointingto the First Division.Final position: thAugust , Dundee - St MirrenTheir previous relegation was a whole  years earlier but once more it was St Mirren who headed to Dens Park on opening day.And, again, it was a victory for the home side as George Shaw and Gerry Britton goals gave the Dark Blues three points.Just like in , however, there was noat the first try for Dundee as they finished third, missing out on a play-off place by just two goals to Dunfermline – and the title by just a point to Raith Rovers.Final position: rdAugust , Dundee - Partick ThistleDespite a good record against rivals Dundee United, the Dark Blues once more dropped from the top flight in .

Looking back on last week, the boys put in a good performance.“The away goal’s a cushion for us as well, but we can’t go into the mindset of concentrating on having that. We need to go out and give another strong performance to win the game.“We’re back home, in front of the crowd again, so we want to play with the same tempo and momentum we did against the Finnish team– we got at them, created plenty of chances and we want to get on the front foot quite quickly in the game.“Hopefully we score a couple of goals.”McGinn wasn’t surprised Chikhura were able to compete with Aberdeen.He expects them to come to Pittodrie to sit in, hitting the Dons on the break. But he thinks the Red Army can help see McInnes’ men through to a third round tie against Croatians Rijeka.McGinn said: “You can tell they’ve got a few tactically very good footballers.“Given time on the ball they can punish you.“You’re going to these countries, you maybe don’t know too much about them, but you can guarantee there are good players out there.“From playing on the international stage, I’ve been to all of these countries before and they’re always technically good on the ball.“Last week they caused us problems when we lost the ball. Possession was turned over and they were really good on the counter-attack.“They’ll come here with the same mindset to weather the storm a little bit.“Hopefully the fans can come out in their numbers and create a hostile atmosphere for us.”A near sell-out Pittodrie will be totally dferent to the “strange” situation the Dons faced in Tbilisi, with less than , Chikhura and Reds fans in the , capacity arena.Taylor’s injury after  minutes – diagnosed as a torn hamstring – upset Aberdeen’s attacking rhythm, as Jon Gallagher and then Ryan Hedges were forced to fill in at full-back to allow Andy Considine to fill in at centre-half.Left-back Greg Leigh’stonight will ensure all of the Dons’ attacking talents are free to hurt Chikhura, according to McGinn.He said: “It knocked us a wee bit. We started really well in the game, were getting on the front foot and creating chances.“When Ash went down it was a bit of a blow. We’ve got strength and depth, but when Mikey Devlin gets injured and then Ash, it’s not ideal in the centre-back position.“Andy Considine’s come in. He’s played centre-half on numerous occasions and fitted in comfortably.“We’ve got Greg Leigh back tomorrow night, which will give us back the balance we’re used to and allow our attacking players to get forward and create chances.“We’ve work hard behind the scenes this week on dferent things we’ll try and do in the game.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44345084-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44345084-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44345084-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44345084-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"victory over aberdeen would be treated as major news in georgia","story":"The FC Chikhura Sachkhere manager, Samson Pruidze, says dumping Aberdeen would be the club’s biggest ever scalp in Europe.The Georgians face the Dons at Pittodrie tonight in the Europa League second qualying round.The first leg was drawn - in Tbilisi last week.FC Chikhura Sachkhere knocked out Turkish side Bursaspor in  and Israel’s Beitar Jerusalem last season.Pruidze said overcoming the Reds to set up a tie with HNK Rijeka in the next round would be major news in Georgia.He said: “In the last seven years when promoted to the top ision we have participated in European competition.“We have beaten Bursaspor and beat Beitar Jerusalem last year.“If we can beat Aberdeen it would be a big hit for us. It would be a big, big news for a small team like us,” he said.“When we drew Aberdeen the fans in Georgia knew about the club as it is a big team in Europe.”FC Chikhura Sachkhere made the six-hour, ,- mile journey to Aberdeen on Monday.They had a training session in the Granite City on Tuesday before a session on the Pittodrie pitch last night.Pruidze said: “We are happy to be here in Scotland as you have a big history of football.“Aberdeen is also a famous city for football.“We know we play against a very strong team in their home stadium.“But we have to score the goal. The goal is to score the goal,” he said.“Our team is very good with the ball.“Aberdeen are athletic, move fast, strong and are very dangerous at corner kicks.“We have our plusses too when we play the low ball.”For the first leg in Tbilisi a crowd of only , turned up at the , capacity national stadium.That attendance was only boosted by Chikhura Sachkhere making the match free entry to fans of both teams.A crowd of around , is anticipated at Pittodrie tonight.Pruidze said: “Psychologically we know the spectators come and press their local team because they want to see Aberdeen attacking the other team.“That is normal because they love football here.“The advantage is that Aberdeen have travelled to Finland and then Georgia so have been on the road a long time. So that is a psychological advantage for us.”Meanwhile Giorgi Koripadze, the scorer of the penalty in Tbilisi, believes flying to Scotland four days before kick-off was the right call.Koripadze said: “The decision was the right one from the management because it was time enough to adjust to the climate and environment as it was a long, long way to come here.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"ardrishaig community trust maintains partnership with lochgilphead soccer centre","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMembers of the board of Ardrishaig Community Trust turned out on Saturday July  morning to watch an exhibition game from some of the boys and girls of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre and took the time to formally renew their strategic partnership.Chair of the Trust Hamish Nicol said: #We are delighted to be associated with Lochgilphead Soccer Centre who share our values about a community approach to development.

However, this site is unique in Scotland as it represents a very short snapshot in time.#The flint used by the hunters to make their tools would have been collected in the form of small pebbles from the local beaches but because of the general scarcity of flint in Argyll quartz was also used for less fine tools.Towards the Late Mesolithic, around , years ago another band of hunters set up camp at Succoth near Arrochar. The excavation by Argyll Archaeology, for Dunbritton Housing Association, revealed that in contrast to Lochgoilhead, these hunters probably revisited Succoth over  to  year time span and largely made their tools from quartz, presumably because flint was harder to find at the end of Loch Long.Contact Clare Ellis for further information ellisclare@argyll-archaeology or Torben Bjarke Ballin at lithicsresearch@btinternetPIC:An artists rendering of Argyll#s ancestors making tools. no_aargyllarcheology"},{"url":null,"title":"aliens invade lochgilphead library","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowChildren at Lochgilphead Library had a fun afternoon creating their own alien friends.As part of the LiveArgyll Space Chase to keep young people reading throughout summer, the theme of space travel was expanded upon at a merry little get together, with the children making their own little alien friends out of clay.While they worked, librarian Sylvia Bolwell read them a story of a distant planet where everyone fits in.The youngsters had a lot of fun chipping in with the story and they all had a fun new friend to take home."},{"url":null,"title":"northern jolly for loch fyne anglers","story":"Nikki ThompsonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club couldn’t have asked for better weather for its annual soirée to the fertile fishing grounds of Stornoway.The crossing from Ullapool was as smooth as you like and a sure sign we were in for a good couple of days. Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis.

Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish. Martin Farquhar in the  didn’t have any issues to report with the car and managed first in class in the STRC but second in class on the event and th overall.Event Overall and Class winners: st Overall Alistair Inglis Colin Inglis Lotus Exige ., nd Overall John Rintoul Ross Hynd Ford Fiesta R ., rd Overall Tom Blackwood Gordon Winning Ford Fiesta R+ ..Class  Martin Farquhar Aiden Henderson Peugeot  .Class  Kyle Adam Fiona Moir Ford Escort Mk .Class  Greg Inglis Steven Brown Lotus Exige .Class  Colin Gemmell Richard Crozier Ford Escort Mk .Class  John Rintoul Ross Hynd Ford Fiesta R ."},{"url":null,"title":"shinty report 2 8 19","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMowi PremiershipKilmallie  Inveraray Kilmallie moved two points away from the relegation zone after beating bottom side Inveraray - in their pm throw up at the Canal Parks.Kilmallie’s Innes Blackhall missed out through suspension but Michael Rodger ed to the squad.Inveraray were badly hit by suspension.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this area."},{"url":null,"title":"clive-storey-s-masquerade-takes-supreme-st-boswells-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers Show took place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.The

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more. And I, along with the people of Innerleithen, head safely home after truly enchanting evening."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclists-set-leg-lavender-touch","story":"A CYCLING team which has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity is preparing for its toughest challenge yet.The Over The Hill cyclists are in serious training ahead of their  Border Settlements which will see them complete  miles over three days.The nine-man team - which includes Keith Irvine, Stevie Halls, Sinclair Paterson, Ronnie Murray, Josh Irvine, Kevin Mania, Alan Brown, Doug Welsh and Chris Lightfoot - are tackling the route for the Lavender Touch, a charity which raises funds for people in the Scottish Borders living with cancer.The team have previously cycled  miles from Settle in Yorkshire to Galashiels in aid of Prostate Scotland in , and  miles for the Rowan Boland Memorial Trust in .Stevie Halls said: \"The team, which has an age range of mid-s to over , will be passing through over  towns, villages and hamlets in a journey of  miles across the Borders.\"The route mirrors the geographic reach of the Lavender Touch and although our trip will only last three days, the impact we hope to raise through sponsorship and donations will allow the Lavender Touch to continue to support patients for years to come.\"We will be supported across the Borders by a tour bus which will follow the route and stop off at many towns and villages where the Lavender Touch volunteers will be holding a number of events to promote the charitys work.\"The cyclists head off on Friday, August  and hope to reach Gala Cricket Club before the close of play on until Sunday, August .Local businesses can advertise on the side of tour bus -interested, contact Keith Irvine .Donations can be made to the Over the Hills team at www.lavendertouch project over_the_hill_elite_riders "},{"url":null,"title":"garden-delights-opens-peebles","story":"A NEW community garden in Peebles was officially opened last week.Tesco store manager Tracy Wilson was given the honour of cutting the ribbon at the Gutterbluids Societyrsquos Dovecot Community Garden.A grant from the Tescos Bags for Help scheme along with local donations helped fund the project on land at the junction of Dovecot Road and March Street.Andrew Fraser, secretary of Peebles Gutterbluids Society told us: \"The project would not have been possible without a pound grant received from Tescorsquos Bags of Help Scheme, and the firmrsquos willingness to allow the project to go ahead on their land.\"The pound grant, plus a few generous local donations, paid for the  small, ornamental trees which were required for the garden.\"Tescorsquos local Community Champion, Pauline Weir, was very supportive of the project and was keen that bench-seats should be included in the plans.\"Two bench seats were also donated by local iniduals and have been refurbished, plus two new seats were kindly donated, one by the Rotary Club of Peebles, and the other by private donors.\"Gutterbluids Society members and a few friends planted out the five groves of trees early last December.And each of the saplings was in blossom this spring.As well as its aesthetic appeal the new garden is also benefitting nature.Mr Fraser added: ldquoThe grass in amongst the tree groves has been left deliberately to grow, providing a natural area for pollenating insects, etc, and a surprising number of wild flowers are growing there.\"Our bench-seats are proving popular, - and not only for human use.\"As a result we have had to install lsquopigeon perchesrsquo behind two of the seats, in a bid to stop them perching on the seat backs and defacing them.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"vigilante-leaving-soiled-nappies-bags-dog-poo-bid-keep-youths-woodland-spot","story":"The unusual tactic at the area known as The Jam Pot ndash within Lochend Woods ndash was revealed by police in Dunbar.Constable Gavin Ross said: ldquoSomebody has been disposing lots of bags of dog poo in that area, I think as a deterrent, and used nappies as well, which is not good.ldquoIf the youths are going to go somewhere, which they are, then it is an area we could keep an eye on them.The officer described the area of land, off Kellie Road, and what was happening.He said: ldquoIt is bare ground apart from the fact it is covered in broken glass.

UNICEF Rights Respecting School gold award, which means that it had proved that it incorporates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into the school through both teaching and actions.It now aims to take this further and bring this ethos into the surrounding community.The children were given the chance of addressing the meeting, which included ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell and Neil Gilbert, to ask questions and discuss the best ways to engage young people with what is going on in the community and to ensure their input is noted.The children asked about the plans for the site of the former Cockenzie Power Station and whether more activities for young people such as Rainbows and Scouts could be introduced to the areaWhen addressing the councillors and community councillors, Daniel, a house captain from St Gabrielrsquos, said: ldquoItrsquos important for us at this stage to know what our future is going to hold, and to try and make a dference when and where we can.ldquoTo be involved in the community council in some way would be fantastic, as it would give us comfort to know that the community is being taken care of, as well as what decisions were being made that might affect us.It was decided that the community council would send the agenda for each meeting to the school a few days before the meeting took place so that the children could see it and comment on any issues being raised.The community council said in a statement: ldquoWe would like to thank the four fantastic pupils from St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who attended the community council.ldquoIt was so refreshing to have such polite and knowledgeable young people along to one of our meetings to share their opinions and views on our agenda topics and ask the questions

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

Are the faces staring out from the pages of glossy magazines shining with wellbeing  They might be tanned, toned, and expensively exfoliated, butany of these iniduals has a heart full of joy, it is unlikely to be as a result of their lestyle.In a recent talk, Nicola Sturgeon made an appeal to commonsense, stating what, deep down, most of us already know. She claims that when calibrating a countryrsquos standing and success, gross domestic product is not the most accurate measure. Not least among the misleading factors when using GDP as a guide is that its figures ignore unpaid carersrsquo work, yet put a value on illegal drug consumption. Just as worryingly, says Ms Sturgeon, ldquoIt values activity in the short term that boosts the economy eventhat activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.The First Ministerrsquos laudable aspiration is that ldquothe objective of economic policy should be collective wellbeing ndash how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is. Hoping to establish a fairer and truer scale of assessment, she is collaborating with the prime ministers of New Zealand and Iceland ndash women all, in charge of countries geographically on the fringes, who are prepared to challenge convention.Cynics might, of course, say that Ms Sturgeon is simply laying the groundwork for another independence bid, in which those predicting dire financial consequences will be brushed off as old-fashioned and out of touch by placing too much emphasis on our economic prowess. Yet with Brexit, not just economists but rabid Leavers acknowledge that orce from the EU will cause financial shockwaves. Clearly, this is a risk they think worth running. By the same token, idealists north of the Border, who want us to exit from the UK, often say that the possibility of diminished economic performance after independence would not in itself be a deal breaker. There are bigger issues at stake.That argument is for another day. At this point, were Scotland to become a pioneer in putting a fairer society ahead of a more affluent one, this would represent nothing less than a second enlightenment. The inequalities in health and housing, education and attainment that are nakedly apparent all around us, are shaming for one of the wealthiest countries in the world. No matter how much those at the top make, or how vibrant our financial markets, poverty and desperate hardship for too many people persists. Itrsquos tempting to think that those who see GDP and similar indices as telling the whole story have also embraced the biblical creed that the poor will always be with us ndash in other words, there is nothing we can do about their plight.While the SNP has not been far-sighted or proactive enough to combat the recent shocking rise in drug-related deaths, many of them linked to deprivation and hopelessness, nevertheless Ms Sturgeon and the like-minded leaders with whom she is allied, have a strong social conscience. If the message that money is only part of the equation takes hold, it could potentially prove a turning point for the way all rich societies see, and regulate, themselves.Naturally therersquos a danger when writing disparagingly about high-income earners of appearing either green-eyed or preachy. Despite spending a childhood in the pews, hearing how the widowrsquos mite was as valuable as the millionairersquos cheque, and that those who are hard up today will be blessed with eternal treasures in the hereafter, I nevertheless know that no pair of rose-tinted spectacles can make a terrying bill, an unattainable holiday or too-expensive winter coat, one bit easier to bear. As Mae West put it bluntly: ldquoIrsquove been rich and Irsquove been poor, and rich is better.When it comes to wellbeing, you donrsquot need a carbon monoxide monitor to recognise that the air in Stornoway or St Abbs is far better for us than that in the throbbing financial hearts of Edinburgh or Glasgow, or for that matter Tokyo and New York. Wellbeing consists of something way beyond liquidity, location, or assets. Those in their gated communities, who store their Cartier watches in a vault, have cut themselves off from the rest of society. Is that really enviable  This is not to say they might not be really decent, kind-hearted people who give generously to good causes. Perhaps some of them are. But no matter how open-handed they appear to be, money creates a spiralling gulf between the haves and the have-nots, and sometimes cause rts much closer to home, as family lawyers will attest.Far from solving the problem by capitalistsrsquo pet theory of ldquotrickle-down, too much capital at the top of society actually entrenches inequality. Thus, the endless pursuit of higher incomes, pricier properties, competitive conspicuous consumption, whether at a personal or national level, is intrinsically unhealthy. Once you believe that the GDP graph should show an inexorable year-on-year increase, you become blinkered. This is as true, I suspect, for those running the country as for the inidual.Hunger for amassing hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the power that comes with it, is a recipe for potential disaster. It is psychologically and spiritually corrosive. Slowing the Gradgrind pursuit of ever-greater productivity, focusing on more nourishing and longer-lasting priorities, is a way of calling time on the fallacy that the bottom line is all that matters, and that cash is king. It is a way of taking an ethical stance, and saying enough is enough. How to calculate what constitutes enough, of course ndash be it income, savings, love, leisure, charity, you name it ndash is even harder than measuring happiness.Read more: Scotlands history has lain in the British shadow for too long"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10212492.jpg?type=article-full","title":"dont-miss-fantastic-hidden-gems-throughout-angus-fife","story":"BalbinnyLooking for somewhere luxurious to stay in the Angus countryside  - then look no further than the stunning Balbinny.Situated in rolling farmland between the market towns of Forfar and Brechin, Balbinny benefits from -degree views across the River South Esk towards the Angus Glens, and onto the Cairngorms.A development of luxury self-catering accommodation all with master bedrooms featuring super king sized beds, flat screen televisions and bi-folding glass doors, treat yourself to luxury in the heart of the countryside.Complemented by an award winning swimming pool, spa and fitness suite - make the most of your stay by indulging in one of their therapeutic treatments.Tempted  ndash Grab pound off  nights or more between    -    and quote lsquoHeraldrsquo.Tel Email info@balbinnywww.balbinnywww.balbinny news-and-offerswww.facebook balbinnyInstagram balbinny-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Burntisland Golf ClubDating back to , the original Burntisland Golf Club is officially recognised as the tenth oldest golf club in the world.

I can honestly say we would have no le without him, she says. ldquoI trust him so much when I go out. I depend on him and I trust him.But her assistant is not a home carer or any kind of human support. Kaspa, who  year-old Glenys holds responsible for keeping Ken living in their own home, in Arbroath, is a black labrador. More importantly, he is a dementia dog.Nine years ago Ken Will, who is  was diagnosed with vascular dementia, and le quickly became desperate for Glenys. ldquoKen just wouldnrsquot accept it. He shut himself away and le was terrible, she says.She worked as a lollipop lady, but it increasingly became a struggle. ldquoI didnrsquot want to get up in the morning and in the evening I didnrsquot want to come home, she says. ldquoAnother three or four months and Irsquod have given up.The couple have been married for  years, but it looked as though Ken might have to go into some kind of residential care.ldquoThen we got word of people training dogs to work for people with dementia.

He fetches the post and he brings Kens medicine pouch when it is time to take pills.\" Hersquos Kenrsquos right hand man,\" Glenys adds.The Dementia Dogs scheme was a world first when it was pioneered in Scotland, as a partnership between two charities, Alzheimer Scotland and Dogs for Good, based in Banbury, Oxfordshire. It was initially the brainchild of a group of product design students from Glasgow School of Art.Since Kaspa became on of the first two dogs selected, it has supported  families across Scotland with highly trained assistance dogs to help people living with dementia.The dogs are trained in a iety of specialist tasks, from reminding someone to take their medication, to reducing anxiety and helping build confidence.When someone with dementia is out and about in the community, the dogs act as an icebreaker, helping counter the isolation often experienced by iniduals affected by the condition, and by their carers.The scheme doesnt just benefit dementia sufferers and their families. It was set up in partnership with the open prison Castle Huntly, which houses low risk prisoners nearing release. The prison provides a training room and outdoor space where dogs can be exercised and taught the specialist skills they need to help someone with dementia. Prisoners can sign up to participate and end up with qualications which can help them find jobs when they are released and ultimately mean they are much less likely to reoffend.Now the unique scheme is under threat, with funding coming to an end on August st and a campaign has been launched to raise over pound, to allow it to continue and expand. Although the two charities have pledged to find the funds to make sure families already supplied with dogs continue to be supported, no further families will ge able to benefit.Henry Simmons, Chief Executive of Alzheimer Scotland, said: ldquoWith over , people living with dementia in Scotland, almost every family now knows someone living with the illness. As the scale of dementia rises, we need new and innovative approaches to support people to live in their own homes and communities for longer.ldquoThe Dementia Dog project is a fantastic example of collaborative and pioneering working to develop dferent types of support for people living with dementia and we have been thrilled with its success over the past few years.\"The charities have launched an In the Picture campaign to help raise funds and make sure the option of a dementia dog is still part of the picture for families that could benefit from their support. \"I urge everyone to support to this incredibly important initiative to help make sure that no one faces dementia alone,\" Mr Simmons added."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-revenge-menu","story":"AS performers arrive in Edinburgh for the Fringe, comedian Lucy Porter has a look around town and remarks: \"I see that the Edinburgh restaurant Ive had a grudge against for  yearshas now closed.

Witnesses say they saw a number of gold miners ndash who want to expand their operation into new sections of the Amazon rainforest ndash enter the protected reserve of the Wajapi community and stab their leader to death.This is not an isolated incident, but the latest in a pattern of violence and intimidation. Intimidation that is intensying as a result of Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, and his policy of opening up the Amazon, the lungs of the planet, to further exploitation. The ancestral homes of the indigenous people are to be cleared.:Boris Johnson to chair first Brexit strategy meeting as no deal plans get poundbn boostWill today be the day we reach  degrees  That was the question being asked on news and TV outlets in the UK last week, just as mining assassins had struck down an indigenous leader in the ever more desperate and rapacious pursuit of profit.It is not a great leap to join these two dots. As the UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet said, the mounting violence against indigenous communities is clearing the way for ldquofurther destruction of the rainforest, with all the scientically-established ramications that has for the exacerbation of climate change.As Emryarsquos bloodied body was dumped in a river, a message was being sent. Move off these lands, or die. And with the death of the flourishing of these forests, the climate emergency ratchets up.Bolsonaro is keen to steam roller new tracts of the Amazon. As the director of the Amazon Watch Program, Christian Poirer has said, ldquohis regimersquos reckless policies and its wanton neglect of threatened forest communities is directly linked to rising violent criminality. When he is accused of pursuing mass deforestation, and of covering up for the violence against the peoples living in the Amazon, he simply says it is a lie.But he also wants to disarm criticism ndash in a dictatorial fashion. Since coming to power, he has dismantled government departments who focus on climate change. He has promoted climate change deniers to the highest offices.As soon as he came to power, he signed an executive order that handed the regulation of protected Amazonian lands to the Agricultural Ministry, which is dominated by agri-business interests.Bolsonaro has also displayed a long track record of anti-indigenous sentiment, once commenting: ldquoItrsquos a shame that the Brazilian cavalry wasnrsquot as efficient as the Americans, who exterminated their Indians.The disaster being visited upon Brazilrsquos , indigenous people is a disaster for the world. This is one consequence of the election of Bolsonaro.Last year, I went to Rio and Sao Paulo during the election to speak to activists and to report back to meetings in Scotland on the situation there. I met with campaigners and watched the results come in with hundreds of Fernando Haddad supporters, the candidate up against Bolsonaro. People held on to one another as it became clear, as expected, that Bolsonaro was going to win.:Boris Johnson accused of bias toward DUP on Northern Ireland visitThe very next day, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Sao Paulo and cities across Brazil. In an act of courageous defiance, they made clear they would resist the new regime.I spoke to activists about their plans. ldquoThe initial task is to survive, so we are organising solidarity networks, said one. This response was unsurprising. Attacks against LGBT people were a result of the huge propaganda effort waged by the Bolsonaro campaign.Marrielle Franco, a left-wing councillor in Rio, was shot dead months before. Her face now adorns walls across the city as a reminder of the violence of the forces of reaction in Brazil, as well as resistance unbowed in the face of aggression.I noted two days after the election: ldquoGunmen have attacked an indigenous Bororo village in Mato Grosso do Sul. The attackers destroyed the whole village. This is to clear the way for mining and logging. Clearances for the corporations to move in.Thus, the response from the boardrooms and the ideologues of global capitalism to the election of Bolsonaro was quite dferent from that of the rainforest defenders. The Wall Street Journal backed him to the hilt. He was the choice of the international markets. And more recently, the EU struck a Mercosur trade deal that is catastrophic for the environment. The deal negotiated by the European Commission, has been lauded as historic by Bolsonaro.The deal sees a trade in ldquocows for cars, whereby the EU gains access to markets for cars and other products and services with eliminated export taxes, infor Mercosur countries gaining access to markets for beef, sugar and other goods.Cattle farming is the single biggest contributor to the deforestation of the rain forest. Some  per cent of deforested areas in the Amazon are a result of commercial animal pastures. The deal incentivises the destruction, and it legitimises and entrenches Bolsonarorsquos approach.But that is nothing that wordsmith advocates of corporate globalisation cannot make sound progressive. As the Commissioner for Trade Cecelia Malmstrom put it, the agreement ldquobrings Europe and South America closer together in a spirit of cooperation.This is the internationalism of the neoliberal oligarchy. It is a faux internationalism that exists to perpetuate the elevation of corporate interests over the needs of people and planet.Emrya Wajapi is his name. Found murdered in a river, he and hundreds of thousands like him, are the last line of defence in the Amazon. Ranged against them ndash the violence of men desperate for gold and treasure. A regime that sees them as a pest to be eradicated. And a world system that elevates short-term profit above all .But the rivers are rising.

In this century David Cameron and Theresa May have fronted UK governments that have, unashamedly, put the interests of their party first and protected those with vested interests at the expense of wealth distribution and fairness. With Boris Johnson at the helm there are signs that the doctrine of conscience-free libertarianism will be further emboldened following a No Deal Brexit which will cripple the country and the vast majority of its people but buttress the wealthy both economically and politically.Dominic Cummings, senior adviser to Mr Johnson, very recently said that, in the view of the public, Tories do not care about poor people or the NHS. Whilst this statement could well be another part of his grand election strategy to stimulate debate, it is nonetheless true that societal isions have been accentuated under the Conservatives.Ms Sturgeon has introduced a Benthamite dimension to the national discourse at a time when clarity is most required regarding the nature of our values and what sort of country we wish to live in. She will, almost certainly, come in for criticism from political opponents for hypocrisy or idealism or both.A genuinely Utilitarian society may be a Nirvana in many ways, but it is greatly encouraging that we have a First Minister who possesses the ability to convey her vision, display her humanity and provide sound leadership at this juncture of unprecedented national crisis.The well-being and happiness of Scotland may well rest on her guidance in the weeks and months to come.Owen Kelly, Stirling.THE letter from James Martinis one of the best examples I have encountered of the use of the word hyperbole. We have ldquocringeworthy, whinging, victim persona, suffer, hate-filled, nationalist faces, screaming, foul mouthed, abuse, misappropriated Saltire, intolerant, ignorance, wanton display of boorishness, nationalist, nasty creed. My goodness, what side of bed did Mr Martin arise from that day The cause of this unmerited fury is the performance of Ian Blackford at Westminster and the crowd outside Bute House for the visit of Boris Johnson. I would commend to Mr Martin several viewings on the BBC Parliament channel of Scottish Questions at Westminster, where he will see behaviour from the non-SNP benches to which most of the above words could be applied, so in addition to hyperbole I see hypocrisy.The visit to Bute House by the PM has been well reported and televised by the media and is still available. After several viewings myself, I see an orderly crowd protesting with the booing being louder than the cheering and all in very close proximity to the PM and FM. What were the police thinking about in letting ldquohate-filled nationalists from both sides so close I take particular issue on Mr Martinrsquos comment on the waving of the ldquomisappropriated Saltire. The Saltire cannot be misappropriated by anyone, it is the flag of Scotland and may be used by those who wish to use it. That the SNP and independence supporters use it is perfectly natural. The fact that Scottish Unionists and especially the ldquoProud Scot iety choose not to, is their decision. We hear about Scottish Unionists rooting for Scotland too and so they should, but the Unionist peg is so shoogly they cannot bring themselves to wave the flag of their home country in ldquoour precious Union ndash shame on them.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.I WOULD point out to James Martin that the demonstration in Edinburgh was a peaceful one which left Boris Johnson in no doubt of the strength of feeling regarding Scotlands desire to remain within the EU, and the ultimate horror of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Martin reminds us that the new Prime Minister wasnt \"duly elected other than by a coterie of like-minded iniduals\" but that \"in the UK system the party given the majority chooses who will be PM, not the electorate\". Indeed, but Scotland hasnt chosen a Conservative government since the s, and as Scotland has but  MPs, Wales , Northern Ireland  and England , it is clear that under the UK system everyone gets the governments England elects, and Scotland is facing the unpalatable prospect of leaving the EU because England voted to leave. An affront to democracy which deserves to be protested against.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THE SNP and their apologists tell us on an almost-daily basis that Scotland did not vote for a Conservative government. Figures for the  Holyrood elections and  general elections show that SNP votes were . per cent and . per cent respectively indicating that the majority of Scots voters didnrsquot vote for an SNP Government. They complain that Scots didnrsquot vote for Boris Johnson, conveniently forgetting that Nicola Sturgeon was not voted in by the Scottish voters but simply took over from Alex Salmond when he stepped down after losing the  Independence referendum. The same people tell us that Scotland is being dragged out of the EU against its will. The EU referendum was a UK-wide vote with the result being binding on all parts of the UK. The SNP doesnrsquot accept this.In the  independence referendum  out of  Scottish council areas voted no to independence, so by applying SNP logic it would be reasonable for those council areas voting no in any future referendum to be allowed to remain within the UK. Then again the SNP does not do logic: but it does hypocrisy and cant extremely well.Donald Lewis, Gford, East Lothian.I WONDERit has occurred to Nicola Sturgeon and her party that the reason why they no longer have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and lost so many seats at Westminster is because the Scottish electorate do not agree with their policies, especially that of seeking to break up the UK.Most people are now weary of reading in the newspapers, and hearing on radio and television of the latest rants and moans from Nicola Sturgeon et al.It would not surprise meBoris Johnson found his recent visit to the RN nuclear submarine base at Faslane less grim than that to Bute House.Robert I G Scott, Fe."},{"url":null,"title":"m-middle-class-working-class-roots","story":"The first came from Stacey Dooley, Glitterball winner and documentary maker, the Luton council house girl with no qualications who used to shoplt on Saturdays.

The Scottish Government has been more ambitious and pledged to meet net zero emissions by . This ambition is reinforced in the Scottish Government Climate Change Bill by a target of % reduction in carbon emissions by . So, the challenge for us all is how will we meet these targets Renewables can supply up to % of Scotlandrsquos electricity, but that is just a fraction of our total energy usage.In June , the Royal Society of Edinburgh , Scotlandrsquos National Academy, launched the final report of its major Inquiry into Scotlandrsquos Energy Future. The two-year project had a goal of assessing the pros and cons of the options available to meet Scotlandrsquos energy needs. This allowed a committee of independent experts to take evidence from a wide range of stakeholders including an open call for written evidence, public engagement events across Scotland, and numerous meetings with government, industry and third sector organisations. The report considers Scotlandrsquos current energy landscape, analysis of the future options available to meet energy demand, and the governance of our energy system.The RSE Energy Inquiry report makes a number of recommendations.However, perhaps its most important point is that there is no silver bullet. , Professor Rebecca Lunn , Professor Simon Harley, Professor Gareth Harrison, Professor Gavin Little, Professor Stephen McArthur, Professor Peter Smith, Professor Karen Turner , Professor John Underhill  Professor Janette Webb\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Committee Members, Sir Muir Russell, Professor Rebecca Lunn , Professor Simon Harley, Professor Gareth Harrison, Professor Gavin Little, Professor Stephen McArthur, Professor Peter Smith, Professor Karen Turner , Professor John Underhill  Professor Janette Webb\" class\"editor-image\"Committee Members, Sir Muir Russell, Professor Rebecca Lunn , Professor Simon Harley, Professor Gareth Harrison, Professor Gavin Little, Professor Stephen McArthur, Professor Peter Smith, Professor Karen Turner , Professor John Underhill  Professor Janette WebbThere are no easy answers to the enormous challenge we face. If we cannot signicantly reduce energy demand, which must clearly be a government priority, we may need to double or even treble our low-carbon electricity production. For example, current government policy aims to reduce carbon emissions from transportation by switching to electric vehicles. However, while such a move is certainly necessary, it is not sufficient.The additional electricity required to power our electric cars must somehow be produced, and by low carbon methods .One option to reduce carbon emissions from domestic heating is to convert all our heating systems to run on hydrogen gas. However, based on current technologies, we can only produce sufficient hydrogen by manufacturing it from methane, a process which produces carbon dioxide.Hence, we would still need to invest in technologies for capturing and storing the carbon dioxide. This may prove expensive, so who should pay  Scotland already has a high percentage of households in fuel poverty ndash % in .Read more about our Climate For Change initiative in Business HQ, online every quarterFuture energy policy must consider a wide range of possibilities within the framework of the ldquoenergy quadrilemma ndash climate change, affordability, energy security, and providing energy in a just and sustainable way.Dficult decisions are unavoidable and must be made by our elected officials in a transparent and honest way one which looks at Scotlandrsquos needs, and its social and ethical responsibilities in the round, and decides what the best energy mix should be.The danger of not meeting the challenge head-on is that Scotland, and the wider UK, do not produce enough energy to meet future requirements and rely increasingly on importing energy from overseas. When we import energy, which already accounts for % of UK primary supply, we have no control over its carbon footprint, nor over the ethics, social justice and environmental impacts at the point of its production. We also leave ourselves vulnerable to major geopolitical crises that could result in energy shortages.One of the primary outcomes of the RSE Energy Inquiry is the need to raise the level of informed, evidence-based discussion around energy policy and its impacts. Too often debate on how we source and use energy focuses narrowly on inidual technologies and theirdrawbacks.Public opinion is also influenced by the ldquonot in my back yard problem of not siting production sites near people.As we look to meeting this global challenge, an important facet of ldquodoing things dferently should be to facilitate a wider and more meaningful discussion on why we need energy, how we use it and from where we source it. There will be no perfect or easy solution. Decisions will inevitably have consequences, and signicant financial investment will unquestionably be required, but these realities cannot be allowed to hinder the mature and considered debate that is needed.To this end, a key recommendation of the RSE report is the establishment of an independent expert advisory commission on energy policy and governance. If given the requisite authority and resources, such a commission would provide the Scottish Government, legislators and regulators with integrated and impartial advice. It could also address related areas such as fuel poverty, climate change mitigation, economic development, environmental protection, planning, transport, community development and public health.An independent, credible and trusted body providing this sort of guidance could play a key role in strengthening public and political discourse on energy.Professor Rebecca Lunn is Deputy Chair, Royal Society of Edinburgh Energy Inquiry, University of StrathclydeThe HeraldrsquosClimate for Changeinitiative supports efforts being made by the ScottishGovernmentwith key organisations and campaign partners.

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands.

Orkney’s MSP highlighted the government’s continued failure to find a solution to the islands’ internal ferry services, including replacement vessels, and the lack of progress on implementing RET on external services, a year on from the promised start date. Mr McArthur said: “The National Islands Plan will be important in mapping out the areas where improvements are needed to secure a vibrant future for our island communities.“During the passage of the legislation, I moved amendments making clear that one of the most urgent priorities would be delivering changes and improvements to leline ferry services to meet the needs of people and businesses in Orkney.“This seems to be the message that is coming through loud and clear in the consultation, as demonstrated by the recent response from the NFUS.  It will come as a surprise to no one but should act as a clear signal to ministers that the continued failure to act is unacceptable.“We need a sustainable and long term solution to the funding and operation of our internal ferry services, on which some of our most fragile communities rely. This includes replacement vessels for a fleet that is ageing and no longer fit for purpose.“In addition, more than a year on from the date on which RET was supposed to be introduced, we seem no nearer seeing the reduction in fares.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions.

But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred.

One of the main reasons for applications was that people had spent their benefits or income and run out of money.Everyone has a personal responsibility to live within their means and the state simply cannot afford to fund the lestyles of prodigal citizens who refuse to do so and there is always likely to be a small minority of claimants who try to game the system. But the vast majority of cases will be genuine.: Boris Johnson tries to turn focus from Brexit with pledges to boost northern EnglandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereEver since the  crash, there has been growing concern about in-work poverty with some employers paying below the ‘living wage’ – effectively relying on their staff to claim ‘top-up’ benefits, which could be seen as a form of state subsidy for people’s wages, or get a second or even a third job.The growing discontent about standards of living – not just among the poorest – is a serious problem that must be addressed by politicians of all parties. The failure to do so was undoubtedly one reason for the Brexit referendum result. Boris Johnson’s announcement in Manchester of £. billion for ‘left-behind towns’ may be seen as a populist move, but it was at least a recognition of the need for action. The mere acknowledgement that some places have been “left behind” will be welcomed by many who feel exactly this way.But, ultimately, this is a serious problem that is unlikely to be solved by major spending projects by government – whether at Holyrood or Westminster – but by improving the economic performance of the country as a whole. And governments – at local, Scottish and UK level – have a vital role to play in ensuring this happens and duty to co-operate with each other to this end.So it was disappointing that the immediate reaction to the Welfare Fund figures was an attempt to sht blame. Our politicians need to work together to solve this country’s problems, whether they are ones of high finance or more mundane concerns, like the cost of nappies for an infant.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"what scottish unionists can learn from decline of quebec s separatists murdo fraser","story":"Quebec demonstrates that it is possible for unionists to see off an independence movement evenit seems unstoppable, writes Murdo Fraser.It is always useful to look at international and historical comparisons for the challenges we face in Scotland today. One part of the world that has faced similar constitutional issues to ours is the largely Francophone province of Quebec, which held two referendums on the question of independence , in  and . Whilst on both occasions the vote went against separation, in  it did so by the tightest of margins, with just one per cent between the winning and losing totals.Since , however, the notion of independence for Quebec has slipped down the political agenda, with a collapse in support both for it as a concept, and for the separatist Parti Quebecois.In the most recent provincial election last October, the once-dominant PQ secured just  per cent of the vote, with the winner being the soft-nationalist Coalition Avenir Quebec .What explains this turnaround in little more than  years  Simply, Quebecers tired of the constitutional argument. A younger generation in the province, still proud of their Quebec heritage, became more comfortable with the notion of being Canadian, secure in the view that a strong federal system protected local decision-making.There is little doubt that the constitutional debates had an economic impact. The banking centre of Canada moved from Montreal to Toronto, largely due to concerns over Quebec separation. A legacy of those times is the irony that today the Bank of Montreal is headquartered not in the city whose name it bears, but in English-speaking Toronto.The debate over Quebec’s future had consequences too for the local electoral landscape. With a first-past-the-post voting system, there was little point in the federalist, pro-Canada parties splitting the anti-separatist vote any more than was necessary. : Nicola Sturgeon challenges Boris Johnson to live TV debate on independenceFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereSo the Conservative Party of Canada, despite its electoral successes at a federal level, does not contest elections to the Quebec National Assembly. Instead, Quebec Conservatives vote for the Quebec Liberal Party, which despite its name has been independent of the Canadian Liberals – the party of Justin Trudeau – since , and sits somewhat to their right on economic issues.These arrangements are perhaps best illustrated in the long career of the Quebec politician Jean Charest. Charest started his journey as a Conservative in Canada’s federal Parliament in Ottawa, serving as leader of the party there from  to . Then, on the invitation of the Quebec Liberals, he left the federal Parliament – and the Canada Conservatives – to become the provincial Liberal leader, in which position he went on to be elected as Premier of Quebec. He served in that role from -, winning an unprecedented three election victories.While the notion of dferent political parties at dferent levels might seem unusual to us, it is the norm across Canada. Centre-right, pro-Canada Quebecers have no dficulty in voting one way in a federal election, and quite dferently in a provincial one.So what might we in Scotland learn from all this  Firstly, there is nothing inevitable about independence or constitutional change. It might have seemed to Quebecers in the s that nothing would stop the separatist juggernaut, but the voters simply tired of the constitutional debate.Voter fatigue is something we are becoming familiar with. My sense of where we are with Brexit is that there is a growing demand that politicians “just get it over with”. There is little appetite to re-open the independence question here while the Brexit question is still unresolved, and even then I wonder whether the public will be enthusiastic about yet another round of constitutional debate.Secondly, we should not assume that our current political party structures are either optimal, or set to last for ever. Boris Johnson’s appointment as Prime Minister has reignited the debate over whether there should be a separate Scottish Conservative Party, an idea I put forward in  when I stood for the party leadership .Notwithstanding my views on the issue at that time, to me the notion that we should split from the Conservative Party as a reaction to Boris’s election as UK leader is as daft an idea as the SNP’s claim that this is an argument for independence. The Union has lasted for more than  years, it has been substantially to the benefit of Scotland to have been part of it for that time, both economically and socially, and to dismantle it as a knee-jerk response to the identity of any one holder of the office of Prime Minister, and lose these advantages as a consequence, would be ridiculous.Moreover,Boris can deliver an orderly Brexit, he may well end up governing the UK as a true One-Nation Conservative. A look at his record in office as mayor of London suggests that is entirely possible, and some of his early announcements – for example on dropping his predecessor’s misguided immigration targets – have been warmly welcomed by Scottish Conservatives.I understand the concerns of Conservative colleagues who don’t want to change our relationship with the UK party. I also appreciate that I have MP colleagues who want to be part of a bigger team, and feel that their constituents should have the right to vote directly for the party of Government in a Westminster election. But,we were to adopt a Canadian model of political parties, that would all still be possible. The key battleground ahead for us is  – the Scottish Parliament elections – where a victory for the SNP with a majority of seats at Holyrood for pro-independence parties will lead to them claiming a mandate for a second referendum. The priority for unionists, of all parties, must be to defeat them in that objective.The lesson of politics in Quebec is that when the forces of federalism come together they can see off the threat of separation. If it worked there, it could work here. At least we should be considering whether the Canadian approach is one we can learn from.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"inspirational mum completes 10 000 mile charity trek to australia with no money","story":"A Scottish mum model has completed a , mile charity across the globe to Australia solely relying on the kindness of strangers.Mum-of-two Elaine Harris, , made her way to Sydney - all thanks to kind strangers who helped her get there from the UK.Elaine, who found catwalk success as a finalist on the UKs Top Model, started her epic freebie adventure on a tractor, leaving her home in Forfar, Angus on Sunday, July .She journeyed to Germany, Czechoslovakia, Israel, Bangkok, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Kuala Lumpur before arriving in Sydney - all with no cash.The mum to Salina, six, and Ariana, two, celebrated the end of her -day challenge by climbing up the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge, despite being exhausted.The intrepid catwalk queen has had to survive on one meal a day and protein bars and relied on the generosity of others to get her through the gruelling trip.She had to ration water and the charge on her phone while she bravely hitchhiked for lts on the back of lorries.Elaine said the hardest part was sleep deprivation and a  hour bus journey from Bangkok to Vietnam via Siem Reap, Cambodia.Elaine said: \"When I was starting the challenge I had no idea what to carry.\"How do you pack for somewhere that you dont know \"I took ten protein bars and I ate them all.\"Im so grateful for them, I was having one meal a day and a protein bar.: Scots more charitable than rest of UK \"I had to ration everything.\"I rationed water, food and even the charge on my phone.\"When people gave you food or anything you would just appreciate it.\"I wouldnt ask them to give me stuff but once I got chatting to people they would help but it was all very genuine.\"Some people would give me money for food.\"Hitching for the lorries was terrying.\"My heart was in my mouth but I honestly didnt come across anything negative within the ten days.\"By day three, the whole challenge just blew up and everyone got behind me through social media.\"It was so cool to start at with a tractor in Scotland and end up in Australia.\"The whole journey has been surreal.\": Work of charity leads to £k donation to fight Crohns She travelled from Dundee to Glasgow on the back of a motorbike before hitching a lt with a trucker to Dover where she got the ferry onto Calais.Elaine arrived in Brussels on Tuesday where she hitch-hiked to Lohr Am Main in Baia, Germany.From there she took a -hour bus journey from Bangkok to Vietnam via Siem Reap, Cambodia, where she got a lt on a tuk tuk.She flew from Kuala Lumpur to Syndey.Elaine said: \"The lack of sleep and food was probably the hardest thing for me.\"I was relying on people to feed me because I was in transit the whole entire time.\"I think I went through seven days without having a proper bed to sleep on.\"Elaine took on the challenge to raise funds for a clinic to provide dental and eye care to kids on the isle of Sal, in Cape Verde, off the coast of West Africa.The inspirational mum said: \"I thought about doing something were you take a chance on people being good.\"I felt like most stories that are reported are about the dangers in the world so I thought of something which will show the good in people.\"My kids are really proud of me and my eldest worked in the clinic with me so shes very aware of the work we do.\"Shes full of empathy.

Is it not time you got over it Alas, Ms Sturgeon#sEU policy is vacuous, unsustainable humbug. If Britain stays in the EU, Scotland will automatically leave on Independence Day, creating an immediate “hard border” with the UK . EU tarfs will apply and trade negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster. Our . percent budget deficitexceeds EU limits , implying spending cuts tax hikes of around £ billion per year from a total budget of £- billion.We shall face years of austerity, at the end of which we shall adopt the euro and hand over control of our economy and trade, fishing and agriculture to Brussels. ‘Hasta la vista’, independence!Scots will never vote for that.The obvious antidote is to join EFTA, instead of the EU. But that isn’t the policy being peddled to voters. Ms Sturgeon recently confirmed SNP intentions to rejoin the EU on the BBC#s Andrew Marr Show. The policy is unsustainable humbug and it will change before any independence referendum takes place.The problem is Mr Tulloch is you live in a British mindset when it comes to economics and is very much accepting of the present way of government of Scotland .Proactive governments like Norway, Ireland and Iceland run their government and countries a lot dferent from Westminster and have for example a lot higher g.d.ps or bigger economiesthan we have at the moment, Ireland a hundred years ago was an integral part of the British state ,a rural backwater a neo military junta .Today#s economy an open modern European nation is something to be proud of with a g.d.p of  compared to the U.K  or it#s North east of Ireland of dollars.O the JUSTICE of it.Mr Salmond#s  #Declaration of Lerwick# promised new powers for Shetland.

Responsibility for the management of the Crown Estate’s economic assets in Scotland, and the revenue generated from these assets, will be transferred to the Scottish Parliament. This will include the Crown Estate’s seabed, urban assets, rural estates, mineral and fishing rights, and the Scottish foreshore for which it is responsible.#. Following this transfer, responsibility for the management of those assets will be further devolved to local authority areas such as Orkney, Shetland, Na h-Eilean Siar or other areas who seek such responsibilities…….#Perhaps, Ms Sturgeon will update us on progress, four years on What a great advert for the SNP!!!!# One of the worst education systems according to the international measurement last published.Nicola Sturgeon, albeit unwittingly, chose to wear a Barbour jacket during her brief visit to Shetland.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

The Irish Arts Centre in New York came to see it in the Lyric and there is talk of taking it over to the States for the Irish Arts Festival in February.”Gerard continued: “If people with tickets for the s Night which is happening as part of Féile want to come to the show first, then we wanted to put it out in the Andersonstown News that they can get a ticket half pricethey show their ticket at the door or contact us via sodabreadtheatre@gmail – we can give them a code when booking.“We are really looking forward to bringing the piece to the Devenish and hearing people’s reaction to the work.”A Night in November will be performed at the Devenish Complex on Sunday, August .

They are intent on pursuing a strategy to undermine workers’ pay, terms and conditions as well as imposing price hikes excluding lower income users. There is now a substantial two-tier workforce with increasing numbers of casual workers coming in on poverty pay rates while those previously employed by Belfast City Council are being denied pay uplts, leaving their wages fall ever closer to the legal minimum.“The community has been left behind as well. Last year Unite called a protest against the price hikes and attacks on workers’ pay and conditions on the peaceline which drew signicant cross-community support from both the Shankill and Falls. Working class people are united in their opposition to the council’s austerity-driven policies on leisure services.“Belfast City Council voted to outsource leisure services to this company – they cannot wash their hands of the consequences of that for either the public or their former employees. We call on all parties to reconsider their positions and bring these public services back in-house and give all the GLL workers a decent pay uplt.”A spokesperson for GLL said the company would meet union representatives to “understand the issues they have”.“GLL remains committed to genuine engagement on these matters in the interests of all parties, and to ensure the seamless provision of services across all of our leisure centres,” the spokesperson added.A Belfast City Council spokesperson said: “Belfast City Council is disappointed to learn that strike action is being considered at the city’s leisure centres. Council is committed to working with GLL, its employees and their representatives to ensure the continued provision of leisure services to all our ratepayers across Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"casement park decision due by the end of year","story":"THE long awaited planning decision for the redevelopment of Casement Park is anticipated to be made before the end of this year.

DfC are working on the business case to try and find where that additional money will come from. Once the planning decision has been made it means we won’t be sitting further more years waiting on the business case being drawn up,” he said. Mr Maskey said he would be “very disappointed”the planning decision was not made within the next five months. “In all likelihood, in the absence of a minister, it will be DfI’s Permanent Secretary Katrina Godfrey making the decision.”When asked what would he say to those in the community who think Casement will never be built Mr Maskey said: “We are pushing for Casement to get built – I can understand that people say this will never be done because its been frustrating for so long, it has taken all these years to get the project to this stage. “I think the negavity around the project has reduced over the years. The new design has come in, there has been a lot of hard work done behind the scenes to try and get this major investment for West Belfast through. “The GAA have assured us that all the information needed is all in, that there are no outstanding issues at this stage. “There should be nothing that stalls this project back any further.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"family of joe burns raise over 3000 in","story":"THE family of a popular barman at The Chester have surpassed the £, mark in their fundraising efforts to keep his memory alive.Joe Burns died suddenly five years ago in July , aged just  after collapsing at his parent’s home.Joe was a fit and healthy boxer who trained regularly at the gym.Tragically, the day after his death, his girlfriend Sinead discovered she was pregnant with their daughter Bella who is now four-years-old.Soon after Joe’s death, his family learned Joe’s mum Una and sister Jeanette both carry the faulty gene for Long QT, an inherited condition that can cause heart rhythm disturbances. Left undiagnosed, it can cause sudden death where someone has an unexpected cardiac arrest.Every year since, Joe’s family and friends take part in the annual Belfast Marathon, with all proceeds going towards the British Heart Foundation who use the money to fund research into silent heart conditions.This year,  members of Joe’s family and friends raised £, from their Marathon efforts. Their recent fundraising efforts have brought their overall total since Joe’s death to an amazing £, for the charity.Joe’s sister Jeanette O’Neill said: “This is the third year we have taken part in the Belfast Marathon for the BHF in Joe’s memory. Each year we just keep getting bigger and better with more people from our community getting involved through the full marathon, fun run and relay.“When Joe died our family was absolutely devastated. He was a real character and everyone knew him. He made such a big impact on so many people and it’s amazing that so many of his friends are still so supportive and want to help our fundraising efforts.“We don’t want what happened to our family to happen to any other family so that’s why we fundraise for the BHF because their research into conditions like Long QT are making such a big dference.”Jeanette said they have been overwhelmed by the support from their local community since Joe’s death.“Friends and family have just been fantastic. We are also hugely grateful to the Thunderdome in Glengormley for hosting a buffet for Joe’s runners after the marathon. It gave us a chance to get together after the event and share stories about Joe.

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”. And concluded by saying “it’s time to strike a blow for all workers”.Other members of the audience were afforded an opportunity to speak and one worker, named Amy, said the government does not care about workers standards of living, nor their mental and physical health. She demanded a living wage for all.A motion was put forward by People Before Profit at last month’s full Council meeting calling on the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Finance to provide a “fair and just settlement” which was backed by all councillors.

That included the expansion of Magee and the possibility of an independent university put forward by the DUG.The move followed an intervention by Labour Peer Lord Adonis who convinced the House of Lords to publish a report on the improvement of higher education provision in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a university whose principal campus is in Derry.A spokesperson for the Derry University Group said it is clear that the momentum for a dedicated university for the North West is growing all the time.“In recent months, Derry Strabane Council and other major influencers in Westminster and Dublin have committed themselves to delivering an independent university for the North West.“There has also been huge support from US colleges, who want to partner with a standalone university in Derry.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"powys new head education appointed","story":"Dr Caroline Turner the new chief executive of Powys County Council, takes the heltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtlm on February .lt spangtlt spangt\" POWYS: Has new head of education been appointed Head of education, Dr Alec Clark\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"removing complication","story":"Be more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitBe more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitGet your training off to a great start with this special offer.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"burglary llanidloes see hear anything","story":"Library image of police tape\" Burglary in Llanidloes – did you see or hear anything Library image of police tape\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"re off race life llanfair caereinion   picture special","story":"Caereinion High School pupils and staff took part in the Race For Le -

If we all do a little bit, wersquoll ensure the service is maintained for today, tomorrow and future generations.Earlier this year, local politicians agreed to take the lead in securing financial support for the air ambulance service and also make a monetary contribution to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs.The Department of Health allocates around poundm in annual funding to help keep the helicopter service in the air with money used to finance the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment. Charity funds, including public donations, sustains the aviation side of the operation.It was announced recently that as part of the ongoing consultation on reshaping stroke services, the Department has made a commitment to extend the partnership with Air Ambulance Northern Irelandto enable the helicopter emergency medical service to provide a secondary response to incidents, including strokes, by .Health officials have also confirmed that any changes to the existing arrangement would be subject to the completion of an appropriate business case and agreement with the air ambulance with regard to any funding implications..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity Beer and Bubbles 5k run in Finnebrogue  ","story":"M B McGRADY  Co Chartered Accountants is setting the pace this September with the launch of the Beer and Bubbles k run in a bid to raise money for Air Ambulance NI.Open to competitors of all ages and experiences, the race will take place on Thursday, September , at Finnebrogue Woods, nestled on the outskirts of Downpatrick.This is the first k race to take place at the idyllic venue, with the route mapped out so runners take in the stunning woodland and finish close to the lakeside, where they will be able to soak up the atmosphere while enjoying a glass of local beer or prosecco.The event follows on from last yearrsquos successful M B Grady  Co Ultimate Aqua Challenge,.Conaill McGrady, director of M B McGrady  Co, said: ldquoWe are delighted to be supporting Air Ambulance NI for a second year and helping to contribute to maintaining the vital work that they do.

They opened the scoring through Gareth George and he added a free to give the visitors an early cushion.Indeed, Bright had plenty more chances to add to this score, but were wasteful in their shot selection. The Holywood men finally woke up and a tidy score from Connor McAnespie after  minutes opened their account.Bright again replied with a fine score from Marc Burke before Martin Cox opened his account for Holywood with a point after  minutes. Barry Kilkey levelled the contest three minutes later from close range and Freddie OrsquoConnor scored for Bright to edge them ahead again.Foolish tackling and unnecessary frees were costing St Paulrsquos in the game and helped Bright dominate the play In the first half.The gamersquos opening goal, however, swung the play towards the Holywood men again. Fantastic work from Seaacuten Tucker around the middle of the park and his long ball into the danger area found Marty Cox in space.Cox caught the ball in mid-air, landed and turned in one motion before smashing the ball past Michael Ferrand, who had no chance. The sizable crowd roared with delight and momentum was now with St Paulrsquos as Tucker added another score from play.Once again, however, ill discipline and poor tackling would cost St Paulrsquos. Paddy Falls high tackle left George with a handy free to cut the deficit before Tucker added a free from m out on the left.George added the final score of the half for Bright leaving St Paulrsquos two points clear at the half-time whistle - to -.Bright again took the early initiative at the start of the second half and a point by Rian Tempany set the early tone. A big talking point came at six minutes into the second half when referee John McMullan sent off two players, one from each team after an altercation at a break downThe next few scores were to and fro with Tucker scoring three points and George replying in kind, aided by Tempany. The game was tied at - to - drawing at  when St Paulrsquosadded their second goal in the th minute.Fine work from Daniel Eastwood and Cox set up Tucker who danced around two Bright defenders before slotting the ball home from  metres. The home crowd were again in raptures, expecting St Paulrsquos to see the game out.However, game management has been a big problem this season for the Holywood men, given the average age of the team is  it is perhaps understandable that experience to see games out is just not there yet.St Paulrsquos tried to slow the game down, but with about  minutes still to be played, it was far too early for that. Bright caught St Paulrsquos in possession on numerous occasionsand turned the ball over for score after score.George was a constant threat and punished each mistake by the Holywood men with a score. Ably assisted by Freddie OrsquoConnor, the pair hauled the St Paulrsquos lead in until it was all square by the th minute.They again caught St Paulrsquos out and OrsquoConnor scored the winning point in the st minute.St Paulrsquos: Craig McKenna, Owen Loughran, Conor McPeake, Ryan Loughran, Ruairi Collins, Paddy Falls, Michael Collins , Gerard Walls, Patrick Eastwood, Martin Cox , Seaacuten Tucker , Daniel Eastwood, Barry Kilkey , Conor McAnespie .

He did, however, admit that the itinerary has been sent to Rome.Venues for the Popersquos visit are pure speculation and certainly newspapers are free to speculate, he added.It is understood that Downpatrick was one of the three venues north of the border suggested by the committee of  bishops, headed by Cardinal OrsquoFiaich, when they met last week.The decision on whether the Pope will include Northern Ireland in his tour will be taken in Rome, but it is believed that alternative venues in the Republic have been suggestedthe Pope decides not to cross the border.The choice of Downpatrick mdash with its strong historical links with Christianity and St Patrick mdash is understood to have been a move to give the Pope the opportunity to see as many people as possible.It is also thought that Armagh mdash the ecclesiastical headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland mdash and Londonderry were studied as possible venues for a visit.Until the programme is finalised, the only places certain to be included in the itinerary are Dublin and the Marian Shrine at Knock, County Mayo.Dr Joseph Maguire, Parish Priest of Downpatrick, said that he personally had not been contacted about any visit from Pope John Paul II, but he admitted that Downpatrick would have been one of the first places to think of.ldquoWe would be delighted to be so honoured with a visit from the Holy Father and he would be most welcome he said.KILLYLEAGH mdash A one-day token strike by production workers closed the Killyleagh Mill yesterday.Around  workers walked out, seeking a wages increase.

Two special zones will be developed for car parking on either side of the beach and a park for upwards of  cars will be provided in the centre, off the beach area.Under no circumstances, however, will cars be allowed to drive up and down the beach area and the council is expected to appoint full-time beach inspectors to supervise parking during the summer season.The private entrances presently used by beach-goers will be blocked off and two new public driveways will be constructed. It is thought that charges for cars to the beach will be scrapped.Other developments at the beach will include the provision of new toilet blocks and the construction of - self-catering holiday homes for renting.NEWCASTLE mdash A new peal of six church bells will ring out over Newcastle this year.

Her ability to converse with people of all ages was remarkable. Quick-witted and vivacious, she could captivate her audiences with compelling stories of her own experiences and those from her dazzling imagination.ldquoHer mothering compassionate nature led her to help those troubled or in need and she was often courageous in doing so, especially with being so sensitive herself.Mrs Brown added that her family and the local community had lost ldquoa little hero and spoke of her daughterrsquos ability to love.ldquoIf Kodi loved you, you knew.

Four weeks later, the worst news that Kodi had a brain tumour was confirmed and there were no curative treatments available.Her family refused to give up hope and took Kodi to Germany on a self-funded trip where pioneering immunotherapy was offered, alongside infusion treatments.However, the costs of the treatment were prohibitive and Gemmarsquos friends created the Kodirsquos Krew fundraising appeal to fund the treatment and living costs.The Killinchy community and her school backed the fundraising effort with local events being held weekly.Killinchy Primary School principal Chris Currie last night spoke of losing Kodi ldquowho was loved by everyone.ldquoThe whole school community is devastated at Kodirsquos loss, he said. ldquoShe was very much a bright light.

He was looking around on each side of him for some guidance and then the only contribution was that some civil servant said it was ‘a personnel matter’. But clearly he was not aware of it and seemed genuinely surprised.“My hope and expectation is that he’ll find out about the details but I’d think it’s quite a hard sell to defend what has happened where you have a UK government office where the picture of the head of state is not permitted to be displayed.“If you go to an American government office, President Trump’s picture will be on display,you go to an Irish government building you will see the picture of the Irish president – and rightly so. This whole thing is bonkers.”The News Letter first asked the NIO questions about the issue on Monday morning. Despite several reminders, the NIO did not respond until late on Tuesday night, after appearing to carefully consider its response – yet the brief response avoided answering the questions.Emergency council meeting called over Harland and Wolff shipyard crisis Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Throughout yesterday, as the story was picked up by the Nolan Show, the Frank Mitchell Show and the Belfast , the NIO refused to offer any substantive comment and did not dispute the accuracy of the News Letter story.Then last night, within minutes of BBC Newsline reporting on the controversy, the NIO released a statement from Secretary of State Julian Smith. In it he said that he was “delighted to see a picture of Her Majesty in my office when I arrived at Stormont House for the first time”.The NIO later claried that his first day in Stormont House was last Friday.The News Letter spoke to a well-placed source who last night expressed “utter surprise” when told about what Mr Smith had said.Last week UUP peer Lord Rogan had tabled parliamentary questions about the issue.When the NIO was asked by this newspaper whether the Queen’s picture had suddenly reappeared in Mr Smith’s office as recently as last week, an NIO spokesman said that he did not know.Mr Smith’s comments contradict those of NIO minister Lord Duncan. Last week, in answer to a written House of Lords question from Lord Rogan, he said that in line with advice from the Equality Commission the NIO was sensitive to the display of “posters, pictures, portraits or other displays that are more closely associated with one or other of the communities”, a phrase which includes the Queen, and added: “I can confirm that the department takes steps to ensure no such images are displayed in Stormont House.”TUV leader Jim Allister said that the situation needed to be “addressed urgently” by Mr Smith. DUP MP Paul Girvan said that the NIO’s decision was “grossly offensive and disrespectful to many people here in Northern Ireland”.It is not yet clear whether the portraits were removed because that was necessary under equality law or whether the NIO went far beyond what the law demands.However, in an indication of how the decision has the potential to undermine support for equality laws, Mr Girvan characterised the decision as “the outworking of the so-called ‘equality agenda’ that lies at the heart of the Belfast Agreement”.Last night Ulster-born Labour MP Kate Hoey said that “all the other pictures of Her Majesty must be put back” and said the episode raised questions for the NIO’s top official, Sir Jonathan Stephens.try catch  TrendingUpdated: PSNI probe sudden death of teenagerManarrested in N.I. on suspicion of sexual activity with a child arrested in N.I. on suspicion of sexual activity with a child\"N.I. mankilled in serious road traffic collision killed in serious road traffic collision\"Three vehicle road traffic collision -

And Irsquove also been talking about sport ndash this time football and ensuring young people can get involved in teams, but also have opportunities to progress within their chosen sport as well.In Westminster Irsquove been talking about serious violence and ensuring we get police on our streets to deal with kne crime and other violence, which sadly wersquove seen on the rise in some parts of the UK.Irsquove also been talking about the steel industry. Steel is a crucial backbone here in Wales, but there is worrying news from some parts of the industry across the UK. Irsquom glad to say that we have a thriving steel plant here in the constituency, employing a lot of people who produce steel for our construction industry and many other infrastructure projects ndash but itrsquos crucial that those projects are open to Welsh steel, in order to drive jobs and business here in our local community.In the Commons I challenged the Conservative Welsh Secretary over what I believe is his failure to stand up for our steel industry.I asked him: ldquoSteel is of course the foundation of any successful industrial strategy. So can the Secretary of State explain what he has done to offset the lost opportunity for Welsh steel producers of the lost Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon and the electrication to Swansea \"What projects has he actually secured to provide procurement opportunities for Welsh steel producers  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

The pension applies to both Vale and Cardf council workers.Friends of the Earth Cymru congratulated the council.Spokeswoman Bleddyn Lake said: ldquoAfter years of lobbying by Friends of the Earth, itrsquos fantastic to see Cardf councillors taking the historic decision to stop supporting the fossil fuel companies that are fuelling the climate crisis.ldquoNow itrsquos time for all the local authority pension funds in Wales to follow Cardfrsquos lead.ldquoToo many have been hiding away from taking meaningful action, but a climate emergency means we cannot afford to be investing money in the very companies driving climate change.ldquoResearch has shown esting from fossil fuel companies is better financially and will minimise future financial risks for those with pensions in these funds.ldquoClimate change is the challenge of our age. We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

focused  ","story":"A family have spoken of their pride after their son defied the odds to graduate from Ulster University#s Magee campus.Joel Emerson, who was diagnosed with autism at the age of three, graduated with a . in Business Information Systems on July .The -year-old attended Ceara School in Lurgan for two years before transferring to Richmount Primary on the Moy Road and then to Donacloney Primary to finish his primary education.Praising the educators who supported her son in his early years, Joel’s mother Rhonda said: “When Joel started Ceara, he didn’t have many communication skills. After his two years there his communication skills had improved and he was able to move into mainstream education. He’d been introduced to the schedule system and this helped immensely.“Joel received support from a classroom assistant at Richmount and also when he moved to Donacloney. Joel then moved to Dromore High. He worked hard in his GCSEs and A levels and was able to go on to study at Magee. We’re very proud of what he has achieved.”Although Joel’s graduation was a chance to celebrate his educational successes, it was also an emotional day for the family. Rhonda added: “My mother Margaret Boyd passed away before Joel’s graduation. She had bought Joel’s laptop that he used at Magee and had been very supportive during his educational journey.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/NI-Chamber-President.jpg","title":"ni politicians must not waste time amid restoration talks","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s politicians “must not waste time” amid ongoing talks at restoring an Executive while business here should employ the “collaborative vision” that saw industries grow following the Good Friday Agreement.

That’s a welcome step forward. But after two years without movement of any kind, we shouldn’t expect results in a hurry.” Speaking about the Chamber’s attempt to host the World Chambers Congress, he said: “Less than two weeks ago, NI Chamber along with the British Chamber of Commerce and Chambers Ireland were in Rio at the World Chambers Congress, showcasing Northern Ireland as a potential host for the conference in . “Held every two years in a dferent region of the world, the World Chambers Congress provides unparalleled opportunities to connect and strengthen relations with a erse and international group of iniduals representing more than  countries. “The bid,successful, could bring an estimated economic value of £.m to Northern Ireland and we were joined in Rio by our strategic partners including Invest Northern Ireland, Belfast City Council, Visit Belfast and ICC Belfast.” Those attending the lunch also heard from Eddie O’Sullivan, former head coach to the Irish national rugby team, and gaelic football legend Pat Spillane.
