In addition, contracts have been signed totalling £12.6billion (in 2019 prices).  The line involves the construction of a new Y-shaped 225mph rail network that is expected to connect London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Construction work started in September on Phase 1 of HS2 from London to Birmingham. Phase 2a is planned to run from Birmingham to Crewe, and Phase 2b from Crewe to Manchester, and from Birmingham to Leeds. "},{"url":null,"title":"Girl 17 left burns face iPhone charger burst flames","story":"Share this article Amie also took to social media to share pictures of her nasty burns and to highlight the dangers of overnight phone charging.She wrote on Facebook: \u0027Please keep in mind when charging your phone.\u0027So 2am this morning I was lying down as you do on my phone.

Levine took the photo and in a matter of seconds, the woman was gone. “It’s an image of a fleeting moment, which I observe with no other intent other than to memorialize the scene,” said Levine, who calls the photo Red Upsweep. It’s on the cover of a new book called Women Street Photographers, which came out earlier this month with Prestel Publishing. It showcases 100 female photographers who shoot on the streets, pounding the pavement for their best shots, from Paris to Pakistan and beyond. Edited by Gulnara Samoilova, who founded the Women Street Photographers website and Instagram account, it showcases women who captured some of the most memorable fleeting moments in time. “I like to think street photography brings the people together,” said Samoilova. “The more work I see, the more I realize we are only at the beginning of a journey into the female gaze. The more men and women see the world through women’s eyes, the more humanizing and relatable we become to one another, despite our differences.” It shows that there’s more to street photography than men such as Bill Cunningham, Joel Meyerowitz or Henri-Cartier Bresson, that their often overlooked female counterparts are long past due for the spotlight. Women have been shooting on the streets since photography was popularized in the 19th century. Documentaries, feature films and large-scale exhibitions have been quietly honoring female photographers, like Finding Vivian Maier, a documentary about a nanny who took over 150,000 pictures over her lifetime, or the recent retrospective and book of Helen Levitt, who documented the streets of New York during the Great Depression of the 1930s. This book features the latest crop of female street photographers, women of all ages, disciplines and nationalities, including Danielle L Goldstein, who photographed a person walking through an underground metro system in New York City from behind. The photo is a combination of what she hopes to capture, both the dull and frenetic moments of city life. “Each singular being has a story to tell,” said Goldstein. “The camera is transformational it emboldens and energizes me in a way that nothing else can.” Though she has photographed all over the world, Goldstein does her best work in her home city. “Out of familiarity, comes deeper understanding and emotion,” she said. “This photograph reflects a particular time in my life when I felt quite alone. And yet, one can never be entirely alone in this city.” Another photo in the book is by Nina Kling, who shot a man crossing Madison Avenue with smoke covering his face. “Street photography is about being in the present,” said Kling. “I love observing people and the challenge of organizing the visual clutter of a busy city into a single, split-second frame while being immersed in everyday life, that is, capturing and documenting the now.” Hamburg-based photographer Elena Alexandra took a photo she calls Sleeping Beauty, which is in the book, depicting a woman in red sleeping peacefully on a train. “This photo is very special to me,” she said. She snapped it on a train from Hamburg to Odense, Denmark, in 2019. “My head and heart were full of dark thoughts and feelings,” said Alexandra. “I felt sad, heartbroken and weak. But in the gloom, I noticed the girl in red sleeping opposite to me. Something inside of me said: ‘Take a picture!’” Alexandra took the photo. A few weeks later, it became her most successful yet, winning her awards and being included in many exhibitions. “That positive resonance gave me encouragement to live through the sad time I was having but the most inspiring was the lesson I learned from it,” said Alexandra. “Life can be a gloomy place sometimes, but even in these moments there is a light inside of me that will guide me out of the darkness, if I am brave enough to follow it. Among the other highlights in the book, there are photos of portraits, group shots, street scenes and closeups. In one, a hand is captured under stark sunlight by Michelle Groskopf, in such a gentle pose, it could be mistaken for a Michelangelo painting. In another, a fleet of birds fly above a shadowy figure by Dimpy Bhalotia, shot from below. Street style is the focus of two stylish dandies shot by Dominique Mishrahi, wearing fur coats and sunglasses, while Efrat Sela captures a group of men crawling over a modern piece of architecture. To Levine, each photo is a diary of the moment. “Oftentimes, these candid images on the streets are reminders of parts of my life that are locked away within my mind, or those which were simply forgotten,” she said. It’s also a map of her explorations, urban adventures, as a photographer. “New York has been a place that I can wander the streets relatively inconspicuously and feel as if I am part of a bigger society,” Levine said. “The simple pleasure of observing both mundane and exotic moments feed my continual desire to explore neighborhoods and places that are outside my day to day.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a53a59bdab172207416f07486536594a77cd06e4/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a8b9cda5aa593b990caf5801d26d4d88","title":"liverpool city governance conservatives council","story":"Liverpool’s voters might wonder what the point will be of heading to the polls in six weeks’ time to elect their new mayor and councillors. No one will be electing the commissioners arriving in the city. They are accountable only to the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, Robert “towns fund” Jenrick and that well-known friend of Liverpool, Boris Johnson. The commissioners will tell the councillors and mayor what to do, not the other way round. Today’s council inspection report, authored by Max Caller, a veteran cleaner-up of other authorities, makes exceedingly damning reading. It refers to multiple failures including a serious breakdown of governance what Jenrick describes as the “awarding of dubious contracts” retrospective documentation (or its location in skips) an overall environment of intimidation a pervasive culture of “rule avoidance” and the absence of ethics. The report is as bad as it gets. Doing nothing was not an option for the government. Critics will lambast the arrival of commissioners as a “Tory takeover”. But that is far too simplistic, even if the optics are not great. Commissioners are genuine experts in local government, and apolitical. The Conservatives have sent them in to run one of their own problem councils, Northamptonshire. They will work alongside the respected chief executive, Tony Reeves, who remains in overall control. The chief executive tends to be the power and the brains behind the operation on most councils anyway. Liverpool might be better governed, but it won’t be democratic. For the next three years, the commissioners and the chief executive will run the biggest problem areas – planning, highways and regeneration – most closely associated with the lamented regime of the previous mayor, Joe Anderson. The commissioners, not the council or the new mayor, will hold the purse strings in these arenas.  A decade ago, the Conservative government placed great faith in directly elected mayors as city saviours. They were to be the standard bearers of local democracy, directly accountable to the council taxpayers electing them. Caller’s report shows a starkly different reality from the democratic utopia once envisaged. Local government by cabal, not council is the message. Meanwhile, Merseyside police’s investigation into allegations of corruption – which forced the government to act – continues apace. That has seen Anderson arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. Four other men were also arrested as part of the investigation, as was the city’s director of regeneration, dismissed by the council this week. All six deny wrongdoing and none have been charged. Those wanting a full restoration of local democracy face a long wait. The government has used powers of intervention under the 1999 Local Government Act a mere three times. It took three years to restore local power in each case and Jenrick has indicated a similar timeline here. Liverpool follows Northamptonshire, Rotherham and Tower Hamlets. Special measures are sustained ones. Today’s verdict gives vent to the criticisms of the mayor and alleged council cronyism, expressed in forthright terms on social media for years. The shenanigans of the 1980s, when Derek Hatton and the city council took on Thatcher, might have been crazy and futile but at least had a political cause. The Liberal Democrats took charge in 1998, but lost to Labour in 2010. The Liberal Democrat leader, Warren Bradley, was convicted of perjury after an electoral fraud investigation. His successor as council leader was Anderson. Liverpool doesn’t do controversy-free. Liverpool is a remarkable city that has made huge strides, despite brutal central government financial allocations. It deserves better. The Conservative government may be nervous about intervening in Tory-free Liverpool. The city’s “red wall” is one of the few sections that remains impregnable. But Labour nationally also seems fearful of Liverpool Labour. It supports Jenrick’s move, embarrassed by the antics of the mayor and some council members. Labour nationally decides the party’s Liverpool mayoral candidate to replace Anderson this May. Its selection committee has already decided that three female councillors, with a combined 43 years of council experience, are not good enough. Their candidacies were halted, and each told, humiliatingly, they need not reapply. A new surprise shortlist of two novice councillors emerged, the choice imminent. A belated referendum on whether the city should have an elected mayor is scheduled for 2023. All-out elections will also take place, to put in place a new, cleansed and streamlined council. But we already know the winner of the 2021 contests: Robert Jenrick.

And exclusion rates for mixed-race white and black Caribbean students were more than four times higher than their white peers in several local authorities. The figures for the 2018-19 academic year were described as extremely concerning by Anne Longfield, the former children’s commissioner for England, while the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who commissioned House of Commons Library research into racial disparities in school exclusions, called for a “universal code”. Figures show that in Cambridgeshire the fixed-term exclusion rate for black Caribbean pupils was more than six times higher than the rate for white British students, while in the London boroughs of Brent, Harrow and Haringey, the rate was more than five times higher. Though Cambridgeshire has a relatively small number of Caribbean students, which partially explains the disparity, Brent, Harrow and Haringey have significant Caribbean populations. Fixed-period exclusions are when a pupil is formally suspended from school for a set time, usually up to three days. The DfE says they must be “on disciplinary grounds” but the reasons for exclusion are at teachers’ discretion. The fixed-term rate is the total number of exclusions as a proportion of the headcount, and includes instances where multiple suspensions were given to one student over the course of a year. But Nicholas Treloar, a researcher at the race equality thinktank Runnymede Trust, said government-imposed targets and the constant pressure from Ofsted to “achieve” were to blame for higher exclusion rates. “Exclusions essentially criminalise children, and disproportionately impact on the poorest and most vulnerable. Children that, when excluded, do not have the socioeconomic means of buffering against the dangers of being out of school,” he said. “Research and data has shown that school exclusions have a detrimental impact on all schoolchildren in terms of educational outcomes and attainment levels. With BAME and Gypsy, Roma and Traveller children being disproportionately excluded, this will then have the biggest impact on these already vulnerable groups.” Moran said the figures had highlighted an “incredible injustice” for schoolchildren from an ethnic minority background. “I believe we need a universal code with clear criteria setting out the grounds for exclusions, to prevent any forms of bias and discrimination,” she said. “With coronavirus looking likely to lead to a rise in exclusions, this is more important than ever.” In Sheffield, which has the second-highest population of Roma children in the country, the Roma exclusion rate was nine times higher than for white students. In Haringey and Bristol, Roma students were more than 10 times as likely to receive an exclusion, although their headcounts were much lower than in Sheffield, with about 100 students each.  Students from an Irish Traveller background also experienced disproportionately high exclusion rates, though only 11 areas in the country had an Irish Traveller headcount of more than 100. Esther, the mother of a 13-year-old Gypsy child who was excluded from a school in a Sussex market town, said she felt teachers consistently failed to understand the needs of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities. Esther’s son was excluded after he fought with another pupil. She said the incident had occurred after her son had been subjected to months of xenophobic abuse. “The school knew that he had been called names for months and he ended up retaliating – just like anyone would – but he was the one who got permanently excluded. I battled so hard to try to get them to let him back in, but they wouldn’t,” she said. Sarah Mann, the director of Friends, Families and Travellers, a charity advocating for the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities, described the high exclusion rates as devastating. “They demonstrate the abject failure of local authorities and central government in addressing the staggering inequalities experienced by Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities from the cradle to the grave,” she said. DfE data shows the national fixed-term inclusions rate has increased every year since 2014-15. Some academy chains have been found to exclude children at very high rates, often using them to enforce “zero tolerance” uniform policies. Cllr Kaushika Amin, Haringey’s cabinet member for children, education and families, said disproportionality in exclusion rates was on the agenda for every school in the borough, and that the council was committed to addressing BAME inequalities in education. A spokesperson for Cambridgeshire said: “Our schools’ priority will always be the child’s safety and wellbeing, and as such full support – including additional provision for home education and a forward plan to re-integrate the child back to school – will be provided to the pupil and their family.” A spokesperson for Gloucestershire county council said the authority was aware of this area of disparity within the school system and was actively working to address it. Andrew Jones, the director of education and skills at Sheffield city council, said: “As with many local authorities, there is an all too high number of children being excluded from school. This is something we take very seriously, and consistently and persistently work with our schools to reduce. “We know that we have a lot more work to do. However, we are working hard to ensure inclusivity and equity are the centre of all that we do to support children in our education system.” Wokingham and Bristol city council declined to comment. The DfE said it was investing £10m in new “behaviour hubs” for schools to share best practices on discipline. A spokesperson for the department added: “Being excluded from school should not mean exclusion from high-quality education, but we will always back headteachers to use exclusions when required as part of creating calm and disciplined classrooms that bring out the best in every pupil.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/896830e219e5c3e8ba1ad60ca57553867115b5f5/0_578_4015_2410/master/4015.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1e6c22755f5b24a25f177bae4b3290da","title":"soils ability to absorb carbon emissions may be overestimated study","story":"Soils and the plants that grow in them absorb about a third of the carbon emissions that drive the climate crisis, partly limiting the impact of fossil-fuel burning. Rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere can increase plant growth and, until now, it was assumed carbon storage in soils would increase too. It is not yet known how big the effect of lower carbon storage in soils might be on the speed of climate change, and experts cautioned that other impacts of the climate emergency such as drought would also affect how well plants and soils store carbon. “We found that when rising CO2 increases plant growth, there is a decrease in soil carbon storage. That’s a very important conclusion,” said César Terrer, who led the research while at Stanford University in the US. He said that if soils do absorb less in future, “the speed of global warming could be higher”. Terrier said soils, plants and trees were important for carbon levels, but that ending the burning of fossil fuels remains essential. “If we really want to stop global warming, we need to stop emissions, because ecosystems only take up a fraction of all the CO2 emissions,” he said. It was thought that biomass and soil carbon would increase in tandem, as more plant biomass falls to the ground and turns into organic matter. But increased plant and tree growth requires more nutrients from the soil, which may explain the new finding, the scientists said. Extracting the extra nutrients requires the plants to increase the symbiotic microbial activity in their roots, which then releases CO2 to the atmosphere that might otherwise have remained locked in the soil. He said the change would be determined by the balance between rising CO2 boosting plant growth and the negative effects of climate change itself, including drought, heatwaves and fires. The evidence to date suggests the biggest change will be the negative effects of global heating on ecosystems, he said. Prof Pete Smith at the University of Aberdeen said: “The combined effect of CO2 on plants and soils and on climate change is what matters in terms of the real world response.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d1ed3812c22d7d0d0f138fc58966f218620c2f/0_0_7665_4601/master/7665.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=80fcc2230d8b60262b6ae3dd6fec6be5","title":"from doughnut deliveries to thali feasts the food businesses with an appetite to adapt","story":"Though many small businesses have faced challenging times, others have embraced the unknown, and despite some ups and downs, are showing that out of chaos, can come reward. For Mandira Sarkar, owner of Mandira’s Kitchen, and deluxe doughnut makers Project D, pivoting quickly has become almost as much of an art form as their products. Sarkar’s business, launched in 2016, is based in a converted 16th-century barn outbuilding overlooking the picturesque Silent Pool lake near Guildford, Surrey. With an all-female (“except for one very brave man”) staff of 20, it produces home-style freezer meals – authentic, healthy dishes such as watercress dal and chicken xacuti, plus a range of samosas and biryanis. The business has a catering service, an onsite cafe and shop, and a cookery school. Pre-pandemic, it also offered spice tours for groups keen to learn about Indian flavours, followed by a meal in the cafe. But Mandira’s Kitchen has had to adapt almost every component of its operations. When they had to close their kiosks, the team had to completely rethink their business model. “We initially furloughed our 26 members of staff,” says Poynton. A few weeks later, though, as public demand for baking essentials skyrocketed, they brought them all back – Project D’s access to local farms had put them in a good position to sell eggs, flour and yeast. “We got our gazebo out and we were popping up in village car parks and town square car parks. We had hour-long queues for eggs. Looking back, it was really insane,” Poynton says. Once given council permission to sell doughnuts alongside the other staple essentials, they also started a doughnut delivery service, which has continued to attract high demand. Sarkar, too, remembers panicking “for about two days”, but then she and her team quickly got to work. Farm shops – the main customers of their freezer meals – were themselves struggling, so she began to market to inidual customers instead. Launching a brand new website, Sarkar pushed out the message that their tasty, healthy meals were perfect to have at home, and available at the click of a button. Local orders were soon followed by UK-wide demand. Sarkar kept innovating. First she enhanced her click-and-collect service, offering weekend thali feasts, a three-course meal complete with a Bollywood playlist, a quiz on India, and takeaway picnic baskets. They began to collaborate with a nearby vineyard and gin distillery, offering meals with accompanying wine, and jointly marketing to customers against the backdrop of the growing consumer movement to buy locally. Sarkar is also leading a weekly free cooking lesson that people can follow on Instagram Live. A special kit of six spice blends can be ordered beforehand to ensure the outcome is authentic. All these adaptations, says Sarkar, have resulted in their pandemic-era sales far outstripping the previous year’s. Both Sarkar and Project D mention the importance of persevering even when the going gets tough. “We’ve always had the attitude of never giving up,” says Bond. “We have this dream, this project, which we hold so dearly. And when that was nearly taken away from us, with everything that we put in, we weren’t ready to give up.” Strong branding was also key to Project D, who sold eggs using trays in their signature bubblegum pink. Their scooter, mini pickup truck, forklift and even the floors of their new bakery are all painted in the same shade. Although difficult in a pandemic, planning ahead as best as they can has also been an important element of their success. As the end of the Brexit transition period loomed, the team stockpiled some of their ingredients. “And we were right to do that, because some of our wholesalers actually ran out of some of our key ingredients,” says Poynton. For both of these independent food businesses, the past year has been hectic, often stressful, but in the end, hugely rewarding. For Sarkar, it has sometimes meant 18- or 19-hour days at work. “You can probably see the bags under our eyes,” she says. “But we’ve constantly, every day, innovated, adapted and been flexible at every single stage.” "},{"url":null,"title":"from diy kits to sustainable bespoke furniture meet the businesses reshaping interior design","story":"Given this, the digital video meetings we’ve all become used to can only take a designer so far. Nonetheless, the sector itself is proving resilient eight out of 10 people, according to a survey conducted by the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) in October, wanted to change their homes as soon as it was safe to do so. “The impact of Covid-19 will affect how and where we choose to live for years to come,” says Riba president Alan Jones. “For many of us, our homes are our sanctuaries, and this research indicates that many people are keener than ever to adapt and improve their homes.” Many interior designers across the UK report an increase in the number of new clients they have taken on. But as the process relies so heavily on being physically present in a space, they have had to adapt. Zoe Hewett is no stranger to finding creative ways around problems. When she first started her interior design business, Stylemongers of Bristol, the former set designer for theatre and TV productions lacked the funds to make over her own home to serve as a showcase – so instead she built a doll’s house to demonstrate her style. As a result of the pandemic, Hewett scaled back her face-to-face work, but has still found ways of expanding her business – one of which is a range of interior design kits to help people design their own homes. “At first, I was thinking about making my services accessible,” she says. “A one-to-one design consultation is worth doing for a bespoke service, but it’s always going to be out of reach for some people, so I wanted to offer something affordable, at a price point more people could afford.” The pandemic meant the project became a priority for her business, and the packs became a reality. “I may have created an envelope-stuffing role for myself,” she says. “But I love that people are getting something physical and tangible to work with.” The packs are made of recycled card and paper and are delivered in letterbox-sized packages. Hewett sees them as a way of sharing the information and techniques that she previously discussed in face-to-face workshops, where she would guide groups through the principles of interior design – from creating moodboards to where to place furniture. They contain, among other things, quizzes to help buyers explore design choices, advice on using colour and materials to create 2D-scale layouts of rooms, plus a link to an ebook with further information. Hewett says the take-up of the £50 kits has been “pretty good. I hope people find them fun as well as useful. One lady who bought one said she’s using it again with her seven-year-old to reimagine their shed. Her daughter’s got really into it, apparently.” From each commission, Hewett makes a donation to the homeless charity Crisis. “Creating nice places is what drives me,” she says. “So it makes sense to me to also help people who haven’t got anywhere to live yet.” The community focus is also important to Liselle Milner of Zenterior Design, based in St Austell, Cornwall. She works with 12 others, including builders, carpenters and upholsterers, to create indoor and outdoor spaces and bespoke furniture, all with a focus on using sustainable materials. Much of her work involves second homes or holiday lets, so the owners have not been able to travel to meet her. “We’ve always focused on the relationship with the client, getting an idea of exactly what it is they want and then making that happen, so to never meet someone face-to-face has been very odd,” she says. “Although, if you are talking to someone via Zoom, there is the advantage of seeing their house in the background, so it’s a very quick way of seeing what they already like.” Milner uses a lot of secondhand or upcycled furniture – “I want the space to look as amazing as possible for the budget we have” – but her pre-pandemic visits to charity shops and auctions have been replaced by Facebook Marketplace, and ever-greater resourcefulness as a team. “We’re looking at things we would usually outsource, like quilting, for example, and thinking: ‘Can we do that ourselves?’” she says. “It’s good creatively, and it also means we can keep to a schedule. Big furniture retailers have set specifics they work to. If a piece is made of oak, and if the oak isn’t there, then that sofa won’t be with you in 12 weeks’ time. But if we are making it, then we can use beech or another suitable wood that we can actually get hold of.” Besides changing their ways of working to comply with pandemic-related restrictions, such as visiting sites inidually instead of together, the Zenterior team have also adapted some of the other physical parts of their jobs, finding ways to keep to social distancing rules, and have stopped working on occupied domestic properties. Milner has also doubled down on Zenterior’s commitment to using local suppliers, not only to avoid delays with supply chains but also from a sense of local responsibility, as the regional tourism sector has been hit especially hard by restrictions on movement. “And there’s also the fact that Cornwall has always been a hub for artists and creative people. It makes sense to work with people who are here,” says Milner. The pandemic may have affected their traditional ways of working for now, but both Milner and Hewett are determined that its lasting effects on our homes are sustainably positive.

In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was created from the regions of the three western occupation powers (the US, UK and France) and the German Democratic Republic was created from the Soviet occupation zone. The two new states, both trying to recover from the horror of the second world war and Nazi rule, forged new identities under very different socio-political regimes. Both created iconic designs during those Cold War years, such as the Trebant and the Porsche. One of the first Apple computers was made in West Germany by Frog Design, while the wonderfully named Robotron was the state-owned company that created PC 1715 for the GDR’s state-owned companies and government offices. The homeware and furniture created for all the new-build housing constructed to replace the bombed-out ruins left by the war made design stars out of Dieter Rams, Rudolf Horn and Klaus Kunis. This exhibition is the first to look at design in East and West Germany as a shared history, showing the connections as well as the many cultural differences. A unique insight into how design makes sense of the world around us – and the history of a country unlike any other.German Design: 1949 – 1989 Two Countries, One History is at the Vitra Design Museum until 5 September. Go to the website for online opening days Creative people are often referred to as working “in a erse range of disciplines”. Faye Toogood may well trump them all. Her furniture is in major design museums, her clothes are in Vogue and her lighting is sold in Mayfair boutiques. She has curated her own furniture fair, designed shop interiors and, with her sister, made a set of coats for visitors to wear as they explore the V\u0026ampA. Now the British designer is launching Toogood Homeware. The debut collection is split between two lines: Dough (mugs, jugs, bowls) and Plough (geometric throws). The Dough range is based on imperfect, hand-thrown pottery, with a pleasing plumpness – like bread rising in the oven. The two Plough throws take inspiration from the handmade craft of traditional weavers, plus the look of freshly ploughed country fields. “It was important for me to keep our new homeware collection accessible – everyday, decorative objects that still embody the sculptural, rounded forms we are known for,” she says. “Paired with the handwoven throws, the resulting family of products were the perfect combination of classic and playful.” Also new this month is a Toogood x Birkenstock collection, featuring idiosyncratic takes on the celebrated sandal in canvas, felt and suede, clothing and a bed made up of puffy layers of leather and canvas with a cork base – the ideal spot, perhaps, to dream up another new idea. This month, funding for the first LGBT+ retirement community in London was agreed. The mayor of London confirmed a community housing loan for Tonic Housing to buy 19 homes in Bankhouse, a Norman Foster-designed development in Vauxhall overlooking the Thames. The Bankhouse properties are for sale through the Older Persons Shared Ownership scheme, which means they will remain as a community asset. Anna Kear, CEO of Tonic Housing says: “We’re realising a long-held dream to provide a safe place for older LGBT+ people to live well in a community where they can be themselves and enjoy their later life. We’re so excited to get our future residents settled in their new homes and living in our community. Moving in is just the beginning.” The 10 artists shortlisted for the Award ceramics prize have been announced. The ceramicists’ work will appear in an exhibition at the British Ceramics Biennial, also called Award. This group show tries to document the current trends and innovations in pottery, providing a snapshot of the contemporary ceramics scene. The pieces picked for this year’s exhibition certainly demonstrate how varied the current crop of ceramicists are, both in style and artistic ambition. Through vessels, mosaics and sculpture these potters explore environmental, political and social themes. Artist Alison Cooke is creating an installation using clay dug from beneath the North Sea, acquired through a collaboration with scientific research project Europe’s Lost Frontiers. Connor Coulston’s work is inspired by charity shop ornaments and looks at social issues. His work for Award reimagines a Christmas angel ornament as a depressed single mother of four. Ho Lai is making a series of red-stained, bone china wall hangings in the outline of Hong Kong, a comment on government policy on migration. There will also be table settings, large-scale ceramics made with technical tools and even a ceramic silhouette of a refugee boat. The Award show will be a focal point of the British Ceramics Biennial this September and one artist will be awarded a £5,000 prize for excellent and creative ambition.AWARD is the headline exhibition in the British Ceramics Biennial. The festival runs 11 September - 17 October 2021 When lockdown fell last year, life would never be the same again. Many people had to abandon or radically alter their plans, and Luke Adam Hawker was one of them. An architect turned artist, Hawker made his name with projects inspired by the world outside. There’s Great Trees – drawings of the public’s favourite trees, as documented by the charity Trees for Cities – and Blue Plaque Doors, a series of sketches of the entrances to the buildings bearing English Heritage memorial blue plaques. Deprived of the outdoors, Hawker turned inward. “It was hard to give up the freedom to draw on location, something I had built into my life as a cornerstone of both my work and my happiness. Though it was a relatively small sacrifice compared to those being made by so many – and this restriction ultimately led to drawing in a far more reflective and introspective way.” Hawker spent his time at home in London with his sketchpad, trying to make sense of what was going on around him. The result is Together, a graphic book that records the unfolding pandemic through the eyes of an old man and his dog. “My grandad was my main father figure when I was growing up. He was a real BFG at 6’7”, a calm and reliable force in my life. I felt as though he was the perfect person to take us through the story. It also turned out to be a very therapeutic process for me to reconnect with him.” The dog is based on his own pet, Robin. “She has lifted my spirits on so many occasions and I knew their relationship would be a source of friendship and love.” Together is a deceptively simple book, the detailed illustrations pull readers into an accurate and thoughtful account of one of the most challenging years in modern history. As Hawker says: “The drawings in this book helped me to process and reflect on this difficult time. My hope is that people find something within these pages to help them do the same.”Together by Luke Adam Hawker is published by Kyle Books, £16.99 www.octopusbooks • This article was amended on 24 March 2021.

Certifying officers – typically vets – need to check each consignment before departure. Traders need to input details into at least five databases, while obtaining multiple certificates, reference numbers, documents and permits – all of which result in a mound of paperwork.  What follows is an example of all the possible steps an exporter faces to ensure a shipment of meat from Great Britain reaches a customer in the EU. It includes a physical inspection of the goods by customs in France, which currently takes place for about one in five loads. If the load is rejected, delivery can be delayed, and in the worst case the goods are re-exported or even destroyed. Even once the trader has completed all the necessary steps to export their meat, smooth passage is not guaranteed. As sausage maker Helen Browning’s Organics discovered during their two attempts at moving meat from Great Britain to its manufacturing site in the EU since January, any errors in the paperwork, missing information, or sheer bad luck can lead to shipments being held up for several days at French customs. Delays are not only costly for businesses, but can result in a much shorter shelf life for perishable items, making traders unpopular with their retail customers, or even leading to empty supermarket shelves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c3201dca5de4527d03cd867322eee4216610b83/0_31_3133_1880/master/3133.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=52237349d4e424192296307eb7e4f766","title":"stacey abrams republicans voter suppression interview","story":"There may be no politician better suited for a moment when democracy is under attack than Stacey Abrams. A decade ago, when few saw any chance of Georgia becoming a Democratic state, Abrams pushed to invest in turning out Black, Latino and Asian American voters, who had long been overlooked by politicians campaigning in the state. And when she ran for governor in 2018, Abrams made voter suppression a centerpiece of her campaign, underscoring the way that America fails to live up to the promise of its democracy by denying the right to vote to so many eligible citizens. Now many of the issues Abrams has been raising for years have exploded and are at the center of American politics.  spoke to Abrams, who is widely expected to run again for governor next year, about this uniquely dangerous moment in American democracy. How is what we’re seeing now similar to and different from what we’ve seen in the past? The coordinated onslaught of voter suppression bills is not the norm. What’s happened over the last 15 years has been a steady build where we’ve seen bills passing in multiple state legislatures over time. It was absolutely voter suppression, but it was this slow boil. It’s that terrible analogy of the frog in the water as the water starts to boil. Unless this is what you do and unless this is what you pay attention to, folks like me were watching, but it was fairly invisible to the untrained eye that voter suppression was sweeping across the country, especially beyond the boundaries of the south. What is so notable about this moment, and so disconcerting, is that they are not hiding. There is no attempt to pretend that the intention is not to restrict votes. The language is different. They use the veil, they used the farce of voter fraud to justify their actions. Their new term of art is election integrity. But it is a laughable word or phrase to use. It is designed based on anything but a question of integrity. The truth of the matter is there is no voter fraud. The truth of the matter is we had the most secure election that we’ve had. And therefore, their integrity is really insincerity. They are responding to the big lie, to the disproven, discredited and, sadly, the blood-spilled lie of voter fraud. And they are responding to it by actually doing what the insurrectionists sought, doing what the liars asked for. In your view, how linked is this to race? Would we be seeing these kinds of restrictions if there wasn’t that kind of explosion of turnout among Black voters that we saw in the election? Well, I would say it’s inexorably linked to race, but I want to be really clear. Black voters are of course at the center of the target, but what is happening in Arizona, what is happening in Florida is also attacking Latino voters. They are attacking the energy and enthusiasm of Native American voters. They are attacking Asian American voters. While Black voters are of course at the center because of the historical animus that seems to exist towards our participation in elections, this is also about attacking other communities of color. And we are seeing it being done with an assiduousness and an attention to detail that is, as we said before, unparalleled, except for when you look at the actions of Jim Crow. And then the corollary is that they are also attacking young people. Because it wasn’t just the increase in voters of color. It was the increase in young people and it’s that cross-pollination of young people of color that I think is also ginning up a great deal of this anger. What we are seeing are also bills that are designed to thwart young people taking possession of the power that comes with their generational might. They are the largest cohort. And they showed signs of leveraging that in the 2020 election. And now we are seeing a reaction to that, a response, that is lumping them in with every other undesirable voter class, which primarily is driven by race, by age and by income. What would the implications for our democracy be if these measures pass and are enacted and upheld by the courts? It would be the exact intention of voter suppression. Which is that we shut duly eligible citizens out of participation in setting the course of the country. We will not have effective responses to challenges that disproportionately harm communities of color. We will not tackle the existential crises that we face as a nation, as a world. We will not hear conversations in the legislative body about racial injustice, about climate action, about bodily autonomy. When you can cordon off and extricate entire communities from participation, their voices are not only silenced, the policies that have allowed their participation in just our larger civic life are also chilled. The larger ethos is this. There are those who say, ‘Well, OK these communities get harmed, it’s a dismal reality, they will not be moved by that.’ But as I keep repeating, when you break democracy, you break it for everyone. Because while they may start with communities of color and young people and poor people, there are intersections in terms of policymaking that affect those who want to be benefited by these processes. And benefited by these policies. They’re not going to stop with simply poor Latino voters. They’re also going to attack wealthy Latino voters who may need to vote in a different way because of the way they make their money. When you break the machinery, you break it for everyone. When that happens, the durability of our democracy is immeasurably weakened to the place where we become just as vulnerable to authoritarian regimes, just as vulnerable to majoritarian instincts and just as vulnerable to the collapse of democracy as any other nation state. You were quoted the other day about the need for businesses to come in and play a larger role in taking a stand against some of these measures in Georgia and elsewhere. Have you been disappointed to see the muted stances companies have taken? As someone who served in the legislature, I am very aware of the delayed engagement that tends to happen with the business community. And so I’m not surprised by the current reticence to be involved. But I am challenging the intention to remain quiet. We are obliged at this moment to call for all voices to be lifted up. And for the alarm to ring not only through the communities that are threatened directly, but by those businesses that rely on the durability of our democracy. That’s my point, the fact that no one can escape the scourge. We know that the consequences of a disconnected democracy, the consequences of a lack of civic participation are that we have a weakened civil society. That costs money. When people aren’t invested, when they feel that they have been pushed out of participation, they have no reason to trust or to conform. And so for the business community, it is a danger to their bottom line, to see a disconnection develop and be embedded in state laws that essentially say to rising populations that ‘you are not wanted and therefore we are not going to countenance your participation’. Because if you tell someone they aren’t wanted they’re going to assume you can’t say anything else to them. It is a dangerous thing for the business community to be silent. We have a conservative supreme court, we’re about to undergo another round of redistricting where Republicans have a clear advantage in the states again, a green light to use partisan gerrymandering. The filibuster in the Senate. I think a lot of people look at that and it’s so hard for them to have hope that any of this is going to get fixed – or that there is a path to fixing it. I’m curious what you see when you look at those institutions and how people should think about them as obstacles to achieving full democracy? I’d begin with the most efficient tool. And that is the filibuster. There is a credible argument to be made that the exceptions that have already been accepted for the filibuster should apply to protecting democracy. It is unconscionable that given the visible and ongoing threat to our democracy, that had it’s most tragic example in the insurrection on January 6, it is unconscionable that we would not treat the protection of our democracy as an absolute good that should be subject to an exemption from the traditional filibuster rule. Every other mechanism will take time. Every other mechanism will require the inevitability of demographic change. This is one piece that will ensure that rather than 100 years of Jim Crow, which is what we had to survive last time Congress abdicated its responsibility with regard to election law, that rather than 100 years of stasis and paralysis and ignominy, that this is an opportunity for us to get it right.

AstraZeneca has been accused by the commission of overselling its ability to deliver doses and reneging on its contract with the EU after delivering less than a quarter of the 120m doses it had promised this quarter. The EU’s executive branch believes the company has unfairly prioritised its contract with the UK government. Following a report in the Italian media that a stockpile of 29m doses had been discovered destined for the UK, AstraZeneca issued a statement dismissing the claim as “inaccurate”. AstraZeneca said no exports were currently planned outside of the EU other than to developing countries via the Covax facility, and it was incorrect to describe the batches in the factory – run by the US-based company Catalent to provide vial filling and packaging – as a “stockpile”. “There are 13m doses of vaccine waiting for quality control release to be dispatched to Covax as part of our commitment to supply millions of doses to low-income countries, the vaccine was made outside the EU and brought to the Anagni plant to be filled into vials,” the company said. A statement from the office of the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, confirmed that the Anagni plant had been inspected at the commission’s request and that batches found were destined for Belgium. La Stampa had reported on Wednesday that the doses – almost twice the amount the EU has so far received from AstraZeneca – were found “hidden” in the factory following a search by Italian police on Saturday at the request of the European commission, and that they were probably destined for the UK. Draghi caused controversy this month after blocking 250,000 AstraZeneca vaccine doses from being exported from the Anagni plant to Australia in response to the company failing to meet its EU delivery targets. It is at least the second time that the commission has asked national authorities to investigate AstraZeneca production facilities. In January, Belgian officials were asked to probe a plant in Seneffe, south of Brussels. EU officials were suspicious of claims by the company that the plant had problems with low yield. It has long been suspected that doses had instead been shipped on a large scale to the UK, a suspicion for which no evidence has yet emerged."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4519127.1616608827!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert students to wear face masks for oral exams after public health outcry","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeaving Cert students will be required to wear face masks during oral exams following a last-minute reversal of official guidance. Photograph: The Leaving Cert students will be required to wear face masks during oral exams following a last-minute reversal of official guidance.The move follows an outcry among teachers and students who argued that not allowing face masks was contrary to public health advice and would place iniduals at risk.The State Examinations Commission (SEC) issued “supplementary guidance” to schools on Wednesday evening which “provide for masks to be worn by candidates and interviewers during the interviews”.Oral exams for tens of thousands of Leaving Cert students are set to get under way in schools during the Easter break between March 26th and April 15th.Guidance issued to schools last Friday evening stated that masks would not be permitted on the basis that they could interfere with clear communication and recordings.However, in a statement, Minister for Education Norma Foley said it was important that both students and staff feel comfortable during the oral exam interviews this year. “In addition to very clear public health advice issued last week, the SEC has introduced a requirement for both interviewer and student to wear face masks during the entirety of the interview, except in cases where students are already exempted from wearing masks,” she said.“I wish all students the very best as they continue to prepare for the oral examinations over the coming weeks.”Public health measures to be put in place by schools hosting exam interviews include the use of Perspex screens, along with social distancing, ventilation, cleaning and sanitation measures.This year, the oral exam interview is being organised by schools. This teacher will ask the questions and conduct the interview, but they will not mark candidates’ performance.Instead, the exams will be recorded on a device and submitted to the SEC for assessment.AlarmThe French Teachers’ Association of Ireland, which raised its concerns directly with the SEC, said it welcomed the announcement.The association said it had received many calls in recent days expressing alarm over the health and safety implications of not allowing students and their teachers to wear face masks.“Those who contacted us expressed huge anxiety and concern that they may transmit the Covid virus to vulnerable members of their household,” the association said on Tuesday, prior to the change in guidance.“They also risked infecting their students. While some teachers can tell their school management about their concerns, others, living in the same community as their students or on part-time contracts, are more hesitant.”"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 184,191 had received their second dose.Some 184,224 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 297,008 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 191,873 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp6,398 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 450\u0026nbspmillion doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.The next categories are: people aged 65-69 years an ill-defined group referred to as “key workers” and people aged 18-64 with certain medical conditions. Next up will be: those living or working in crowded conditions people working in education those aged 55-64 workers in other occupations important to the functioning of society people aged between 18 and 54 and, finally, pregnant women and those under 18.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket should begin to receive their first dose by March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4518386.1616537944!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu showdown looms with uk over 30m astrazeneca doses","story":"British prime minister Boris Johnson has said that his government does not believe in Covid-19 vaccine blockades as both the UK and EU look to secure a stockpile of AstraZeneca vaccines, said to number up to 30 million doses.

Photograph:  Daniel Leal-OlivasAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union is set for a showdown with the United Kingdom over a stockpile of AstraZeneca vaccines, said to number up to 30 million doses, and coveted by both sides to shore up inoculation campaigns, as a deadly wave of infection threatens the continent.Brussels suspects the British-Swedish company of building up a stockpile of the vaccine produced in a Dutch factory and finished in Italy that officials estimate runs into tens of millions of doses that are awaiting delivery.The question is which contract will they go to fulfil after steep shortfalls in AstraZeneca deliveries to the EU slowed the bloc’s rollout, and with Britain also facing a squeeze in its supply that London has blamed on manufacturing delays in India.There have been a flurry of phone calls between the capitals over the fate of the doses as the European Commission draws up proposals to tighten vaccine export controls in a bid to strong-arm AstraZeneca into delivering more vaccines.“We have been discussing with member states, and we intend of course to take action because this is really an issue that cannot be left unattended. We will use all of the tools at our disposal to get the doses.”Export permitUnder the EU’s current vaccine controls, the Italian government and the European Commission have the power to refuse an export permit for vaccines if the company has an unmet contract with the EU but proposes to send them to a list of certain countries including Britain.Rome previously refused a permit for 250,000 AstraZeneca doses that were due to be sent to Australia, the only refusal so far in a permit system under which 41 million Covid-19 vaccines were exported from the bloc since the start of February, a quarter of them to Britain.British prime minister Boris Johnson has lobbied Paris and Berlin over the Dutch-made AstraZeneca doses and has floated a compromise of sharing them, while ruling out blocking the export of components needed to produce Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines as a potential retaliatory move.“We’ll continue to work with European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout. All I can say is that we in this country don’t believe in blockades of any kind, of vaccines or vaccine material,” he told journalists. “It’s not something this country would dream of engaging in and I’m encouraged by some of the things I’ve heard from the continent in the same sense.”The European Commission is expected to propose tightening controls to make it possible to block exports to countries that do not export vaccines to the EU in turn, or that have a higher vaccination rate than the EU.Political pressureThough national governments are under tough political pressure over lagging vaccination campaigns, there are mixed views towards export curbs, with widespread opposition including from Ireland towards any move that could also negatively impact Moderna and Pfizer, which have not had the same delivery shortfalls.AstraZeneca did not respond to a request for comment by time of publication.The company is also in hot water in the United States, where federal health officials and an independent oversight board have accused it of cherry-picking data to overstate the effectiveness of its vaccine in new trial results.AstraZeneca issued a news release on Monday announcing its US trial had found its vaccine to be 79 per cent effective at preventing Covid-19, which boosted its stock price after the temporary suspension of its use in several European countries. But within hours, an independent panel of medical experts, which was overseeing the trial, dramatically rebuffed the announcement, accusing the company of selectively using data to exaggerate an efficacy figure that should have been 69-74 per cent.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4518991.1616601980!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"india detects double mutant coronavirus variant","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEvidence of the new coronavirus variant adds to concern as the government struggles with the highest single-day tally of new infections and deaths this year. Photograph: GettyIndia has detected a “double mutant variant” of the novel coronavirus in 206 samples in the worst-hit western state of Maharashtra, said a senior government official on Wednesday.The new variant was also detected in nine samples in the capital New Delhi, the director of the National Centre for Disease Control, Sujeet Kumar Singh, told a news conference. The development adds to concern as the government struggles with the highest single-day tally of new infections and deaths this year.Genome sequencing and analysis of samples from Maharashtra state found mutations in the virus that do not match previously catalogued “variants of concern” (VOC), said the health ministry.Maharashtra is one of India’s worst-affected states but the ministry said it was unclear if the new variant is causing an upsurge there or in other states.“Though VOCs and a new double mutant variant have been found in India, these have not been detected in numbers sufficient to either establish a direct relationship or explain the rapid increase in cases in some states,” said the ministry.It did not elaborate.India has already reported several cases of a variant first detected in Britain, as well as ones first found in South Africa and Brazil.On Wednesday, India reported 47,262 new infections over the previous 24-hour period, the highest since early November, taking its overall tally to 11.7 million. Only the United States and Brazil have higher caseloads.The number of deaths from Covid-19 in India in the previous 24 hours rose to 275, the most this year, taking the total to 160,441, government data showed.Several states announced a ban on large gatherings ahead of the Hindu festival of Holi this weekend.The health ministry said states were “strongly advised” to restrict public observation of festivals.“Any laxity at this point in ensuring strict adherence . . . to contain the spread of Covid-19, may result in losing the impetus and benefits that our country has gained so far in managing the virus,” said the ministry.Alarmed by the surge, the federal government has announced it is expanding a nationwide inoculation campaign to include everyone above the age of 45 and appealed to people to get vaccinated.Total vaccinations in India rank as world’s third highest.

Photograph: Alan Betson Robert Crilly is hopeful his new Midlands Cycling Hub premises, strategically located at the end of the Royal Canal Greenway in Co Longford, will see tourists pouring his way when it opens this summer. The State’s longest greenway yet, the 130km Royal Canal Greenway from Maynooth in Co Kildare to Cloondara, Co Longford, is to be officially launched by Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan on Wednesday.The towpath route beside the 225-year-old canal passes 90 bridges, 33 locks, 17 harbours and four aqueducts, not to mention dozens of shops, B\u0026ampBs, restaurants and pubs. After Covid-19 restrictions saw Crilly’s cycling hub plans put on hold last year, his hopes are high that his year business will be brisk. The hub is one of dozens of businesses along the route that are very much now hoping for a “greenway idend”. In the first nine months of the opening of the Waterford Greenway in March 2017, there were 250,000 visitors, most of them spending €25-€100 a night. Business in the midlands would be a welcome relief from Covid, says Crilly, who is hoping to offer a route into the famine museum at Strokestown Park House, about 18km away in Co Roscommon. The trail follows the ill-fated journey of 1,490 famine emigrants who walked from Strokestown Park to ships in Dublin in 1847, at the height of the Famine.AccommodationAt Abbeyshrule, Susan Egan of Abbeyview B\u0026ampB, 100 metres from the canal, is investing in “pods” in her grounds.“Because necessity is the mother of invention,” she says, explaining that they are ideal for people who want their own space during Covid-19 as they are socially distanced and have their own kitchenette, bedroom and and en suite facilities. “There was always lots more to do in the area than people thought,” she says, citing a long list including the availability of flying lessons at nearby Abbeyshrule Airfield. Mullingar is about 30km away and offers a route along the Old Rail Trail Greenway into Athlone. The Royal Canal Greenway route also passes well-known isolated hostelries such as Mary Lynch’s where the canal meets the M4 at Coralstown Nanny Quinn’s bar and restaurant near Killucan and Furey’s tin-roofed bar on the edge of the canal at Moyvalley. Also offering bike hire at the eastern end of the canal is Michael Burke who offers cycling tours based out of Enfield or Maynooth, which are just 20km apart. Burke is keen to offer people the opportunity of multiple days hire and will collect bikes at pre-arranged guesthouses along the way. He chose not to open his business during the short period available during Covid restrictions last year. Now he is confident, with the official opening of the Royal Canal Greenway, that this year it will finally get off the ground.

File photograph: Dominic LipinskiPA Wire The author of a report into victims of IRA attacks using Libyan arms has told MPs at Westminster that he cannot reveal its contents, recommendations or terms of reference. William Shawcross said nobody in the British government had sought to speak to him about the 90-page report since he submitted it a year ago. The British government said this week that it cannot use frozen Libyan assets to compensate the victims and that it would not establish a bespoke, taxpayer-funded scheme to do so. Mr Shawcross told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee that he was “surprised and disappointed” by the government’s statement. He said he had not spoken to any victims in Northern Ireland of IRA attacks using Semtex supplied by Col Muammar Gadafy’s regime in Libya. They included the 1987 Remembrance Sunday bombing in Enniskillen, which killed 12 people and injured 63, and the 1996 London Docklands bombing, which killed two people and injured more than 100. “I am aware of course of the agony of people’s expectations in Northern Ireland. It was brought home to me throughout my six months working on this, that the raised expectations and disappointed expectations over this over years and years is a terrible thing in Northern Ireland,” he said. “I had wished and hoped to speak to victims but because it was only a scoping exercise, I was strongly advised from people in Northern Ireland whom I respected, not to approach victims themselves directly...because that would add too much to people’s expectations that I was going to provide a complete answer.” The United States, France and Germany secured millions of euros in compensation from Gadafy’s regime as it emerged from isolation from 2003. But Britain has never received compensation for Libyan-armed IRA attacks despite a long-running campaign by Northern Ireland politicians at Westminster. The British government said this week that international law prohibited it from using £12 billion of frozen Libyan assets to compensate the victims and that there were “clear practical difficulties” in obtaining compensation from Libya’s current government. Gadafy was killed in October 2011.Foreign office minister James Cleverly ruled out using public funds to compensate the victims and recouping the money from Libya later, suggesting that victims turn to existing injury compensation schemes instead. The British Labour Party’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Louise Haigh said after Mr Shawcross’s testimony on Wednesday that the British government had serious questions to answer about its conduct. “Not only have victims of Libyan-sponsored IRA terror been left in the dark, but the author of a key report effectively silenced. The failure of Ministers to provide even the most basic answers to victims is an insult,” she said.

Sick people are still encouraged to contact their doctors.“They are looking for people locally, but if people are willing to come in for a test, they’re asymptomatic – we’re happy to test them,” said Ms Canavan.“We will see how it goes, they will moderate the model depending on how it is going. They are focused on the 5km because the limit of your travel at the moment.”Dr Miriam Owens, director of public health for the HSE’s CHO9 community health area covering north Dublin city and county, said she hoped the centres would “pick up people who don’t overtly have symptoms of Covid-19” and who “wouldn’t necessarily present for testing.”“What we are seeing is people moving around with symptoms and while this is happening, we are not going to get on top of the numbers,” she said.“We are hoping this message will get out to people who are perhaps reluctant to bother a GP and see where things are spreading and prevent them spreading sooner than we ordinarily can.”She described the infection rate in Blanchardstown, Mulhuddart and adjacent areas as “extremely high”, with the new testing centre opening to try to “pinpoint” infections there.Dr Owens described the north Dublin area as “the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic” representing 13 per cent of the country, and up to 22 per cent of cases nationwide.“When you wait for a case to be identified, that person has already infected people, especially if they have been ignoring very mild symptoms,” she said.Walk-ins could be the “worried well” such as people with a headache or a slight temperature or cough, but testing them more quickly could take them out of circulation, she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics interview derek scally author of the best catholics in the world","story":"In today’s episode  Berlin correspondent Derek Scally joins Hugh to speak about his brand new book: The Best Catholics in the World.

Photograph:  Julien Behal PhotographyPA WireThe “eyes and interest” of the United States continue to “make a difference at a delicate time” for post-Brexit Northern Ireland, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.Speaking at a virtual meeting of the traditional Friends of Ireland St Patrick’s Day event, Mr Martin told Irish-American politicians that there has been “deep appreciation of the importance of the balances and nuances” of Northern Ireland’s Belfast Agreement in Washington since Brexit.This was “an appreciation that we do not take for granted”, the Taoiseach said in an address that touched on the tensions caused by Brexit in the North and between the EU and UK.Mr Martin said the Government always knew that the UK’s departure from the EU would “create strains and complications, especially in Northern Ireland”, and that the “voices” of Irish-American politicians within the caucus “helped pave the way” for the Brexit withdrawal deal.The Northern Ireland protocol within that agreement was “an agreed, balanced compromise” and was “the only way” to manage complexities in Northern Ireland and to avoid a hard border.“Implementing the protocol involves change and sometimes it takes time for people to adjust to new ways of doing things. The protocol has only been in operation since the start of the year,” Mr Martin said.“I have always known that there would inevitably be bumps and wrinkles along the way. That is why the agreement itself contains mechanisms through which any difficulties can be resolved.” For the protocol to succeed and deliver benefits for the people of Northern Ireland, there has to be a relationship between the UK and the EU “based on trust and good faith”, he said, in a reference to the tensions over the UK government’s decision to delay border checks for British businesses.Proud memberIn a video address, US president Joe Biden said that he was a proud member of the Friends of Ireland caucus when he was a US senator and paid tribute to his former colleagues who “tended to the flame of Irish-American relationships – a flame that glows ever brighter every single day”.Democratic congressman Richie Neal, a co-chair of the Friends of Ireland group, said in his online remarks that the 1998 Belfast Agreement underpinning the Northern Ireland peace process “remains the only way forward on the island of Ireland – there is simply no plan B”. Mr Biden quoted his favourite poet Seamus Heaney and his poem The Cure at Troy, which he has quoted in public for years, saying: “We have a chance to make hope and history rhyme.” The Friends of Ireland caucus of Irish-American politicians marks its 40th anniversary this year. Normally the Taoiseach would attend the Friends of Ireland St Patrick’s Day lunch alongside the president at the US Capitol – one of only two occasions in Washington’s political calendar when the president travels to Capitol Hill – but the Covid-19 pandemic forced the event online.

Photograph: Clemens BilanEPA Chancellor Angela Merkel ditched a plan agreed on Tuesday for an extended Easter holiday to try to break a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic, apologising to lockdown-weary Germans after the hastily-conceived plan triggered a backlash.At talks that ran into the early hours of Tuesday, Dr Merkel and the leaders of Germany’s 16 states had agreed to call on citizens to stay at home for five days over the Easter holidays, declaring April 1st and April 3rd as extra “rest days”.The measure would have meant all shops, including essential ones, closing for an extra day.“The idea of an Easter shutdown was drafted with the best of intentions. We urgently need to stop and reverse the third wave of the pandemic,” the chancellor said.But it was not possible to implement the hastily agreed measures so quickly, she added, and apologised for added uncertainty that it had raised for Germans.Her comments came against a backdrop of growing public frustration with the conservative-led government over the slow rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and extended lockdown measures.“No plan, no clue, no courage,” ran a headline in the online edition of the mass-selling Bild daily above a picture of Dr Merkel and two state leaders.Dietmar Bartsch, head of the opposition Left Party, called for a vote of no-confidence in Dr Merkel, telling newspapers of the Funke media group: “We now have a veritable crisis of confidence in the political leadership of the country.”A poll released on Wednesday showed support for Dr Merkel’s conservatives slumping to its lowest in over a year ahead of a national election in September. Dr Merkel, who has led Germany since 2005, will stand down before the vote.At the talks earlier this week, Dr Merkel had pushed for a reversal of plans for a gradual re-opening of the economy agreed earlier this month following a sharp rise in the infection rate.But state premiers pushed back, only agreeing to call on citizens to stay at home over the Easter holidays.‘Bit of reasoning’The move drew criticism from all sides, with businesses lamenting the extended lockdown and medical experts saying the new measures were not tough enough to prevent the exponential spread of more infectious variants of the virus.The HDE association of retailers welcomed Dr Merkel’s reversal on Wednesday, noting that closing stores for an extra day ahead of Easter would have led to logistical problems and prompted shoppers to rush to stock up earlier.“With today’s decision, a bit of reason is returning to coronavirus policy,” said HDE president Stefan Genth. The CDU suffered historic defeats in two state elections this month, hit by public frustration over the slow vaccine rollout and the extended lockdown measures, as well as a scandal over the procurement of face masks.The conservative bloc has yet to settle on a chancellor candidate, and is already missing the “Merkel bonus” she has brought them with four consecutive national election victories.Germany, which has a population of 83 million, reported another 15,813 infections on Wednesday, bringing the total to 2,690,523, while the death toll rose by 248 to 75,212.The number of cases per 100,000 in the last seven days, which the government has used as a key metric to decide on lockdown steps, was stable at 108. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4518864.1616593030!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"european commission proposes tougher controls on covid 19 vaccine exports","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference the export authorisation mechanism was not targeting any specific country. Photograph: Stephanie LecocqAFPGetty ImagesThe European Union refined its rules on the export of Covid-19 vaccines on Wednesday, giving it a clearer right to block shipments to countries such as Britain with higher inoculation rates and to those not exporting their own vaccine doses.The move risks stoking post-Brexit tensions with London, which has warned Brussels against “vaccine nationalism”.EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference the export authorisation mechanism was not targeting any specific country.The European Commission, which oversees trade policy for the 27 EU members, set out a proposal expanding existing measures that seek to ensure planned exports by drugmakers do not threaten already reduced EU supply.The granting of export licences will be based on reciprocity and “proportionality” - the epidemiological situation, vaccination rate and access to vaccines in the destination country.EU officials say export restrictions could also kick in if companies do respect quarterly contracts but backload supplies at the end of the period.Mr Dombrovskis said the new rules did not create a detailed algorithm on authorisations and requests would be considered on a case-by-case basis.The scheme will also widen the net to include 17 neighbouring countries, including Israel, Norway and Switzerland. Previously exempted, exports to these countries will also need authorisation.Alarming third waveThe proposal is set to be a topic of discussion on Thursday at an online summit of EU leaders, whose countries are struggling with a third wave of infections that has prompted harder lockdowns amid a slow rollout of vaccines.EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said the situation in many EU countries was “alarming”, with increasing cases in 19 EU members and rising fatalities in eight.While France, Germany and Italy broadly support tighter export curbs on those who do not reciprocate, countries including the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland are more cautious about cutting off Britain.A French presidential adviser said the EU should be not be a sort of “useful idiot” in the battle against the virus.Taoiseach Micheal Martin said any EU restrictions on vaccine exports would be a “retrograde step”.A UK government spokesperson said all countries were fighting the same pandemic and that Britain would continue to work with European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout.The Commission insists it is not an export ban and says priority systems set up for vaccinating citizens in other countries are de facto bans even if they are not called that.The bloc said it had exported 43 million doses to 33 countries since the end of January, including 10.9 million to Britain. Some 380 export requests were granted and only one was blocked - from Italy to Australia.The EU has so far authorised four Covid-19 vaccines. AstraZeneca doses were supposed to be the vaccination for the masses, but deliveries have and will be far lower than initially indicated.EU countries have given a dose to about 10 per cent of their adult populations and have watched Britain provide at least one vaccination to over half of all adults, suffering almost no delivery problems, despite the same plants officially supplying both.The Commission proposal will come into force unless a “qualified majority” of EU members oppose it, which is very unlikely. –ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Covid lockdown roadmap: the key dates for when restrictions will end and what rules will changeCoronavirus latest news: Joint EU-UK statement insists they are working together for \u0026#39win-win\u0026#39 situation on vaccinesVaccine factory raided in Italy after Astrazeneca is falsely accused of hiding 29m doses bound for the UKCovid passports for pubs may be decision for landlords, says Boris JohnsonPolice to review protests after Bristol officers say they are \u0026#39under seige\u0026#39Wednesday evening UK news briefing: EU\u0026#39s beefed up export rules target UKEaster Coronavirus restrictions: what exactly can you do?Parents who pressure teachers over exam grades could see their children disqualifiedScotland\u0026#39s Covid lockdown ban on church services breached human rights, judge rulesPope orders 10 per cent pay cuts for cardinals as Vatican braces for financial deficit Vaccine passport for pubs \u0026#39may be up to landlord\u0026#39, says Boris Johnson  Using Libyan cash to compensate IRA victims could have \u0026#39caused problems\u0026#39 in Northern IrelandComment: Has a solution to Britain\u0026#39s illegal immigration problem been found at last?

This is a moment like none other that we’ve ever seen, and it’s a good moment,” said Ron Daniels, president of the National African American Reparations Commission, after the vote.The council’s aldermen hope Evanston will become a model for other cities and states grappling with whether to pursue their own reparations programs.Growing up in the Fifth Ward, Robin Rue Simmons, who championed the bill, remembers the first time she realised the stark difference between the surrounding neighbourhoods.Visiting a white friend\u0027s home as a child she noticed “the streets were wider. The trees were taller. The homes were bigger and brighter. \u0027My family worked just as hard, why didn’t we live like this?’” she asked herself.Evanston’s first African American residents began arriving in the 1860s following the abolishment of slavery. By the late 1940s, the population had grown and white officials became anxious about the value of their homes.The city began demolishing houses belonging to black residents that were outside of the Fifth Ward, forcing them to move to the redlined boundaries.According to a recent report by local historian Morris “Dino” Robinson, homes in the area had smaller lot sizes, and often went without electricity and water.“There are still realtors who refer to the redlining maps to steer people into certain communities,” Mr Robinson, founder of the Shorefront Legacy Center, which is dedicated to chronicling local black history, told The . “All that\u0027s changed is it just became harder to prove.”Despite the city passing a fair housing law in 1968, estate agents continued to refuse to show black buyers properties outside the triangle, while banks generally refused to loan.Today, about 16 per cent of its 75,000 residents are black and the majority live in the one-square-mile neighbourhood.White people in Evanston make nearly double the income and their homes are worth twice as much as their black neighbours’, according to the most recent US Census. Of the 218 mortgages in Evanston issued by one major bank in 2018, 150 went to whites and 17 to blacks - numbers far out of line with a 65 per cent to 15 per cent split in the population as a whole.“I’m just glad that now there is a recognition that harm was done,” said teacher Sara Diggs, 69, outside the house her grandparents bought in the Fifth Ward in 1941. “Acknowledgment of wrongs done is the first part of healing.It\u0027s not perfect, but no first prototype is. Evanston is making history and we\u0027re part of it, said Ms Diggs, who qualifies for the pay-out.The will to repair the damage caused by America’s so-called original sin has never been greater.Last week, the Jesuit order of Catholic priests pledged $100 million to benefit the descendants of the enslaved people it once owned.Barack Obama came out in February and publicly backed reparations as “justified” - something he said he was unable to do while serving as the country’s first black president.“There’s not much question that the wealth of this country, the power of this country was built in significant part, not exclusively, maybe not even the majority of it, but a large portion of it was built on the backs of slaves,” he said.President Joe Biden’s senior adviser Cedric Richmond has said he was “going to start acting now” by looking into national reparations plans.Mr Biden, who has black voters to thank for his 2020 election win, has himself supported the idea of federal study into reparations, though has not expressed full backing for legislation.Congress has debated a bill that would create a commission to study the reparations issue more closely. The bill, House Resolution 40, was last considered in 2019, and it refers to the Civil War-era broken promise to give former slaves “40 acres and a mule.” The proposal for reparations has found overwhelming support in Evanston, which is known for its liberal politics.The bill passed late Monday night 8-1. The aldermen voted to allow the funding for the reparations to be drawn largely from revenue from a 3 per cent tax the city collects on the sale of recreational cannabis.The sole dissenting city official did not object to reparations in theory but said the current program fails to give residents enough of a say in how they will be distributed.Cicely Fleming, who is black, said the focus on housing confirmed negative stereotypes that the poorest “can’t handle their money” and discriminates against people who may be due reparations but either do not own a home or do not plan to purchase one.Other detractors told The  they do not see housing assistance as a credible form of reparations.“True reparations repair you – you get a chance to say what it is that repairs you,” said Rose Cannon, a member of the group Evanston Rejects Racist Reparations.“There aren’t even houses in Evanston which you can buy with a $25,000 down payment, a lot of people are going to end up being very disappointed,” said Ms Cannon, a 73-year-old resident of the city. “These are absolutely not the reparations we are entitled to.”Outside Evanston, there is still plenty of scepticism about the need for reparations.An Ipsos poll taken in June 2020, at the height of racial justice protests, found only one in five respondents agreed the US should pay damages to descendants of enslaved people.Some opponents ask whether taxpayers can afford to pay out what could be billions, or even trillions, of dollars. Others question how eligibility for such programs would be determined, whether by race, ancestry or evidence of discrimination.It is an issue that has long rankled the Republican Party. Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader, publicly opposed the idea of reparations in 2019, arguing “none of us currently living are responsible” and that electing the first African American president showed the country had moved on.Conservative lawyers in Washington DC have already threatened to sue the city for the program, claiming it is “racially discriminatory”, “unfair” and “unconstitutional”.But this has done little to dampen Evanston’s day.In the Fifth Ward on Tuesday, many were quietly celebrating. “It may be a small step, but it’s what it symbolises,” said Ms Diggs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ethical questions around covid vaccination children","story":"For more than a year, Britain has faced one ethical dilemma after another. Should the most vulnerable be expected to stay home so the rest of society can function more normally?  How can the balance be struck against protecting human life and supporting the economy to sustain it?Now ministers are facing one of the most controversial questions of all. Should children be vaccinated?Unlike many common viruses – and the diseases for which children are routinely immunised – Covid has largely spared children from its direct effects, causing few fatalities or severe cases across the population. Yet health officials are nevertheless contemplating whether it could be necessary – and ethical – to recommend routine Covid vaccination of the under-18s. If trials, now ongoing, show the jabs are safe and effective, the programme could be rolled out as soon as August, government sources say. Prof Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the Bristol Children\u0027s Vaccine Centre, is one of the scientists involved in the research.  Stressing that no decision has been made – nor will be until there are results from trials – he says any case for vaccinating children would not be based on the threat infection poses to them. Instead, vaccination of under-18s would be an attempt to reduce their role transmitting the virus and thus bolster herd immunity across the population, says Prof Finn, a member of the Government\u0027s joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (JCVI).He told The : You are left with an ethical question, whether it is ok to immunise children for the benefit of adults. But in fact given that schools being closed has done the greatest harm to children, and that vaccinating children would help to keep schools open, I think there is an ethical case.If a Covid vaccine were to be given to children it might seem logical to do so at schools, which already deal with jabs for flu, MMR and HPV, which protects against cervical cancer. Normally we do immunisations at school, as it\u0027s the best way to get good coverage, but obviously we are in exceptional times so nothing is a given, says Prof Finn.Current preparations are about covering all the bases, he says, so that if the decision was taken to roll out jabs to children, the system is able to do so. The Government\u0027s current schedule says all adults should have been offered their first vaccine by the end of July. At this point, if the programme is extended, a choice may need to be made between two key competing priorities, the old and the young.Government scientists have said booster jabs – a third dose – are likely to be needed to protect against new Covid variants. Earlier this month, Professor Anthony Harnden, the acting chairman of the JCVI, suggested that this could be rolled out in August or September rather than later in the year, because of this worry about a large third wave affecting the vulnerable elderly.He told the British Medical Journal: I think we\u0027re likely to make a bold decision to recommend a booster dose, even if we haven\u0027t got all the evidence of the necessity, just because I think the consequences of not immunising with the booster dose are so big. If it\u0027s proved that it\u0027s needed months later, it may be too late.But this week Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, suggested booster jabs would be more likely to be offered later in the year. Potentially, this could leave a crucial window in which children are offered the jab, with government sources suggesting this could come as soon as August. Sir Patrick told a Downing Street press conference on Tuesday: There will be a need to think about booster jabs for vaccines in the autumn I suspect, particularly thinking about getting a high level of immunity to cover things over the winter.So far, in Britain’s vaccine rollout, the focus has been on the most vulnerable. Offering jabs to all over-50s covers the groups which account for 99 per cent of all Covid deaths.But amid growing concern that a third wave will wash up from our shores” from Europe and provide a breeding ground for new variants, arguments that a strategy to push for maximum immunity across the population – including children – are growing louder. Last month, Prof John Edmunds, of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said children should be vaccinated against Covid as fast as we can to prevent a rise in new infections after lockdown is lifted. Prof Edmunds said there was a significant risk of a resurgence of the virus until everyone in the country, including children, had been vaccinated.Parents may also look at it in a wider family context – that vaccinating children may also be the best way to protect granny. Scientists have pointed out that even if all elderly people have two doses of vaccine, protection levels of between 82 and 95 per cent mean some will remain exposed to danger. New variants may reduce the effectiveness of jabs, further increasing this gap. Nevertheless, while trials of Covid vaccines for children have been inundated by families keen to sign up, some parents may feel uneasy about the prospect of giving children jabs which are not about their direct clinical protection. Prof Finn is involved in a key clinical trial by the University of Oxford, testing the safety and efficacy of the OxfordAstrazeneca jab on 300 children aged between six and 17.The study started last month with children at the upper end of the range. Safety data is expected shortly, before the programme extends to younger children, and efficacy data is expected by summer.On Tuesday, Prof Finn said that if the rollout of vaccines is extended to children, it is likely to start with teenagers. Israel, the country with the highest proportion of vaccinated citizens globally, is already giving jabs to 16- and 17-year-olds.If it does turn out to be necessary to immunise children, I think it is more likely that we would prioritise teenagers over younger children, simply because the evidence we have at the moment is that transmission of the virus is more likely to occur from and between teenagers – who are a little bit more like adults,” Prof Finn said. But he added that evidence is needed about what proportion of the population requires immunisation to produce effective herd immunity and suppress circulation of the virus.We need to have a clear understanding of how efficiently the vaccines actually interrupt infection and transmission, and that evidence is still on its way, he said. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: While clinical trials are under way to test the efficacy and safety of Covid-19 vaccines in children and young adults, these trials have not concluded yet. We will be guided by the advice of our experts on these issues, including the independent JCVI.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eu targets uk vaccine export ban aimed countries high vaccination","story":"Brussels on Wednesday targeted Britain with beefed up rules to impose vaccine export bans on countries with higher vaccination rates than the EU. Britain has far outstripped the EU in vaccination, giving a first dose to more than half its adult population. The bloc, in the grip of a third Covid wave, has so far managed only 12 per cent. The European Commission – which has faced criticism as frustration at the slow rollout mounts in Europe – said the revised vaccine transparency mechanism would also target countries that manufactured coronavirus jabs but did not export them to the EU. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU\u0027s trade commissioner, said the EU had exported about 10.9 million vaccines, mostly from the Belgian Pfizer plant, to the UK, but Britain had not sent any jabs to the bloc. So if we discuss reciprocity, solidarity, global responsibility, it\u0027s clear that we also need to look at those aspects of responsibility and proportionality, he said.  Brussels is furious with AstraZeneca after the company announced a string of supply shortfalls of millions of doses. Pharmaceutical companies failing to meet contractual obligations are also targeted in the revisions to rules forcing manufacturers to ask the commission for permission to export outside the bloc. Mr Dombrovskis and Stella Kyriakides, the EU health commissioner, denied the ban was a punishment for Britain\u0027s vaccination success as Belgium announced a new intensified lockdown. But asked by The  which country could be hardest hit by the measure, Mr Dombrovskis gave the UK as an example. The trade commissioner also did not deny that Pfizer exports to Britain could be blocked, which could spark a vaccine trade war if the UK retaliates by blocking exports of raw materials to Pfizer. He said decisions would be made on a case by case basis according to the new criteria. Ms Kyriakides said: We\u0027re dealing with a pandemic and this is not seeking to punish any countries. We are the strongest supporters of global solidarity.The commission has already threatened to block the export of millions of AstraZeneca vaccines from the company\u0027s Halix plant in Leiden, the Netherlands, to the UK. Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, wants Boris Johnson to release AstraZeneca from its contractual agreement of first refusal on supplies from the company\u0027s two British factories so it can supply the bloc. The commission argues that its contract with AstraZeneca counts the two factories as EU suppliers. The Halix factory cannot currently supply the EU, pending regulatory clearance from the European Medicines Agency. The new rules were revealed ahead of an EU summit on Thursday, at which the bloc\u0027s 27 leaders will discuss possible export bans amid UK-EU negotiations to try and avoid the ban. If leaders back them, they are expected to come into force soon afterwards and last for six weeks. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, on Tuesday ruled out a blanket ban on vaccine exports but said she supported Mrs von der Leyen\u0027s targeted ban on AstraZeneca. Germany, along with France and Italy, has strengthened its lockdown, and Berlin is putting pressure on the European Commission to buy Russian Sputnik vaccines to ramp up vaccinations. Mr Johnson is understood to be prepared to share vaccine supplies from the Halix factory as UK officials try to convince Brussels to drop the threat.  Britain also wants its investment in developing the AstraZeneca vaccine to be taken into account in any deal with Brussels. The commission turned down a British offer of trilateral talks with AstraZeneca to find a solution to the stand-off, arguing that it was not possible because Brussels had begun legal action against the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company.A Government spokesperson said: We are all fighting the same pandemic and we will continue to work with our European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout.  We remain confident in our supplies and are on track to offer first doses to all over-50s by April 15 and all adults by the end of July.Italy became the first country to trigger the vaccine export mechanism, introduced in January in the opening salvos of the EU\u0027s row with AstraZeneca, and blocked 250,000 of the firm\u0027s jabs from being exported to Australia earlier this month.Italian authorities raided a vaccine factory amid fears that 29 million AstraZeneca jabs meant for developing countries and Belgium were hidden supplies intended for the UK, it emerged on Wednesday.The commission said it had received 380 export requests to 33 different destinations for a total of around 43 million doses and had granted all except the one shipment to Australia.The new rules also remove exemptions for non-EU members such as Norway and Switzerland, as well as Israel and Serbia, which have far outstripped the bloc in vaccinations. Developing countries that are part of the Covax vaccination programme remain exempt from the mechanism, which the commissioners insisted was not an export ban. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eu vaccine posturing cant disguise fact continent faces catastrophic","story":"Only a small minority of Europeans have yet contracted Covid-19 or been vaccinated against it. Given this fact, and how highly transmissible the virus is, this means there is now another wave of infections on the Continent. Desperate attempts to extend restrictions are being met by lockdown fatigue. Recriminations abound as the hospitals fill and the death toll mounts.No wonder, then, that there is an effort to shift blame. More widespread vaccination could have been the answer but the EU did not start early enough. Legend on the Continent has it that AstraZeneca has met its supply schedule to the UK but is behind in supplying the EU. This is simply untrue. AstraZeneca got way behind here as well.Last May, when the UK made its original agreement with the firm, we were supposed to receive 30 million doses during 2020. By September the production schedule was so behind that this had been downgraded to 4 million. In the end we didn’t begin rolling out the AstraZeneca vaccine until January 2021 (and indeed still seem not to have received 30 million even now). That lag did affect us – badly. If we had been able to start vaccinating millions of people per week in November, far fewer would have died in our DecemberJanuary wave.The EU now faces similar AstraZeneca production delays at Continental plants. It is not for the UK, having already had its supply severely delayed and many people die as a result, to have its supply slowed even further.There is talk of the EU blocking Dutch AstraZeneca exports to Britain. We do not currently get supply from the Netherlands, though reportedly we might do so in the future. More careless EU talk of banning Pfizer exports has taken a back seat, as the company pointed out publicly that its EU production relies on materials supplied from the UK, so the EU is in no position to commandeer that supply chain.None of these bans is likely to be implemented to an extent that aims at anything more than symbolism. Really they represent efforts by EU leaders to signal to their citizens that vaccine delays are not their fault and that the perfidious British are in some vague way to blame. One doubts such meaningless posturing will be of much comfort to European citizens as they face more lockdowns and prolonged risk of hospitalisation or death.In Britain the headlines scream that we face the risk of a third wave imported from Europe. But with half our population going to have received one dose of an incredibly effective vaccine by the end of this month, with 25-30 per cent of us already having had the disease, and with strong restrictions in place even after we start easing lockdown, there is no real risk of this, barring a vaccine-escaping variant.We may feel the political and economic implications of the Continent’s third wave, however: fewer exports for our firms, financial spillovers (if a new Eurozone crisis were to occur, for example). It may disrupt sports events here this summer (the European Football Championship), and our holiday plans. But as matters stand we face very little disease risk from there.The vaccines work against all known variants. The evidence is that they are almost miraculously effective at stopping the disease causing serious ill-health, amazingly effective at preventing transmission, and that even onward transmission is likely to be impeded for those few vaccinated people who do become ill. Even with the disruption of imports from India and threats of blockades from the EU, Boris Johnson remains so confident that we will meet our target of vaccinating all adults by the end of July that he repeated it yesterday.If the UK had opened up a little more from March 8, if the EU had not been so belligerent about vaccines, and if EU leaders had not so effectively spread anti-vaxxer myths about the AstraZeneca vaccine (and consequently damaged EU citizens\u0027 trust in it), there might well be pressure in the UK for us to send vaccines to help out Europe. It would have been reasonable to ask: Why are we vaccinating healthy 30-year-olds when 80-year-old Spanish, French and Czech citizens are dying? But there is now no argument for our risking any Summer exit wave of hospitalisations in Britain (even if it ought to be modest and manageable) by sending vaccines to the Continent that it simply will not use.Europe\u0027s third wave is a tragedy, and we may face political, economic and cultural consequences. But it presents no current disease threat to us, no threat of disrupting our roadmap to relaxation, and, sadly, our ability to help is limited: even if we were to put our own citizens at greater risk by sending vaccines to the Continent, Europe\u0027s leaders seem incapable of using them. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"israel could heading right wing government history","story":"Benjamin Netanyahu has failed to emerge as the clear winner of Tuesday night’s elections, raising the prospect of him relying on hardline religious movements to secure a coalition government.Initial results show that the prime minister’s Likud party has won the largest number of seats but is set to fall short of the 61 seats required for a majority in the fourth election in Israel in two years. It means that Mr Netanyahu may need to court the hard-Right Religious Zionism group and possibly newcomer Islamist movement Ra’am - among others -  in coalition talks that are expected to be a complex, lengthy process. An alliance with Religious Zionism would be controversial as it includes the far-Right party Otzma Yehudit - Jewish Power in Hebrew - whose leader has expressed admiration for a mass-murderer who gunned down 29 Palestinians in the early 1990s.Itamar Ben Gvir, whose faction is set to enter the Israeli parliament for the first time, is notorious for displaying a picture of the killer, Baruch Goldstein, in his living room. He has also called for the deportation of Arab-Israeli citizens who are not loyal to Israel. Mr Ben Gvir agreed to take down the inflammatory photograph in January after criticism from Naftali Bennett, another prominent right-winger. Goldstein committed the murders in 1994 in Hebron and since then his grave has become a pilgrimage site of sorts for Jewish extremists. Mr Ben Gvir has not yet confirmed if he would be willing to join forces with Mr Netanyahu. But the Religious Zionism movement his party is part of is projected to win around seven seats, which could prove decisive in building a coalition. On the other end of of the spectrum, the Arab Islamist party Ra’am - otherwise known as the United Arab List - could also prove to be an important player, for either Mr Netanyahu or an alliance of anti-Netanyahu parties.Initial results say Ra’am, which supports the two-state solution and the creation of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, is set to meet the threshold for entering the Israeli parliament.Whoever reaches out to us, we will work with them, leader Mansour Abbas told reporters yesterday.However, he has insisted he “isn’t in the pocket” of Mr Netanyahu or his enemies. There are also reports of tensions in Likud, Mr Netanyahu’s party, as to whether it should join forces with Islamists to produce a government. Even so, the results suggest that fervently religious Jewish and Muslim factions may end up playing a key role in talks on who will become Israel’s next prime minister. Tuesday night’s election was widely regarded as a referendum on Mr Netanyahu, who is facing a corruption trial but has also won plaudits for his high-speed vaccinations campaign. But, much like previous polls, the results are showing a mixed picture and may yet lead to a fifth election being called later this year. Yesh Atid, the main rival to Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party, is set to win around 15 seats and maintains hopes of building a coalition against Israel’s longest serving prime minister. This would likely require support from left-wing parties such as Labor, as well as the Blue and White faction led by Benny Gantz, which failed to unseat Mr Netanyahu last year. The results were also disappointing for right-wing rivals of Mr Netanyahu, who hoped to finally step out of his shadow. Gideon Sa’ar, the leader of the new party New Hope, is only set to secure around five seats and has firmly ruled out a coalition with Mr Netanyahu. Meanwhile Naftali Bennett, the leader of Yamina, is projected to win seven seats, a lower result than he hoped but one that may potentially allow him to prop up the Likud party. This suggests that Mr Netanyahu, known to his supporters as “Bibi,” continues to be Israel’s most popular right-wing leader by a wide margin, despite the uncertainty of the results. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"snps incompetence now record remains accountable no one","story":"The Scottish Conservatives made a strategic blunder last week when they announced, even before the report by the Salmond inquiry committee had been published, that they would table a motion of no confidence in the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon.Perhaps they thought there was some kind of race between them and Scottish Labour to see which of the main opposition parties would be first to hit the no-confidence button, assuming that the winner would earn the loyalty and support of a swathe of voters sick of the SNP government.But what is the point in such a vote if you know in advance you’re going to lose? And the motion was always going to fall, even with the support of Labour MSPs, who chose yesterday to abstain. The SNP may not have a majority on its own, but the Scottish Greens can always be relied upon to support the nationalists. Even if the report by James Hamilton had concluded that Sturgeon had not only broken the ministerial code but had set fire to it and danced maniacally on its smoking cinders while filming it all on TikTok, she would have won a vote of confidence with the support of her Green friends.But there is no need for another interminable inquiry to add to the three that have only recently been completed. There was the Hamilton report, of course, which found that Sturgeon had indeed given misleading statements to MPs during the inquiry into how the Scottish government handled complaints against the former first minister, Alex Salmond – but she didn’t mean to, so that was alright.Before that there was the report by Laura Dunlop QC into the Scottish Government’s handling of the harassment complaints and how the process could be improved. This concluded that the system adopted by civil servants was flawed because Salmond himself was not allowed to defend himself.And coming in between those two reports were the conclusions of the Holyrood committee set up to investigate how the Scottish Government came to make such a hash of that internal inquiry into the allegations against Salmond. SNP spin doctors, and the First Minister herself, have done a wonderful job in undermining the credibility of this report, drawn up by a cross-section of MSPs from all the parties represented at Holyrood. Its findings, therefore, have drawn less attention than they should have, particularly because the Hamilton report was published on the same day – a helpful, though no doubt entirely coincidental confluence of events.Contrary to what is now received wisdom, the committee report is not only damning of the Scottish Government and its leadership, but most of its conclusions were arrived at via cross-party consensus.The MSPs are particularly critical of Leslie Evans, the chief civil servant in the administration, for the role she played in devising and implementing the initial inquiry into the complaints brought by two women against Salmond after he left office. The committee said it was “astonishing” that no one thought to challenge the appointment of a lead investigating officer who had previously offered support to the two women. This was the key aspect of the inquiry which was successfully challenged by Salmond in court, at a cost of £500,000 to the public purse.It was decisions by Evans’s office that led to delays in handing over key documents that would have exposed this flaw in the internal inquiry – a delay that ratcheted up the cost of the legal fight against Salmond. “This inidual failing is as significant as the general corporate failing,” the MSPs concluded.Sturgeon has spent a good deal of time reasserting her confidence in Evans. How could she not? Given the level of criticism aimed at her, the First Minister would either have to defend her or dismiss her. And the latter course would stick in her craw, partly out of pride but more because losing Evans would look to the outside world like an admission of guilt and a willingness to sacrifice others for her own sake.Sturgeon and her supporters will claim that the fact there have been no resignations is proof that this whole controversy has been about nothing. But the facts disprove such an assertion. The level of incompetence and duplicity by the Scottish Government is clear, indisputable and on the record. But accountability? This is a notion that is apparently unworthy of being applied to nationalist politicians or their incompetent civil servants.This is what happens when any administration is reinforced by an uninterrupted, unassailable polling lead and is guaranteed re-election, whatever it does, however it behaves. SNP partisans might rejoice, but no true democrat can look at what has happened at Holyrood in the last two years and conclude that Scotland is the better for it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"suez canal blocked huge container ship pictures","story":"The Suez Canal in Egypt was blocked on Tuesday after a massive container ship ran aground.Traffic through the busy waterway was halted in both directions by the 400-metre long and 59 metre-wide cargo ship.The blockage caused a pile-up of at least 100 vessels seeking to transit between the Red Sea and Mediterranean, according to ship brokers and mapping data compiled by BloombergThe play’s the thing: Coronavirus kills the interval at Shakespeare’s GlobeCovid lockdown roadmap: the key dates for when restrictions will end and what rules will changeCoronavirus latest news: Joint EU-UK statement insists they are working together for \u0026#39win-win\u0026#39 situation on vaccinesVaccine factory raided in Italy after Astrazeneca is falsely accused of hiding 29m doses bound for the UKCovid passports for pubs may be decision for landlords, says Boris JohnsonPolice to review protests after Bristol officers say they are \u0026#39under seige\u0026#39Wednesday evening UK news briefing: EU\u0026#39s beefed up export rules target UKEaster Coronavirus restrictions: what exactly can you do?Parents who pressure teachers over exam grades could see their children disqualifiedScotland\u0026#39s Covid lockdown ban on church services breached human rights, judge rulesPope orders 10 per cent pay cuts for cardinals as Vatican braces for financial deficit Vaccine passport for pubs \u0026#39may be up to landlord\u0026#39, says Boris Johnson  Using Libyan cash to compensate IRA victims could have \u0026#39caused problems\u0026#39 in Northern IrelandComment: Has a solution to Britain\u0026#39s illegal immigration problem been found at last?

Container ships account for more than half of total traffic, with some among the largest in the world.Typically, ships from the Gulf to Europe carry oil, and ships from Europe and North American haul grain and manufactured goods eastwards.Ten per cent of all international trade passes through the canal, which revolutionised global shipping when it first opened in 1869.Today, a ship can halve its journey between ports in the Gulf and London by going through the Suez rather than around the southern tip of Africa.The government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi completed a major expansion of the canal in 2015, allowing it to accommodate the world\u0027s largest vessels.However, the Ever Given ran aground before that new portion of the canal.The incident Tuesday marks just the latest to affect mariners amid the pandemic. Hundreds of thousands have been stuck aboard vessels due to the pandemic. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"charities blast priti patels inhumane","story":"NewsCharities blast Priti Patels inhumane plans to overhaul immigration rulesThe Home Secretary vowed to tackle \"illegal migration head-on\" as with a shake-up of asylum rules - but campaigners expressed alarm at plansmirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsPriti Patel announced plans to overhaul immigration rules in a bid to stem the numbers of people making the perilous trip across the Channel \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed to tackle illegal migration head-on as she announced the most signicant overhaul of our asylum system in decades. The “New Plan for Immigration” was comprehensive, fair but firm, she told the Commons. Ms Patel hopes it will stem the flow of migrants making the perilous journey across the English Channel in inflatables. Last year about , reached UK shores, with most claiming asylum. The backlog of cases has hit ,, with , awaiting an initial decision, she told MPs. Ms Patel said: The persistent failure to enforce our immigration rules with a system that is open to gaming by economic migrants and exploitation by criminals is eroding public trust and disadvantaging vulnerable people who need our help. People who arrive in the UK illegally will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive legally. The aim is to deter migrants from turning to ruthless smugglers who traffic them to Britain for thousands of pounds. Gangs who organise crossings face le sentences. But Safe Passage International chief executive Beth Gardiner-Smith said: “These proposed reforms will do nothing to prevent dangerous Channel crossings, whilst making the lives of many who have fled war and persecution a misery.” Mike Adamson, chief executive of the British Red Cross said: We agree the asylum system needs reform, but this announcement takes the system backwards not forwards. We should not judge how worthy someone is of asylum by how they arrived here. The proposals effectively create an unfair two-tiered system, whereby someoneaposs case and the support they receive is judged on how they entered the country and not on their need for protection. This is inhumane. Amnesty International UK director Kate Allen said: “For years, Home Office ministers under successive administrations have demonised people who have come to this country to work, study, join family or seek asylum in a blind and unattainable pursuit of control without any semblance of compassion or humanity. “What we really need is for the Home Office to end this harmful pattern which is doing untold damage to people caught up in its systems while increasingly presenting the UK as firmly on the side of abusers, exploiters and oppressors rather than their victims.” The cost of Britainaposs asylum system is expected to rocket by £million this year, from about £m in   to £.bn in  , the plan shows. The blueprint also reveals a consultation will be launched on the “introduction of a new penalty for failure to secure a vehicle, regardless of whether an illegal migrant is found on board or not”. The Home Office moved to quell fears families ing from the Continent could be targeted for leaving a touring caravan door unlocked. A spokesman said: The focus of the enforcement of these measures will be hauliers who do not take appropriate measures to prevent illegal entry into the UK.” Despite claims last week that asylum seekers could be sent to Gibraltar or the Isle of Man while claims are processed, the -page document failed to mention either the Rock or the Crown Dependency.

The winter that just passed was harsh and long because our inidual need to be social, to be in public, to interact with others through touch and through close contact were frozen over by the pandemic. After more than  days of on-off lock downs, partial reopening’s and civilian death counts not seen outside of warzones, we long for the familiarity of dinners with friends and family, Friday drinks at the pub, the leisure to watch live sports or attend concerts, with thousands of other enthusiasts. We desire our dance to the music of time to resume, so we can forget the brevity of our encounter with existence. However, society faces a grave danger that it will become trapped into accepting as normal many of the daily inequities the vulnerable, the marginalised and the working poor already encounter in exchange for theof ordinary pleasures. There is a good chance we will forget the suffering of others when our normal activities resume and dismiss the plight of rough sleepers, benefits recipients and refugee applicants as not our concern. It’s why I know my dad Harry Leslie Smith - who because of his advocacy for the vulnerable was called the world’s oldest rebel by the press before he died in  at  - would have been against yesterday’s day of reflection for the dead of Covid . My father learned early in le that national reflection without definite action by our leaders is performative politics at its worst. Late in his le he recalled that as a boy he watched on news reels memorials being erected by councils, all across the country in the s and s, to the fallen of the Great War.  Yet, he bitterly reflected that he encountered during his family’s odyssey of poverty during the Great Depression many of the survivors of the bloody battles at the Somme or Passchendaele living truncated lives in near starvation in doss houses or on the streets. It’s why when he saw David Cameron’s Tory government in  employ austerity to smash away at the Welfare State which his generation had created out of the ashes of the Second World War that he took his last stand against the normalisation of poverty and social inequality. For the next eight years, he fought against xenophobia the politics of hate, austerity as well as economic and social inequality by writing books, doing speaking tours and hosting a podcast.What is your view  Have your say in the comment section His le is an example to us all that an ordinary person can inspire change. You see, before my father became a public figure, he was just a normal pensioner with limited means that liked to winter in Portugal and putter around his garden in Spring. But the circumstances of our times reminded him too much of the era of his youth when the politics of hate turned so rancid that the world plunged itself into war to defeat fascism. My father died in  long before Britain was shuttered by Covid like a high street shop at pm on a Sunday. But he would have seen this pandemic as a watershed moment for Britain and for the world. From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here.  My father would have seen this as the time where politics must not only be hopeful but ground-breaking like the Labour politics he embraced, with joy, as a young man at the end of the Second War. That was an era when the Labour party didn’t reflect the times but defined it by rebuilding a Britain to hold and reward the aspirations of the working class rather than the entitled classes. In this time now of reflection when many are still dying from Covid, we must demand of our politicians that they show courage and vision and institute a new Beveridge Report for the st century.

Most of the police realise that, but the government consists of people who are stupid, and populist, which means giving them a riot is like offering Dreamies to the Downing Street cat. Theyaposll bite your arm right off.Every single person who demonstrated peacefully against the new law, which is aimed at curbing proteststhey raise even a risk of noise disturbance or inconvenience, did a grand job, and it was utterly nullied by the far smaller number of people who went out after dark looking for a fight with the bizzies.  Riots almost always happen after dark, because the people that usually start them tend to be nocturnal, and drunk. Any government can survive them. The main reason the poll tax riots of  led to Margaret Thatcheraposs downfall was because they happened in daylight, and sobriety. Thataposs the sort of anger governments cannot ignore.One of the most terrying things I saw while reporting on riots  was in  when a woman of about  in Trafalgar Square set light to a copy of Margaret Thatcheraposs autobiography as a crowd cheered. The refusal to learn, and the urge to destroy, were precisely Thatcheraposs problem, and that young woman had no idea she was doing exactly the same. Burning books spreads ignorance, and sometimes it doesnapost need to go that far.Thinking, on the other hand, is always instructive. And there are several brilliant, far more effective ways of protesting a government whose policies you despise. . Vote in local elections  In just over  weeks time, every adult over the age of  who isnapost in jail will have the right to select local councillors, city mayors, and perhaps most importantly, Police and Crime Commissioners.Only about half of those who vote in general elections bother to express an opinion in local ones. So this one third of law-abiding adults gets to choose, for all of us, how often the roads are resurfaced, where new houses are built, how often the bins are emptied, and whether your elderly mum gets social care visits in her own home.The PCCs are supposed to be the voice of the people, and hold Chief Constables to account. Soyouaposre angry about what the police have been up to, vote for a dferent PCC, rather than kick a cop car. This is only the third time their roles have been up for election, and it was postponed from last May because of the pandemic. If any elected official feels safe in their job, democracy suffers, so go and shake their tree. Not voting is not an option. . Be more Gandhi  In  Mohandas Gandhi led  people on a -day, -mile march to protest the Salt Tax. It was levied by the British government on any Indian who collected or made salt, and produced % of the Rajaposs tax revenue. Gandhi said salt was vital for le, and with a hand-picked band of supporters walked from village to village, making salt as he went. It sparked copycat peaceful protests across the sub-continent, with many women finding their voices for the first time. Soldiers were ordered to open fire on non-violent protesters, but they refused and were jailed instead. Gandhiaposs simple act of civil disobedience provoked a response that could not be stopped. The government was confused by protesters who would not fight, and had no way to tackle them.  Tank Man did more to show up the Chinese government in Tiananmen Square than any other protester. The Berlin Wall was toppled, eventually, by people armed with garden spades and holding candles. And when the peasants revolted in , sacking the Savoy, burning the Temple and breaking open prisons, Richard II had no qualms - and no problems - having Wat Tyler slaughtered and rioters hanged across half of England.One person, doing one peaceful thing, has more power than any army. And think how flummoxed Pratty Patel would be,just one person told her, calmly, that she was wrong. . Spread the word  You might be angry about the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. But you have almost certainly not read it, and most people in your family probably have even less of a clue whataposs in it. It not only outlaws a protest by one person with a megaphone on the basis of noise nuisance, but imposes a maximum -year jail sentence for damaging a statue. Whether they would apply that as firmly to an effigy of Emmeline Pankhurst as they would to one of Winston Churchill, who as Home Secretary oversaw violent police crackdowns on suffragettes, no-one yet knows. But it also increases sentences for child murderers, gives more community sentences for less serious crimes, and has measures to tackle sex abusers who work in positions of trust, like teachers or sports coaches. You wonapost win support to kill the bill, when most reasonable people will like bits of it. Which is probably why theyaposve done it.Talk instead about the march from Selma, the Arab Spring, the Womenaposs March, even the pro and anti-Brexit protests. They would all have been illegal under this law, along with suffragettes chaining themselves to railings, or the Jarrow Marchers who just wanted a job.One of the most dystopian clauses is that a person commits a crimethey do not follow rules they have not been told about. Tell people about that, and then ask themthey know what all the rules are.

MPs will vote on the legislation on Thursday to underpin Boris Johnsonaposs roadmap out of lockdown and pave the way for ongoing restrictions to our daily lives. The national lockdown expires on March  and the new legislation is designed to enshrine the Prime Ministeraposs four-step lockdown exit plan in law. But the Government is facing concern from Tory backbenchers over being asked to extend some lockdown powers until October - despite plans for ato normality in June. While the legislation is expected to pass on Thursday with Labouraposs backing, the PM will be braced for anger from his own MPs about the continuation of tough restrictions amid positive signs over the impact the vaccine rollout. The new laws do not mean that the roadmap out of lockdown is changing. They give the Government the legal powers to enact the four-step plan which Mr Johnson has already set out. Hereaposs what the legislation says and what it means.Why is the law changing New regulations will effectively override the old tier system, which still forms the basis of the laws behind lockdown.Known as the Health Protection Coronavirus, Restrictions Regulations , the rules will replace tiers with a series of steps based on the proposed dates of the PMaposs roadmap out of lockdown for England.The change is needed now because lockdown ends in law on March , so something is needed to replace it. The new legislation expires on June . Separately, MPs will also be asked to renew the emergency powers in the Coronavirus Act, which covers support packages like furlough and business loan schemes, as well as allowing courts to use video technology. MPs must vote to extend these powers every six months, meaning the next vote could be in October. Does it mean lockdown will last until October No. The Government says it wants to keep the Coronavirus Act in place for now to ensure it can respond to pandemic effectively. This does not affect the Prime Ministeraposs plan to ease lockdown measures. However Tory MPs have expressed concern that the sweeping powers could remain in place so long after lockdown is supposed to have ended. The separate roadmap regulations end on June , in line with the Governmentaposs plan to ease restrictions after June . That is the expiry date for the legislation but the Government can scrap or amend itnecessary. The restrictions must be reviewed by April  and at least once every  days afterwards. Mr Johnson has repeatedly said he wants the lting of measures to be irreversible - hence the cautious attitude to unlocking. The Government doesnapost want to be in a situation like after the second lockdown in November when strict measures had to be reimposed again quickly due to a spike in cases.  Is there anything new in the legislation  Most of the fine print matches up with the Prime Ministeraposs roadmap out of lockdown . One eye-catching element was a ban on foreign holidays, with £, fines for anyone who breaks the rules. There is also a £ fixed penalty notice for failing to fill in a travel declaration form to explain your reasons for going abroad. The travel ban does not apply to those going to the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland - unless that is not the final destination. So you canapost travel to Dublin to catch a flight from there. Exemptions also apply including for those needing to travel for work, study, for legal obligations or to vote,they are moving, selling or renting property, for some childcare reasons or to be present at a birth, to visit a dying relative or close friend, to attend a funeral, for those getting married or to attend the wedding of a close relative, for medical appointments or to escape a risk of harm. At present, this is due to last until the restrictions expire on June  but the Government could speed that up when it considers a review of foreign travel next month. Protests will be allowed again as an exemption to rules banning group gatherings. They must be organised by a business, public or political body or other group and organisers must take the required precautions, which is likely to include measures like ensuring people wear face masks and are socially distanced.  So what is the timetable for lting lockdown  England’s restrictions will ease in four stages, startingon March , April , May  and June . Step  began on March , with the reopening of schools and a slight easing of restrictions to let people meet one other person outside for a coffee or a picnic. The second part of Step  is due on March , which will allow up to six people to meet outdoors but restricts indoor gatherings of two or more people. Some outdoor sports are permitted, and open air facilities like swimming pools and tennis courts can reopen.  The stay-at-home order will end. People will be asked to stay local but it wonapost be compulsory. You will be allowed to leave home for non-essential reasons and use public transport. Step , which could come into effect from April , is when non-essential shops can reopen as well as hairdressers, gyms, zoos, theme parks and libraries. Pubs and other hospitality venues will be able to serve customers outside - but rules around social contact remain in place, so rule of six or two households. Holidays in the UK are allowed with your household, as long as its in self-contained accommodation Weddings can take place with up to  people. Step , after May , allows groups of six to meet inside and up to  people outside.  Overnight stays with friends and family where in the country will be allowed for the first time and pubs and restaurants will be able to serve people indoors. Up to  people can attend weddings and other le events such as christenings. May  is the earliest possible date for foreign holidays but it depends on the outcome of a review which reports by April .

Askedsuch a certicate could be required for the pub, Mr Johnson told the Commons Liaison Committee: “I think that that’s the kind of thing – it may be up to inidual publicans, it may be up to the landlord.” Beer gardens and outdoor restaurant spaces are then expected to reopen as part of step two, from April  at the earliest. Indoor pubs and restaurants will not be allowed to reopen until step three, May  at the earliest. The British Pub Confederation hit out at talk of vaccine passports being used to get into boozers. Greg Mulholland said: “We were very happy pubs were doing their bit to help with test and trace. “But for the government to abdicate responsibility and ask pubs to make a moral judgement - it’s just not acceptable. It came as Mr Johnson said putting France on the travel “red list” was “something that we will have to look at”. Any tougher measures would be due to concerns about the spread of the South African and Brazilian strains of coronavirus circulating in France. “We will have to look at tougher measures, just because of this ambiguity about the effectiveness of the vaccines,” he said. Home Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said “everyone understands that hauliers clearly can’t be covered by quarantine and carry on doing their vital job” but she asked “why are you not testing them ” Mr Johnson said: “Tougher measures would have very serious disruption on those trade flows and that has to be balanced against the current ambiguity about the effectiveness of the vaccines on the iants.” The Prime Minister also defended NHS Test and Trace as he said it enabled ministers to understand the pandemic in a “very granular way”. Meg Hillier, chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, asked the Prime Ministerhe had any regrets about how the programme was rolled out for how much it cost.

Professor Adam Finn, who sits on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , insisted that no decision has been made about vaccinating children - despite reports youngsters could start receiving the jab as early as August. The University of Bristol expert said more research was needed before the JCVI could decidethe vaccination programme should be extended to cover children and young people. Under-s are currently not eligible for the Covid jab in most cases but Oxford University is researching the effects of the jab on children, with early results expected in the summer. Children rarely fall ill with the virus but they do play a role in its transmission. While children are unlikely to fall ill with Covid-, they do play a role in transmitting the virus. Officials are said to be looking at how the jab could be extended to children, with the potential to start as early as August, thereported. Asked about the reports, Prof Finn told Good Morning Britain: As far as I know there has been no decision made to immunise children starting in August, or indeed any decision been taken to immunise children at all at this point. But itaposs certainly something that we might need to do. Prof Finn said it was likely that teenagers would be prioritised as the existing evidence shows older children were more likely to spread the virus. He said results from more than one study are needed, adding: If it does turn out to be necessary to immunise children, I think it is more likely that we would prioritise teenagers over younger children, simply because the evidence we have at the moment is that transmission of the virus is more likely to occur from and between teenagers who are a little bit more like adults. I think what we need to learn before thatwhat proportion of the population we need to immunise in order to get effective herd immunity and to suppress circulation of the virus.

Kian Southway died on March  last year just over a week after the first national lockdown began.The talented kickboxer had worries about not being able to sit exams and about a relationship, an inquest at Pontypridd Coronersapos Court heard, Wales Online reports.Four days before he died the Treorchy -year-old had asked his father what time he was going to bed at around .pm. At around .am his younger sister Darcey received a phone call from a concerned friend saying Kian had put up a Snapchat message saying goodbye everyone and she rushed to tell her parents. Kian was found by his parents at their home and the emergency services were alerted. The family did all they could to try and save him before he was taken to hospital in Cardf. The Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhondda pupil was known as a polite and considerate boy. Some of Kianaposs friends provided statements to the coroner and explained he had recently been upset about a relationship he had been involved in with a girl. One friend, who had recently spoken to Kian on Snapchat prior to the incident, said: At first Kian and I were just talking about normal stuff and he askedhe could tell me something. I told Kian he could tell me anything. He chatted about a girl. I didnapost really know what to say to him. Kian didnapost mention anything to me that made me think he would try and harm himself. It was around pm to .pm. That was the last conversation I had with him. The last message I had was a picture message on Snapchat saying aposgoodbye everyoneapos. I didnapost see the message until about am. The girl Kian had been seeing more of leading up to his death also provided a statement to the coroner. She said they werenapost in a relationship but described them as being more than just friends. They had known each other since being in year six but became closer after spending time together at a house party prior to lockdown. The hearing was told Kian became upset when the pair started to talk less.  Her statement read: I last saw Kian the weekend prior to his death. We had a bit of a tf but I wouldnapost say it was a fight or an argument. I wouldnapost always reply straightaway to Kianaposs messages but I didnapost reply to anyone aposs either. I found out what had happened on March . I was forwarded a Snapchat story. The inquest was told Kian spoke to another friend on March  where he expressed being a bit down but said he would be in a happier place tomorrow. It was thought at the time he just meant tomorrow would be a better day as everything was normal. The inquest was told while at hospital Kian spent time in the care of Dr Michelle Jardine, a consultant in paediatric intensive care at the University Hospital of Wales. The staff did all they could to help Kian but, as time went on, it became clear a large part of his brain had been affected by the incident. His condition declined within the last  hours of his le and he died on March , . A statement read on behalf of Kianaposs mother, Jolene Southway, explained the family thought the incident may have been a cry for help but they couldnapost get there soon enough to save him.  Ms Southway mentioned in her statement that Kian once listened to a talk about a woman who contemplated suicide in the Brecon Beacons but someone saved her. When the family once went to Pen y Fan Kian wanted Ms Southway to take him to this area. In the statement she said: Kian wanted me to take him to where the lady spoke about. It was strange how Kian had wanted to visit the area where the woman had wanted to end her le. A statement read on behalf of Ms Southway read: Kian was bright, he was popular, and he was a joy to teach. He loved school and he loved being out with the boys. He always had A*s and As but when he got results he did get some Bs. We probably did give him a little bit of a hard time. The inquest was told he missed school during lockdown and worried about not being able to sit exams and having to rely on predicted grades. Ms Southwayaposs statement also explained the family wasnapost aware Kian had been involved with a girl until more recently. She said when they asked him where he was going before the pandemic Kian simply replied: Out. The statement added: Which was odd because he always told us where he was going. He text us saying he was at a girlaposs house. Ms Southway said he had also become more body conscious. The family reminded Kian that the girl he had been messaging was also experiencing lockdown and may need some time. Kian was said to respond: This is the reason I didnapost want a girlfriend. The statement read on behalf of Ms Southway continued: When he broke up with his first girlfriend he was crying in his room and she said: aposDonapost be silly – there are plenty more fish in the seaapos. The hearing was told Kian registered as an organ donor because he had said in the past: If anything happens to me there is no point in my organs going with me. Two adult lives have since been saved as a result of Kian being a donor. The medical cause of death was provided as a global hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and hanging.

He joked that filling out the initial questionnaire to use it was a “bit awkward” because it didnapost have an option in its multiple-choice list for a job as sixth-in-line to the throne.“I realise I’m an outlier so there’s no need to get the engineers on it!” he told the Wall Street Journal.He added: “I was matched with my coach who, quite frankly, is truly awesome and has always given me sound advice and a fresh perspective, which is so valuable.  In his new role, Harry will help promote mental fitness and expand BetterUpaposs roster of coaches and customers, among other duties, a company blog post said.I firmly believe that focusing on and prioritising our mental fitness unlocks potential and opportunity that we never knew we had inside of us, Harry said in a blog post on the companyaposs website. Referencing his own Army background, Harry added: As the Royal Marine Commandos say, ‘It’s a state of mind.’ We all have it in us. BetterUp previously valued itself at £.billion and has raised £million from venture capitalists. BetterUp CEO Alexi Robichaux declined to reveal what Harryaposs salary would be - saying only that he would be joining the company’s leadership team as an “officer of the corporation. But once coronavirus restrictions ease, Harry is likely to occasionally drop by the companyaposs headquarters and attend some meetings and events too, Mr Robichaux confirmed. Harry and Meghan, who now live in LA with baby son Archie and have another child on the way, have previously signed commercial deals with Netflix and Spoty.Harry also is working with Oprah on a documentary series about mental health for the Apple TV+ streaming service. Mr Plamondon, a startup founder who invests in and grows small apps at Contarini Ventures, estimated the BetterUp deal could be worth an estimated £k to £-m for Harry due to his star power, with a signicant amount of the compensation in equity to begin with. He said Harry could be getting up to £.m in cash compensation per year, explaining: Iaposd expect Prince Harry to have negotiated at least % of customer value for people he brings in over the first few months. With just  customers, thataposd be worth at least £.m, and potentially as much as an additional £-m. CIO roles tended to be aligned to marketing. But a big celebrityaposs team would typically negotiate bonus deals to reward themtheir affiliation drives new sign-ups for the brand, he told the Mirror. That could see Harry bringing in huge signing bonuses in coming yearshis endorsement brings in new clients and as the company grows, Mr Plamondon said. Harry is unique - he actually brings revenue by bringing in prospects. Heaposs more like an in-house influencer, and less like a normal aposImpactapos officer.In his role as a CIO, Harry would likely be brought in to attend meetings to net big new clients and be used in marketing - like writing blog posts or appearing in videos, Mr Plamondon added "},{"url":null,"title":"double chocolate cadbury creme eggs","story":"NewsDouble chocolate Cadbury Creme Eggs exist and people are going wild for themOnline shoppers have discovered that you can now buy an extra-chocolatey Cadbury Creme Egg which has a creamy chocolate filling in the centre and they look deliciousmirrorShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  MAR NewsWe need to try these!\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.Spread the cheer!When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The , tonnes, -metre long vessel appears to have been blown off course by high winds and a dust storm. Before entering the canal, the ship appeared to plot a rather unfortunate course, causing some amusement online. A researcher shared the discovery on Twitter, where they described it as innocent, but terrible luck. John Scott-Railton tweeted: OH NO: misfortuneaposs unerring aim touched #EVERGIVENaposs track as it departed the designated anchorage and steamed into the Canal. . One person joked: Guys, the captain of this Suez ship is a performance artist troll. Another asked: Not just me seeing the giant c*** aposn balls us it  A third added: I can believe that was unintentional... but still darkly hilarious. An official from vesselfinder told Vice News that their tracking data was accurate, writing: There is no room for some kind of conspiracies or  data.The vessel arrived in the Suez Canal on Monday night and eight tugboats are currently trying to dislodge it.Julianne Cona, who is on the vessel behind, wrote on Instagram that the ship was stuck sideways yesterday."},{"url":null,"title":"suez canal could blocked days","story":"NewsSuez Canal could be blocked for days with  ships now stuck on either sideThe -metre, ,-tonne Ever Given ship that is currently blocking the Suez Canal will first have to be towed to another position, marine agent GAC said, before traffic can resumemirrorShareCommentsByYusri MohamedJessica JaganathanFlorence TanClaire Gilbody-Dickerson:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video container-ship-turns-sideways-egypts-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Roughly  ships are stuck on either side of the canal as of Wednesday afternoon . Egypt officials fear it could take days to remove.The Ever Given was stranded on Tuesday morning when it lost its ability to steer after reportedly being hit by strong wind and a dust storm, the Suez Canal Authoritysaid in a statement. About  per cent of global container ship traffic passes through the canal each day, carrying everything from fuel to consumer goods. The main alternative route for ships travelling between Asia and Europe, around the African cape, takes a week longer to navigate.  Pictures posted on social media had appeared to show the ship positioned diagonally across the canal, blocking its fullwidth.Photos shared by the SCA showed a digger removing earth and rock from the bank of the canal around the shipaposs bow. GAC, a Dubai-based marine services company, said the Ever Given had been partially refloated and moved alongside the canal bank, citing information from the SCA. Convoys and traffic are expected to resume as soon as the vessel is towed to another position, GAC said on its website. There was no immediate confirmation from the SCA, but its chairman told local TV that a southbound convoy was on the move and that the authority was trying to keep traffic flowing between waiting areas as best it could. The authority was considering compensation for delayed ships, Chairman Osama Rabie said. Tracking maps had shown the ship grounded in the southernmost stretch of the waterway, between the Great Bitter Lake and the Red Sea port of Suez. At least  ships were blocked to the north of the Ever Given, and three to the south, local sources said.  Several dozen ships could also be seen grouped around the northern and southern entrances to the canal. Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement , the shipaposs technical manager, an investigation has launched after the vessel ran aground at around :am on Tuesday. BSM, which handles the shipaposs crew and technical issues, said all the crew were safe and accounted for and that there had been no reports of injuries or pollution. It said it had notied the authorities and interested parties, but that it could not confirm the shipaposs owner.

They had a lot of corners but that showed our willingness to stop balls into the box at source and then defend the box.“I thought Adam and the two centre-backs in particular defended the box great. It’s not easy when those balls are coming in, we saw that in the game at Alloa earlier in the season.“I was really pleased with that and, with five minutes to go, you don’t want to take the polish off by conceding a sloppy goal.“You could see they were desperate to keep the clean sheet and how much it meant to the players as well.”Having played for the likes of Derby, Crewe, Burton Albion and then a squad goalkeeper at Premier League Burnley, Legzdins has plenty of experience since coming through the Birmingham City academy in .After leaving Turf Moor, he arrived at Dundee in October with the No  spot up for grabs at Dens Park as McPake chopped and changed between Hamilton and young goalie Calum Ferrie.After making his debut in a poor - defeat at Ayr, though there was little blame for the goalkeeper that day, injury struck.A troublesome calf problem on the eve of a League Cup match at Hibs saw Legzdins out of action for almost two months.He ed to fitness but had to remain patient in waiting for his chance against Arbroath last weekend and has made a real impact since.With no crowds at matches this season, it doesn’t take long to notice the effect Legzdins has on more than just his penalty area.Even watching on online streams, fans will be able to make out the goalkeeper yelling instructions to team-mates.McPake says it’s good to see the -year-old use his experience to help the team through dficult moments – evenit has led to one or two very loud disagreements for everyone to hear.“He is vocal and commanding – and demanding of his team-mates as well,” the Dens boss added.“I think we had the two loudest voices in Scottish football yelling at each other on Friday – him and Lee Ashcroft.When there’s no fans there, it’s tough to tell them to shut up and get on with it.“Adam has played at a high level, don’t forget. He has done really well since coming in.“The penalty save against Arbroath was huge, I don’t think he could’ve done much against Ayr and then he got another clean sheet on Friday.“His presence in the goals has been really important.”Fin Robertson: Highly-rated Dundee youngster ruled out for rest of the season\" title\"#Fin Robertson: Highly-rated Dundee youngster ruled out for rest of the season# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp highly-rated-dundee-youngster-fin-robertson-ruled-out-for-the-rest-of-the-season embed # secretMRbrSJZJ\" data-secret\"MRbrSJZJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58562297-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58562297-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58562297-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58562297-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee uniteds jeando fuchs gave perfect reponse to cameroon disappointment","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remDundee United midfielder Jeando Fuchs gave the perfect response to being left out of the Cameroon squad, according to his club boss.Fuchs was named in the provisional group for the African Nations qualiers against Cape Verde and Rwanda, to be played this Friday and next Tuesday respectively.However, he failed to make the final selection so can’t add to his two-cap total.Any disappointment Fuchs suffered, though, didn’t show as he put on a man-of-the-match show as United beat Aberdeen - on Saturday.Tangerines# gaffer Micky Mellon certainly thinks his player will go on to play many more times for his country and is just delighted to have him at Tannadice.The United boss said: “We haven’t been in contact with them but I know they are well aware of how he is doing here.“You all know Jeando is a special footballer – a real talent.“He trains like he plays and that is a lesson for any young player.#Mellon added: “Every day he has big smile on his face and loves his football.“He is a football fanatic and watches three or four games a night.“He loves the game and chats about it all the time.“Having someone like Jeando at the club is great for the environment here because the others look at him and asking themselves why he plays so well.

start of our first national lockdown, when we were told that we would need to stay in our homes and only leave for essential reasons.It’s been a hugely dficult year for many of us, and, through our Childline service, we know the pandemic has had a profound impact on children.Throughout the last year, our Childline counsellors have delivered around , sessions a month with children across the UK, with mental and emotional health being one of the top concerns children and young people speak to us about.For many children, the uncertainty and worry caused by the pandemic has taken its toll on their mental wellbeing, while others have felt trapped in unsafe homes – out of sight and cut off from their usual support networks.When the announcement came last March, at Childline we acted swtly and made our counselling rooms and offices safe spaces for our staff and volunteers, who have been essential workers throughout.We began taking more contacts from children online, which meant some of our staff could work from home. We also made some important changes to the Childline website to provide additional support for children and young people.Unfortunately, our volunteer numbers dropped greatly, due to volunteers needing to self-isolate to stay safe, and we are currently recruiting more volunteers and are delivering training online.Over the past year, our Childline service has been supported by players of People’s Postcode Lottery which has provided crucial funding of £,,, the equivalent of running the service for an entire month.Our fundraising volunteers have also greatly adapted, and have found ways to continue to support NSPCC Scotland through virtual quiz nights, sponsored walks and home cycling challenges on exercise bikes.Now, as more childrento school, we know the impact of the pandemic isn’t over and we need to be ready to support them.It is vital that the Scottish Government delivers an ambitious plan for children that goes beyond catching up on lessons and helps them recover from a really awful year.Schools need continuing support so they are equipped to recognise and respond sensitively and consistently to students who may have experienced adverse experiences and maltreatment during the pandemic.And investment is needed for therapeutic and support services to help children recover from trauma, as well as for pre-school children and their families to prevent the pandemic causing inequalities in child development and educational outcomes.And as we look forward to the summer, let’s also build on the positives, such as the resilience our children and young people have shown, their support for each other, and the many new experiences and opportunities that have come out of the last  months.Childline is here for children, free and confidentially, on   or at www.childline.org.uk and any adult worried about a child can contact    or email help@nspcc.org.uk.

store in Aberdeen#s city centre since it opened its doors in .With its distinctive, stepped concrete exterior, the branch on George Street has been a popular shopping destination for more than three decades.The Co-operative Society#s Norco building was built in  as a #Modernist showpiece# after the original Victorian Co-op was demolished.When John Lewis acquired the property in the late s, it was described as a #golden opportunity# and became the brand#s northernmost branch as part of a multi-million-pound redevelopment.The rippling exterior of the building remained, but a , sq ft extension and addition of a bridge joining onto the Bon Accord Centre, gave John Lewis a floorspace of around , sq ft.The new department store also brought  full and part-time jobs to the city.At the time, the retailer said #opening a store in Aberdeen was a symbolic gesture#.Adding: #It might have been  miles from London, but it was proof that nothing was off limits.#With a well-known reputation for quality and luxury, keen customers queued up excitedly ahead of the official opening on October  .The retailer#s in-house magazine, the Gazette, said #the glistening aisles were soon swarming with intrigued customers# enjoying a new, high-end shopping experience in Aberdeen.The first customer to pass through the doors was Margaret McGregor, right, who lived round the corner on St Andrew Street and felt she deserved to be first in the queue after putting up with months of building work.With its slogan #never knowingly undersold#, customers were promised quality, value and competitive prices over several floors at John Lewis# George Street branch.A flagship in the north of Scotland, people would travel from places like Inverness to spend a day enjoying some retail therapy at the department store.A long-standing name on the British high street, John Lewis opened its first store # a small drapery # on London#s Oxford Street in .The brand absorbed Peter Jones in  before establishing its pioneering #partner scheme# in the s # a revolution for retail.The experimental move saw stakeholder staff getting a say in how the business was run, as well as receiving a slice of the success in stocks.Described as #ahead of its time# in the s, John Lewis remains the largest employee-owned business in the UK today.The company even set up its own free medical service for employees in , before the NHS was founded  years later.In , a change was made so the partners# bonus was received in cash instead of cash and stocks like previous decades.A look back in our archives shows how customers have been spoilt for choice for  years when it comes to clothing, homewares, cosmetics # and first-class customer service.The Aberdeen store has seen many changes over the years and welcomed new brands, as well as undergoing redesigns.In  it expanded its homeware offerings with a new kitchen department, which did a roaring trade in the weeks before Christmas that year.And keeping up with the times, John Lewis stepped into the world of e-commerce, launching its website in .With an extensive collection of menswear and womenswear, the shop would often host fashion shows and charity events in aid of local causes.While the haberdashery occupied a large corner of the ground floor, with racks of colourful fabrics and balls of wool a welcoming sight as shoppers stepped in from the grey street.And for those who shopped until they dropped, there was always a welcome cup of tea and a fine piece available at the shop#s cafes.Head of the branch Robert Garnish and co-founder of Benugo Ben Warner, toasted the opening of the new Benugo coffee shop instore in .For many people it didn#t feel like Christmas until John Lewis had launched its festive displays.In , the Evening Express# own Scott Begbie dressed up as Santa and helped out as a partner during the Christmas rush.While in more recent years, the retailer#s Christmas shop has been a must-visit in December, with its beautully decorated trees, boxes of baubles and shelves of tempting toys bringing seasonal joy.Being in the heart of the city, the local community was important to the staff at John Lewis.The children of Middlefield Community Group said a big thank you to the store#s toy department for the donation of fun Christmas presents in .And in , staff pulled on their lycra for a seven-hour Zumba dance in the Bon Accord Centre to raise money for the Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention Appeal.In , the athletic action continued when a dedicated London  merchandise unit was unveiled to back Team GB as Britain hosted the Olympics.Youngsters from Kittybrewster Primary helped then managing director Rob Holder cut the ribbon on the Olympic shop, which was one of only  launched outside London.Pupils from Kittybrewster Primary School were back in , this time members of the choir helped John Lewis Aberdeen celebrate its th anniversary.Sadly just a few months later, the store was forced to close when non-essential retail was shut down in March  to help prevent the spread of Covid-.However, many of the kind-hearted employees on furlough took on roles volunteering with the NHS.There were smiles all round, not least from branch manager Jamie Wishart, when the shop reopened last summer with new social distancing precautions in place.But like the rest of non-essential retail it was forced to close again in January and it is now proposed that it remains shut permanently.The news comes after the recent announcement that Aberdeen#s Debenhams would never reopen its Trinity Centre premises.It will now join a long list of popular retailers assigned to the history books of Aberdeen, such as the much-loved homegrown brand Esslemont and Macintosh.For as little as £. a month you can access all

Stephen Glass has #earned his spurs#.The Dons have appointed Atlanta United  boss Glass, , as Derek McInnes# replacement.It is Glass# maiden permanent first-team management role.Reds chief Cormack said Glass was chosen from a pile of applicants, some #experienced managers# and others #emerging talent#.The Atlanta-based businessman revealed the Dons board, taking inspiration from the success of Steven Gerrard at Rangers, as well as Pep Guardiola and Zinedine Zidane, thought the latter category better suited their #strategy and philosophy#.Cormack said: #With Stephen, one of the things about being in the States isout of sight, out of mind.#When you think about Scotland and England, we seem to have an aversion to emerging talent and instead we go with the merry-go-round of experienced managers.#For us, as a board with our strategy and philosophy, we felt emerging talent was important.#The most recent example of emerging talent is Steven Gerrard from the under-s at Liverpool.#Look at their season and how they#re playing. Another example is Pep Guardiola, he was coaching younger teams before he got the Barcelona role # he earned his spurs.#Similarly with Zinedine Zidane.#All over Europe, South America and the Americas, emerging talent is absolutely the way forward.#You#ve got Jessy Marsch at Leipzig. He was an assistant coach at a university in the States just a few years ago and now he#s seen as one of the pre-eminent managers at the top level in Europe.#With that being said, when we look at that emerging talent, the people we interviewed, Stephen by far ticked all the boxes.#Glass # who started his playing career at Aberdeen, played in midfield for the Dons between  and  # has all of the qualities to lead the Pittodrie side to success, according to Cormack.The chairman added: #He knows the Aberdeen Way. He was mentored and taught by Teddy Scott, Alex Smith and Willie Miller.#If you put that together with the experience that Stephen has gained, we felt that was the key rationale behind appointing him.#When people say #he#s coaching Atlanta United # # Atlanta United  play in the league below the MLS. There#s no promotion or relegation. In effect it#s like playing in the Scottish Championship.#My view,Bobby Clark#s view and others is that most of the teams in the Championship would struggle in that league.#It#s a very competitive league.#In that league, where it#s full-time, there a number of teams like Atlanta United  that effectively play under- teams.#The goal of that team isn#t necessarily results, it#s bringing through talent.#So, when Stephen moved on to coach the Atlanta United first team last season when they parted company with Frank de Boer, he brought through guys like George Bello, who came through the academy, to USL, to MLS and played almost every game when Stephen was interim coach and he#s now a US international.#He also coached top talent likePity Martinez, who not long after Stephen took over on an interim basis was sold for £ million to a Middle Eastern team.#When you look at these things in context and look at where Stephen has come through # he#s been a fully qualied pro licence coach since  # Stephen has earned his spurs.#Most people I imagine are thinking: #he#s coming from the States, what#s that background # He has absolutely got the coaching experience and leadership skills to take on the Aberdeen job and be successful.#Cormack rubbished any claims Glass got the job because they knew each other, saying this was #absolutely not# the case, but he knew Glass# personality and he was #humble, absolutely clear in what he wants to achieve and the style of football he wants to play#.#We want to be successful, the last thing I want to do is appoint someone who can#t take us forward,# he added.Cormack went on say Glass would #absolutely# be #supported financially# heading into a summer where several Dons players are going to be out of contract or at the end of their loan spells, and after a season which has fallen apart # with just one goal in  matches.mdash EveningExpress SportMarch , He said:  “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to work out that transitioning into the attacking side and scoring goals is a major problem for us.“He’s well aware of the team and the players, the ones who are out of contract in the summer.“You will see some announcements in the next few weeks of players who will come to Aberdeen and add real value to our squad.Cormack added: “The fact we have a number of players out of contract, which we didn’t have last year, yet we still brought players in.“Stephen will be supported this summer and he will be able to recruit the players he feels are necessary to bring in.“At the same time, he wants to take a look at the good young players we have coming through.”It#s understood Glass will bring Celtic midfielder Scott Brown in as his assistant manager and also hopes to land England striker coach Allan Russell as part of his team, however, Cormack said he wouldn#t #steal his thunder# on any announcements.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"crinan puffer goes virtual for 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It therefore has a special responsibility to do all it can to advance the peace process.So, while calling for an end to violence, it is simultaneously supplying the weapons necessary to prolong the conflict.The shameful neglect of this leadership role and continued licensing of arms to facilitate Saudi-led offensives is unsustainable. It is a stance that leaves the UK increasingly isolated on the global stage, with countries including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands already banning the export of arms to Saudi Arabia.The UK government now faces a choice: to join President Biden and live up to its obligations as UN penholder by ending the UK’s involvement in the Saudi campaign, or to continue to act as both peacekeeper and warmonger, undermining any moral leadership it might claim.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,The SNP has voted to conceal Alex Salmond#s evidence to the parliamentary inquiry.The Scottish Conservatives brought a vote to the Salmond inquiry demanding that Salmond’s evidence, much of which is already in the public domain, be published.This would allow Salmond to give crucial evidence in person about the SNP#s botched handling of this case. All the SNP MSPs on the committee, however, voted against its publication, meaning it will not be released.The Scottish public deserves to know the truth of what happened and why £, of public money had to be paid to Salmond.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,The personal testimony of the men and boys in the final independent report into non-recent sexual abuse in Scottish football # who have shown incredible courage # demonstrates how needed this independent review has been.The abuse young players have suffered in football is inexcusable and heart-breaking. By bravely speaking up, they provided the catalyst for the review and the changes that will come from it are thanks to them.We welcome the ongoing work the Scottish Football Associationhas carried out in light of the report’s recommendations and encourage them to continue their progress.The SFA is showing it is willing to listen and implement changes that ensure no more children suffer the experiences described in the report.We are pleased to see children and young people’s involvement in the process, including the consultation with the Scottish Children’s Parliament. The voices of children and young people are crucial to developing improvements for their own wellbeing and safety and to change a culture where children can be frightened to speak up.Safeguarding in Sport, a partnership between Children st and sportscotland, has developed the Standards for Child Wellbeing and Protection in Sport, which state children have a right to express their views and have their voice taken into account.

Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day.

Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The detailed assessment will also consider construction risk, cost and environmental impact of the options and a Statutory Environmental Assessment will be published in April.#Mitigation works at the Rest and be Thankful will carry on meantime, with a new debris cage, catchpit, debris fencing and flood mitigation planned.Medium term improvements are also being considered to improve the route through Glen Croe, including  the forestry track, old military road and other options on public land.Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity, Michael Matheson MSP said: #Following the disruption caused by landslips at the A Rest and be Thankful, I understand the frustration and disruption that these bring for local communities and road users.#We are progressing substantial short term investment in the existing A including installing a debris cage and new culvert, construction of an additional catchpit, debris fencing and flood mitigation measures at the River Croe crossing.#I can also announce today that I have asked Transport Scotland to progress work to look at a medium term resilient route through Glen Croe including consideration of the forestry track, the old military road and other options on land already owned by Scottish Ministers. Depending on the statutory consents required, this work will seek to develop finalised proposals within  months.#Along with this work on the existing A, we are working in parallel to identy a permanent solution to the road at the Rest and be Thankful. Following the conclusion of the preliminary assessment of the corridor options under consideration the preferred corridor has been identied as the Glen Croe corridor, Option .#Identying the preferred route corridor is a major step forward for this vital work and we are now pushing forward to look at five alternative options within that online corridor and starting the process shortly to appoint design consultants for this work.#As I made clear at the Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee last week, I have asked Transport Scotland to accelerate the preparation and delivery of the scheme where possible given the importance of the route to local communities and road users.#However, we are required to follow the correct statutory process to ensure a fair and transparent assessment of options and impacts on local communities and road users.#From today the new Story Map portal will provide regular updates on the design work as we look at alternative options within the preferred route corridor. We are also encouraging those with an interest to provide feedback on the preferred route corridor and possible route options between now and the end of May.#All of this work underlines the Scottish Government’s commitment to continued work with key stakeholders and local communities to ensure that Argyll and Bute remains open for business.#John Gurr, chairperson of The Rest and be Thankful Campaign chairperson, gave the news a lukewarm reception.#Whilst we welcome today’s announcement and the preferred option of Glen Croe, said Mr Gurr, #we are still no further forward in terms of timescales.#As we move into day  of the Rest and be Thankful being closed or disrupted, we urge Mr Matheson to put deliverable dates against this project.#Our request of a completion date of May  has once again fallen on deaf ears and without any mention of any dates it feels very much like a fluffy pre-election promise.#"},{"url":null,"title":"creative youngsters invited to showcase visual artwork","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

MSPs wanted to know when the Scottish Government was advised it would likely lose the challenge raised by Mr Salmond, but ministers said handing over the advice would breach the ministerial code.On two occasions, MSPs voted for the evidence to be released, with a deal eventually being struck in December to reveal the advice only to MSPs on the committee.Following a vote of no confidence threat in the Deputy First Minister, the Scottish Government released ldquokey legal advice, but the Scottish Tories were not satisfied and continued in their bid to oust John Swinney, which ultimately failed.Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon separately sat for mammoth sessions in front of the committee, taking questions from MSPs over several hours.Didnrsquot Mr Salmond face trial on sexual misconduct charges Yes. The former first minister was cleared of  charges at the High Court in Edinburgh in March last year after being arrested in January .What were the issues with Mr Salmondrsquos evidence to the committee Mr Salmond and the committee have been caught in repeated legal wrangles over evidence published by the inquiry.Last month, the former first minister said he would not appear before the committee after it decided not to publish his submission to a separate investigation into whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code over fears it may identy some of the complainers in Mr Salmondrsquos criminal trial last year.However, an alteration made to a court order by Judge Lady Dorrian meant the evidence could potentially be made public.While the committee voted against publication, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Bodymade the decision to publish anyway.The evidence was online for less than  hours before the Crown Office raised concerns with Holyrood about it, asking for redactions to be made.In his submission, the former first minister accused some in the Scottish Government and SNP of a ldquomalicious and concerted attempt to damage my reputation and remove me from public le in Scotland.But Ms Sturgeon said her predecessor did not have ldquoa shred of evidence to support his claims.The submission was later re-released, with a number of paragraphs relating to the set-up of a meeting between Mr Salmond and his successor redacted.Is the committee inquiry the only investigation into the matter No. Ms Sturgeon is currently under investigation by James Hamilton QC to establishshe breached the ministerial code.Ms Sturgeon referred herself after being accused of misleading Parliament over when she knew of the complaints against Mr Salmond.She previously said she had been told about the allegations by Mr Salmond himself during a meeting in her home on April , .However, it was later found that Mr Salmondrsquos former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein had met with the First Minister in her Holyrood office four days prior to that, where she was told of the complaints.Scotlandrsquos first minister @NicolaSturgeonresponds to @SkyNewsexclusive the harassment committee has ruled she misled Parliament in her evidence.ldquoThe opposition members of this committee made their minds up about me before I uttered a single word of evidence. pic UNeUJsmdash Fraser KnightMarch , What has the committee concluded A leak on Thursday evening from inside the committee revealed it has concluded the First Minister misled the inquiry over whether she had offered to intervene in the case ndash which Ms Sturgeon denies doing.Two other witnesses, one of whom is Mr Salmondrsquos lawyer and former SNP MSP Duncan Hamilton and who was at the meeting in question, contradicted the First Ministerrsquos statement.The conclusion was arrived at following a - party line vote, with the four SNP members of the committee, including convener Linda Fabiani, supporting the First Ministerrsquos assertion.What happens next The decision is likely to increase pressure on Ms Sturgeon to stand down before Mayrsquos election, although it is unclear whether the act was deemed a resignation-worthy offence.Last night, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross called for her to quit.He said: ldquoThe committee will publish its findings in the coming days and we will wait for that report.ldquoBut we have already detailed that Nicola Sturgeon lied to the Scottish Parliament and for that, she must resign. All wersquore waiting for is confirmation.Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: ldquoI am not going to prejudge the outcome of the committee report and we await its findings, butit does conclude that the First Minister has misled Parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code then that is incredibly serious.A Scottish Parliament spokesperson said: \"Further to media reports on the Committeersquos findings, the Committee is still finalising its report.

In this instalment, we spoke to Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross.Q. What is your party planning to do for the Borders, in particular A. We are very keen to see voices across Scotland heard, because I think after the last  years of the SNP being in charge we have seen decisions taken that suit the central belt of Scotland, but not the south of Scotland.Areas such as Peeblesshire have largely been ignored. I said when I became leader of the Scottish Conservatives, probably because I represent an area outwith the central belt, I want to make sure that the voices of communities that havenrsquot been heard are finally heard in the Scottish Parliament.With a local candidate like Shona Haslam, we have got an excellent local advocate who is passionate about the local community, who will drive for more local services to be delivered locally and more investment for local communities.I have done a lot about ensuring carer funding for local authorities, recruiting new teachers right across the country, investing in businesses to protect peoplersquos jobs and I think as we come out of this pandemic, itrsquos really important that the focus of the Scottish Parliament and every MSP is on recovery and rebuilding after the most dficult  months we have had ndash rather than the SNPrsquos plans for another referendum.Q. We have run stories about local businesses being hurt by the impact of Brexit. What assurances can you give them A. I donrsquot underestimate the challenge that businesses have faced and those who have raised concerns directly with me, I have treated them really seriously and wersquove got to resolve them.I welcome the fact that there was a compensation scheme, particularly for fishing.The pound million was important, but I said at the time that wonrsquot be enoughwe still have the underlying problems with added bureaucracy and delays in getting produce out to Europe.From the conversations I have had, there have been improvements, but there are still challenges that we have got to navigate.Thatrsquos why Lord Frost has been appointed to look at these issues in detail and get them resolved so we can have a far smoother process.That means reducing the number andof forms, the bureaucracy that there is and allowing businesses to do what they do best which is getting our great produce out and into the European Union market.Q. Scottish Borders Council has declared a climate emergency. What are the Scottish Conservatives doing in terms of the climate A. I think the climate  the environment  the green agenda will go through all partiesrsquo manestos over the next few weeks, because the UK is hosting the COP conference in Glasgow.Itrsquos a real opportunity for us to showcase to the whole world the s Scotland has gone to with renewable energy and the progress wersquove made in terms of development of new, renewable technologies and the investment we can make.

Why do you think your party, traditionally, hasnrsquot been as successful in Scotland as it has in England A. If you just look at the last few election campaigns, we have made signicant gains. In the  election we more than doubled the number of our MSPs and it was because the Scottish Conservatives more than doubled in size that we prevented the SNP from getting a majority and prevented them holding another independence referendum.Itrsquos absolutely clearwersquore to stop the SNP again, only by using votes for the Scottish Conservatives can people be assured of that outcome.We have made progress at every election in recent years, both at Holyrood, Westminster and local authorities and we are clearly the strongest challengers to the SNP right across the country.I donrsquot put a limit on my ambitions for the party. Wersquove got great local candidates like Shona [Haslam] and great representatives like David Mundell. People can see that the Conservatives deliver for the communities they represent.Readersrsquo questions Q. If everyone apart from you voted for the SNP, would you still refuse to back another independence referendum A. I am a Scottish Conservative and Unionist, so I will never support another independence referendum. I think the ision that caused in our country in  is still in our society right now. Itrsquos damaging.But we are still dealing with a global pandemic and we will be dealing with the effects of COVID- on our economy for years to come.It is the height of irresponsibility for the SNP to say they are going to push ahead with another independence referendum, rather than focus on our recovery rebuilding as a country and mending the ision that has distracted Scotland for so long.Q. What is your opinion of the allegations of lsquochumocracyrsquo over the awarding of PPE contracts by the UK Conservative government A. These things are all investigated by the Public Accounts Committee in the UK Parliament, which is chaired by a member of the opposition who will look into these details.The Cabinet Office will also look into it. I think overall wersquove got to look at how the country responded to COVID- and in terms of getting PPE into the country at a vital time and ensuring our NHS is not overwhelmed when we saw other countries in Europe such as Spain and Italy seeing their NHS overwhelmed.Wersquove seen an outstanding roll-out of the vaccination programme. Thatrsquos only been possible here in Scotland because the UK Government procured and developed vaccines at an early stage in the pandemic.And wersquove seen the support in terms of the furlough scheme to protect almost one million jobs in Scotland, the support for self-employed, and the support for businesses.All that has been possible because of the strength of the United Kingdom. Thatrsquos the area that most people focus on in terms of the COVID pandemic with me ndash just how we have all worked together during the most dficult  months where the sacrices people have made wouldrsquove been unimaginable a year ago.I think we can see light at the end of the tunnel and one day this will all be a very bad and distant memory.Q. As a Westminster MP, why are you calling for a vote of no confidence in the leader of another parliament [Nicola Sturgeon], when the UKrsquos [Conservative] home secretary has broken the ministerial code and the health secretary has acted unlawfully *Please note: Our interview with Mr Ross took place on Friday, March . Since then, a vote of no confidence in Ms Sturgeon has been held ndash it failed by - . The First Minister has also been cleared by an independent investigation, conducted by James Hamilton QC, following allegations she broke the Scottish Ministerial Code. Welcoming the reportrsquos findings, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoMr Hamilton has considered all of the allegations against me, and I am happy that his reportrsquos findings clear me of any breach of the ministerial code.A. Because I am the leader of the main opposition party in Scotland and itrsquos the role of the leader of the opposition party to scrutinise the conduct of the Scottish Government, ministers and First Minister.We have seen in the evidence to the parliamentary enquiry that Nicola Sturgeon has breached the ministerial code, she has misled parliament and there is no way anyone can continue as First Minister having misled parliament.Itrsquos my role as leader of the main opposition party to highlight that and I believe there is a strong case that Nicola Sturgeon should resign."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-peeblesshire-test-sites-operate-next-week","story":"THREE places in Peeblesshire will be among the next Borders sites offering tests to people without coronavirus symptoms.On March , NHS Borders announced that new community testing centres would be rolled out across the region.And on Tuesday , the health board revealed that fire stations in Peebles, Innerleithenand West Lintonwill be offering tests next week.:Heroin offences: Peebles man sentenced after admitting pair of drugs crimesNHS Bordersrsquo director of public health, Dr Tim Patterson, said: ldquoThe more we know about COVID-and where it currently is the better able we will be to contain it and limit its spread throughout our communities.ldquoAlthough cases in the Borders are low at present, there are still cases out there.

Ed called a meeting at his home on March   to discuss the matter, with  settlers in attendance.A petition was drawn up and signed, asking for the creation of a post office with Ed as postmaster. He suggested naming the settlement Edison in honour of the inventor Thomas Edison.This led to the establishment in  of a trading post on land donated by Ed. In around , Edison#s first hotel was built on a small section of Ed#s land adjoining that on which the store stood.In , Ed married Mary Judson whose parents, Phoebe and Holden Judson, founded the city of Lynden in Washington. Ed and Mary had two children, a son and a daughter.Their son, also named Edward, farmed the family#s land from  until  before moving to San Francisco in , and later to Seattle.While Jim and his relatives know a fair bit about those who moved over the pond, they are keen to find out more about their ancestors who lived in Kintyre prior to those who emigrated.Anyone who is able to assist with their research, can contact Jim by emailing mfcnevada@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is in contradiction to what is surely the council#s main aim when setting the budget # saving money where possible.Despite many of KRL#s staff having barriers to working, they do an exemplary job and are happy in their workplace # something which is evident from a visit to the recycling centre. The fact that some of them may lose the jobs they enjoy and do so well as a result of this decision is shocking and heart-breaking.Campbeltown has seen record levels of redundancies over the last couple of years, with more than  lay-offs at CS Wind and Campbeltown Creamery alone, never mind the many people who have since lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. To potentially add to this level of unemployment for no apparent good reason is baffling.KRL not only provides an efficient and cost effective service but worthwhile jobs to people who may otherwise struggle to find employment and are no doubt very concerned about their futures right now.This decision should be reconsidered."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I immediately hung up # wondering which of my frailties had been discovered # and phoned  which tells you the last number that called.I twice noted the number given by  and ventured to phone it. On dialling this number, the phone company advised me that there was #no such number#.Over a week, adopting identical procedures, five dferent #no such numbers# were found. The job of answering morning calls was then delegated to the message answering machine and only once did it receive a call which was terminated speedily by the caller without a message.Is there a flaw in our phone companies# systems with consequent loss of income  If this flaw could be eradicated, phone scammers might be less numerous and consequently afford a little more protection for the vulnerable.Going by theof John Newall#s reply to my letter on England#s disastrous Brexit, forced upon Scotland against our democratic wishes, I had expected better than the mishmash of worn out tropes and John Bull exceptionalism trotted out by Mr Newall.Mr Newall makes great play of the successful roll-out of the Covid vaccine in Scotland and the UK. He is absolutely right, it has been a fantastic achievement, but to then go on to use this success to denigrate the EU#s vaccine programme is crass and over simplistic.Our success is an illusion until both doses of vaccine are administered, crowing about vaccines when only . per cent of the UK population has had the vital second jag, compared, for example, to . per cent in Denmark, is both presumptuous and inappropriate.Mr Newall goes on to assert that Scotland has a deficit that will prevent Scotland re-entering the EU, without of course mentioning the elephant in the room, the UK#s ruinous £ trillion # and increasing # debt. Unionists need to get their own house in order before lecturing anyone .Of course, legally, Scotland has no #deficit# or #debt#. How can a country with virtually no borrowing ability have a debt  What Scotland does have is a notional #debt#, the price of Westminster failure within the UK, where spending outwith Scotland#s control is assigned to Scotland, such as Trident, HS and London’s Crossrail. Spending that Scots taxpayers cough up for.Indeed,Courier readers start counting now at the rate of one a second, they#ll reach the number of pounds spent on Boris Johnson’s failed Track and Trace system at about .am on April  in the year . Readers may well wonder where the money went and why this is being loaded on to Scotland#s ledger.Straight from the #Better Together# playbook, Mr Newall brings up the hoary old #Spanish veto# myth. The truth is that Spain has no issue with an independent Scotland in the EU so long as this is within the framework of the UK constitution # which it is.Unlike Catalonia#s predicament, Scotland is not a #region# of the UK, there is no constitutional prohibition on independence votes or indeed of Scotland abrogating the  Treaty of Union with England.This is why successive prime ministers, from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron, have repeatedly recognised the right of the Scottish people to independence # and why Boris Johnson#s oafish #No# will run into the sand.Mr Newall and I will never agree but that is the essence of democracy, and the right to choose in a free country.Scotland can either remain, semi-detached and impotent, as part of an increasingly insular Little Englander Tory Britain, bringing in its wake further austerity and diminished le chances for our young people, or Scots can vote for independence, just like our neighbours.Yes, there will be dficult choices, yes, there will be mistakes, but they will be our decisions to get right as we work for the prosperous, open and internationalist country that is within our grasp.I am delighted that our council will be investing nearly £. million to help keep Argyll and Bute going and growing.After relentless campaigning from myself and others it#s great to see, at long last, some substantial investment in our crumbling infrastructure.Building on investments made in previous years, an additional £. million will be invested to drive forward improvements and repairs to Argyll and Bute#s network of roads in rural, remote, island and urban communities, bringing the overall roads reconstruction budget to £ million for  .We are also investing more in active travel, in line with the council#s agreed priorities. This includes a further £, in enhancing and improving footpaths. This investment complements the current allocation of £, in green transport and travel.This recent Covid pandemic has highlighted more than ever the need to tackle our urban-rural ide.

I’m not alone in this: stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and around . million survivors are living with its devastating effects.Despite this, research into stroke is severely underfunded. Just one per cent of the total UK public and third sector health research spend goes towards stroke research.The Stroke Association has launched a unique opportunity for stroke survivors and those who care for stroke survivors to have our say on the future of stroke research. Partnered with the James Lind Alliance, the charity will find out what matters to us most so research can make the biggest dference to our lives.With such limited funds for stroke research, worsened by the Covid- pandemic, it#s vital that we come together and make our voices heard.If you#re a stroke survivor, or you care for or work with someone affected by stroke, join me and speak up for stroke.Visit www.stroke.org.uk jla by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Minutes later, the MFV steamed away from the village, minus the men.A Land Rover had earlier searched a wide area in vain for them.On Tuesday morning, three Marines called at the village bar and asked for sandwiches. An employee said they were obviously very tired and had just come from the hills.Contact was established with the missing men in the early hours of yesterday. They had been in the hills and were discovered by a Land Rover which had been searching for them.The men were yesterday trying to make their way back to the base at Plymouth. It is understood they have not been seen since the weekend.The men had, in fact, being separated for a time but had managed to meet up with each other, too late to catch the boat at a pre-arranged rendezvous.Council brevitiesThe cost of converting council-controlled coin-operated locks to take decimal currency was to be £.

Mr Wilson is trying to muddy the waters there.Whilst Mr Wilson is correct that Scotland cannot have debt , Scotland does have deficit, and the reason we know this is because the SNP-run Scottish Government tells us so in the annual Government Revenue and Expenditure, Scotlandbut Mr Wilson contradicts himself by going on to say that Scotland has a #notional debt# . Scotland has no debt. Scotland cannot have debt. Mr Wilson needs to realise that debt and deficit are two dferent things.With regard to HS, yes, Scotland pays a two per cent share of the total cost but will receive approximately . per cent back in Barnett consequentials. THAT is a very good deal for Scotland. London#s Crossrail  Not a single penny for that will be paid for by Scotland.Mr Wilson goes on to say that there is no #prohibition on independence votes#. Another error from him. Section  of The Scotland Act , the act which allowed us to have a devolved assembly and to which the then Scottish Office signed up, lays down the exact process required. We need permission from HMGov.Oh, and the notion that Scotland can abrogate the Treaty Of Union is also wrong. Whilst Westminster is a parliament of equals, it cannot of itself dissolve the Treaty of Union of which it was not itself a progenitor. That is the prerogative of the suspended national parliaments of England and Scotland, which will require to be recalled from suspension #in abeyance ad interim# where they legitimately reside at the present time. Only the recalled national parliaments of Scotland and England may re-negotiate the  Treaty of Union.I would take this opportunity to remind Mr Wilson of two things: we had a referendum in  and voted to stay in the UK, and he should really learn to live with that and in no election ever, General or Scottish, has the SNP garnered more than  per cent of the vote.The decision by Argyll and Bute Council to stop funding Kintyre Recycling Limited is perverse to say the least.No thought seems to have been given to the level and cost of the future support for the employees who will be thrown on the scrap-heap. Will that go to the social work department and will they get the same level of support as they do now No thought seems to have been given to the effect on the mental health of the employees # what support will be available and what budget will it come from How can the expenditure of a quarter of a million pounds be justied when the council is struggling for money and how long will it take to save this amount compared with the partial funding for Kintyre Recycling Limited It is shameful that only two of our local councillors are against vulnerable people being thrown on the scrap-heap when all three should be supporting their constituents.I am pleased to support the new business group set up to campaign for a quick and permanent solution for the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A.It’s now seven months since the landslide closed the A last summer. That should have been a wake-up call for the SNP Government, but all we#ve had since then is a failed attempt to protect the Old Military Road from landslides and talk of taking  years to solve the problem.This is just not good enough. We need urgent action now.Last week#s Courier letters page didn#t offer much hope. The SNP only wrote about independence, not the real issues facing us, such as the Rest and Be Thankful.The SNP Government should be concentrating on fixing the Rest and Be Thankful and recovering from the Covid pandemic, not spending its time plotting about independence.This Mother#s Day, school feeding charity Mary#s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary#s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world#s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary#s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That#s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary#s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother#s Day.

That is a tough place to be in.The first occasion, He told them to go out again into deeper water , on the second occasion,it was to cast the net on the right side of the boat. In both accounts, these fishermen caught so many fish the nets were at breaking point.Oh, that it could always be as straightforward as that!Right now, fishermen and their families are facing such a dficult time and feeling that their voices are not being heard. These Bible stories remind us that their need and cry is heard by Jesus, the one who chose fishermen as His companions whilst on earth.We too must not forget them and this important industry in our west coast communities. I hope you will join me in praying for them, not only for their daily safety but also for provision and wisdom.In these stories, there is a lesson for us all to think about. What obstacle do you face this week that could be overcome by changing our actions or by thinking dferently  We resist change particularly when something has worked for us in the past, but sometimes we need a dferent approach.Sometimes, like the disciples, we too can find that calling on Jesus gets us through."},{"url":null,"title":"creative youngsters invited to showcase visual artwork","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 19 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Gerard was a highly accomplished poet, whose writings reflected a broad hinterland of experience, exploring human relationships, wildle and politics.#He was always generous with his time and advice too, nurturing and encouraging others to express themselves, write creatively and get into print. Hosting a competition in his name is an ideal way to acknowledge his achievements while promoting new poetry and poets, as Gerard so often did in his letime.#Brought up in Worcestershire, Gerard Rochford,was educated at Hull and Oxford universities but lived most of his le in his adopted home city of Aberdeen, where he was a distinguished professor and psychotherapist.Poetry was his true vocation and he was widely published in newspapers, influential online magazines, chapbooks and poetry collections.At the heart of Aberdeen#s vibrant poetry scene, Gerard was highly respected, not only for the quality of his own work, but for his generosity of spirit and time, mentoring and championing the work of nascent poets.A regular visitor to Canada, Rochford established himself as a transatlantic poet and became an important and active part of the poetry scene in Victoria.Poetry was a letime labour of love but, as father to  children – including Simon – with his we Anne, who was of Indian descent, Gerard#s greatest joy was his family.The closing date for entries to the Gerard Rochford Poetry Prize  is June  and winners will be announced on Sunday September .Full details and entry rules for the competition are available on the Mist and Mountain Creative Residency website at https:mistandmountain the-gerard-rochford-poetry-prize- "},{"url":null,"title":"from our files march 19 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

While he was gutting and cleaning a large cod at sea, something fell onto the deck.When the deck was cleared and washed down, Mr Colville examined his find# the honeycomb from a bee#s hive!How on earth it ever managed to find its way to the murky depths and into a cod#s stomach we will never discover.It is just #one of those things#.Councillors call for removal of #eyesore#Campbeltown councillors are up in arms about a #rusting eyesore# which is lying on the shores of Campbeltown Loch.The ex-Admiralty tug Empire Ace ran aground at Southend nearly two years ago and was towed to the loch, where it was beached. It has lain at the Rocky Burn area ever since.The vessel caused a row between the Town Council and the firm who owned it, George Hood and Company of Helensburgh.At a meeting last September, it was suggested that the firm be charged dues.Councillor Harry Moffat was quoted as saying: #If people are allowed to dump boats in the loch, I can go and dump a car and nobody can do anything about it.#The council discussed the question of taking legal action against the firm. A considerable number of people have since remarked on the unsightliness of the vessel, which has started to rust.Fishermen ing from the grounds were using the Empire Ace as a mooring stage while they cleaned and washed their catches.But a spokesman for the Helensburgh firm said that it had sold the vessel some months ago. The spokesman refused to reveal the identity of the buyers, but after inquiries, we ascertained that it was purchased by McFadyen’s, the local contracting firm.A spokesman for Archibald McFadyen and Sons said that the Empire Ace was purchased by the firm about two weeks ago.He added that breaking up work was to start on the vessel #within the next few days#.Tobacco firm expands furtherThe well-known Campbeltown firm of Richard Daniels Ltd, tobacco wholesalers and distributors, has opened a depot in Peebles, to meet an increased demand from customers on the east coast.The firm, whose custom stretches from Aberdeen to Middlesborough in England, has just been awarded a #very large# contract from a brewing firm to supply its retail outlet # public houses.Askedthe Peebles opening would create redundancies locally, Mr James Daniels told the Courier that staff in Campbeltown would be unaffected.#It is merely a new phase being added to the business,# he said.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCastlehill Church Sunday SchoolThe children of the Kinloch Church Sunday School had a highly enjoyable social evening on Friday last. After the customary tea, brief addresses of a helpful nature were given by Rev N Mackenzie, Mr Drysdale , Mr Dick, Mr M’Dougall, Mrs M’Kerrow and the chairman, Rev CVA MacEachran.Among the singers were Misses M’Naughton, M’Cloy, Black and Burnfield, and among the reciters Misses M’Naughton, Macdonald, and Gilchrist, and John M’Lachlan and Don Gilchrist.The two most juvenile performers were amongst the best # Nancy Noal and Norman Keith.A sketch carrying a good moral was cleverly presented as well as a duet in character by J Black and Babette Burnfield. During the evening, Mrs Keith, Gowanlea, presented about  certicates from the Church of Scotland for perfect attendance throughout the year, and  for regular attendance.The musical programme reflected much credit upon Miss Finlay and Mr Hogg who trained the children and upon Miss Rae who was accompanist."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday march 19 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I care about mankind in general and the plight of its citizens, particularly where there is a prevalence of political ineptitude affecting their lives.To reiterate, the EU purchasing system regarding vaccines was and still is chaotic, with the bureaucratic executive in Brussels initially lashing out, and currently certain members within the group are endeavouring to purchase supplies of vaccines for their citizens.In addition, we now have a ban by some countries of vaccine exports from EU manufacturers to non-EU countries. An action which has angered the World Health Organization and upset Australia and other countries.Regarding the comment that the vaccine success is an illusion, perhaps the perusal of some scientic pronouncements in relation to the efficacy would be appropriate.To accuse me of crowing is not only resented but additionally hurtful. I have an extended family in France.My daughter is married to a now retired French army captain and she is an environmental scientist and director of a laboratory in the IRD , a French public research institution. While her mother-in-law has had her first vaccination and in the last week so has her husband, she does not know when she will get an appointment.Currently, in certain areas of France, the virus is very active and part of her remit involves travel to some of these hot-spots when working from home is not practicable. A situation which is very concerning to me.I also do not know when I will be permitted to see them, either in France or in Scotland.Crowing, indeed, I think not.Amidst the miscellany of economic disaster claims awaiting an independent Scotland thrown up by Michael McGeachy in last week#s Courier, I am gratied that Mr McGeachy does, at the very least, accept that Scotland has no debt at the point of independence. This is progress.Unfortunately, Mr McGeachy then goes on to hold up Scotland#s putative deficit as an ace card in the unionist case to #prove# that Scotland is an economic basket-case surviving on English largesse. In reality, it demonstrates the opposite.Scotland#s #deficit#, created within the UK, with our overall budget set by another government # that#s  per cent of Scotland#s revenues and  per cent of our spending # is a damning indictment of Westminster#s reckless economic vandalism. It is the cost of Westminster Tory rule and the union#s failure.Indeed,being part of the UK was such an advantage, Scotland would have a stronger economy than our northern independent competitors.That they are all considerably more successful, with fewer economic resources than Scotland, makes the case for Scotland to have control of all the sovereign economic levers required to succeed in the global economy.Mr McGeachy concludes with the familiar splenetic, #you had your referendum# in . In this time we have had three Prime Ministers, two Westminster elections and one Holyrood election, not forgetting England#s Brexit imposed upon Scotland.Democracy is not pick and mix, Mr McGeachy. The #Better Together# parties can huff and puff about #taking back control# to London, but Scotland is not their possession.We still live in a free country andScots vote this May for an SNP government focused on Scottish priorities, including the right to ensure that Scotland#s future is Scotland#s choice, not Boris Johnson#s, democracy, as we saw with the election of President Biden, will prevail.The fact that the SNP has produced a new digital strategy document will come as little consolation to residents of the Highlands and Islands, who would struggle to download it eventhey wanted to.The SNP has left the Highlands and Islands in the digital dark ages.The  SNP manesto committed to deliver superfast broadbandto every home and business by . This has comprehensively failed, with ministers refusing to discuss completion dates. A December  report logged an average download speed of .Mbps in Glen Shiel. That is  times slower than Scotland’s fastest street.The pandemic has exposed the glaring digital ide that exists between rural and urban parts of Scotland.Scottish Liberal Democrats want our remote and rural communities to be great places to live, work and study.That#s why we are setting out new proposals to put power in the hands of local community managers and prioritise investment in catch-up zones to ensure that everyone has access to the digital services they need to prosper.Cancer continues to claim lives regardless of the pandemic.As resources within the NHS are stretched to their limits, charities like Target Oian Cancer need your help more than ever before. Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In , my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died.Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today.

It also offers golfers a virtual golf simulator where they will be able to play some of the best courses in the world.In line with the focus on reducing the club#s carbon footprint and the ambition to become more environmentally friendly, the new clubhouse boasts the latest air source heating technology providing the most efficient renewable heating.Aligned to this bright future, the number of junior members at the golf club continues to boom despite the recent lack of clubhouse facilities # there are now  members under the age of , making up  per cent of the total membership.Club captain William Livingston said: #This truly is a momentous moment in the club#s history. The design by G Architects has always stimulated the imagination and it coming to le has been truly inspiring.#The club would like to thank Roy Malcolm and the design team at G Architects for delivering this outstanding building.#The skill and workmanship of Barry Colville and his team in building this magnicent asset has been outstanding, particularly with all of the challenges laid out on a construction site during the global pandemic.#They have worked tirelessly to bring the project to completion in such a short timescale and we want to pass on our sincere gratitude to them for the wonderful job they have done.#I#d like to thank the club#s staff and the committee who, over the last two years, have worked incredibly hard to support the project over and above undertaking their normal club duties.#The club looks forward to welcoming all members, visitors and guests alike to share in this wonderful new facility just as soon as the Scottish Government advises us that it is safe to do so.#Barry Colville, managing director of McKinven and Colville Ltd, said: #Firstly, I#d like to express how incredibly proud I am of both our staff team and our sub-contractors for providing the endless expertise, dedication and commitment they have shown in bringing this magnicent project from design to completion.#This is particularly rewarding for us as a company, especially to do so within the challenging times that we have all had to encounter over the past year.#I#d also like to thank the project#s design team, Roy and the rest of the G staff team, for their spectacular design and support throughout the project.#Finally, I#d like to thank the Machrihanish Golf Club committee for having the faith in awarding this contract to McKinven and Colville Ltd.#We very much look forward to the club opening its doors to all the members in the near future, allowing us all to enjoy this new, st century building, which I believe, will be an envy of many golf clubs throughout the country.#"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 19 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A boss criticises a worker for an unavoidable error. A law officer takes a bribe. A cashier short changes a customer…I could go on.Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard remained a Christian all his le, but was very critical of the church in his day for its double standards.As we approach Easter, I think of how the crowds who welcomed Jesus into Jerusalem, pulling branches off the trees to wave, shouting #Hosanna# so enthusiastically, were largely the same crowds calling for his blood only days later when they called #Crucy#. How could they turn so quickly  Where was their integrity Some just followed the crowd others feared Jesus was challenging the accepted order, so better get rid of him for the greater good.If we face betrayal, injustice, double standards, how do we react  Revenge, get our own back  That is a very natural reaction, but the consequence is to prolong the bitterness, perhaps ramp up the situation.Jesus asks us to step back, to #turn the other cheek# , to suck up the injustice, the double standards, and let peace rule.Impossible  Well, that is what He did at the cross, and because of Him, I think it is possible.I don#t always get it right in my le, but #don#t do as I do , do as He tells you#. In the long run, it is for your own good."},{"url":null,"title":"council dedicated to ensuring young people have a voice","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Large screens and improved wi-fi will be installed, along with new furniture creating a ldquoversatile space for dining, socialising and learning, with options of informal teaching or group working.During the  consultation, pupils wanted to develop the idea of non-designated toilets that were open to all.Three signage options are being considered:The council spokesperson said the cubicles were fully enclosed from floor to ceiling, offering complete privacy.They followed the design in use in the Dunbar Grammar School extension and Wallyford Primary School, as well as many other schools and public buildings across Scotland.Following consultation with the parent and pupil council, four separate cubicles have also been designed with wash hand basins within, offering an additional choice of facilities.The council spokesperson said: ldquoMusselburgh Grammar students are being asked for their views. Signage,chosen, would be erected at the entrance to the toilets as it would be at any other toilet block.The current pupil council is aware that the initial consultation was three years ago and is looking to revisit the designation of toilets to give new pupil cohorts the opportunity to share views.Pupils are being asked to vote in confidence on the available signage options for the new toilets using a Google form.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe refurbishment programme at Musselburgh Grammar will offer a more modern and spacious social and dining area that will also support learning. New toilet facilities will be part of the space.ldquoThe proposals have been developed following extensive consultation with the parent and pupil councils and we continue to work closely with both groups.ldquoAll cubicles within the two toilet blocks are floor to ceiling and private. When the doors are closed, it looks like a wall. There is a universal sink. At the end of each block there are additional toilets which contain private sinks. There are additional toilet options throughout the school.ldquoWe already have examples of similar set-ups within some other school buildings and there are examples of this design in schools across Scotland.

His aunt would have surely pointed it out to him. Then he read the information board and realised it was a recent reconstruction. The name of the nearby cafe now made sense to him.On the path that followed the old railway line, Finn stopped. There it was, hersquod found it: the oak tree. It still looked young, standing guard over the pebbly beach with multiple spreading branches and the magisterial presence Finn remembered.His daughter headed immediately to the waterrsquos edge. It was a much busier place now, with frequent walkers on the nearby path.There was a suspension footbridge spanning the river which Finn couldnrsquot recall. A couple walking by paused for a moment but didnrsquot come to the beach. Perhaps social distancing had some benefits, thought Finn.While his daughter played, he tried to identy the spot he had spent that first night of storytelling with his aunt.ldquoHere, right here, he whispered to himself.Time and space fused together as he imagined going back to the past to explain to his -year-old self what that evening of tales around the fire had really meant.But he would not have been able to listen, not even to his older self. His world then was a broken mirror with vital pieces missing in which he could see only part of himself those pieces lost to him forever. Guilt and anger clawed at Finnrsquos gut, rousing his depression from its slumber.He felt the dark creature trying to pull him down, pain taking over. No, not now, he thought, not in the presence of his daughter.He would not submit to it, refused to feed it with more ruminations.He wonderedhe should have taken Eilidh on this pilgrimage of healing. But yes, her presence with him, and his love for her, was the light in his soul that kept the dark creature at bay.He would be present for her and walk with her to the summit of the faerie hill. She wanted to leave the faeries a gt and a wish. Finn did too.ldquoYou ready for that walk up the faerie hill  he called out to his daughter. She nodded excitedly with a joyful smile.September Finnrsquos phone call to his mum before they left Strathyre suggested he was coping with the temporary separation. He hadnrsquot wanted to climb the faerie hill, but Izzy hoped hersquod be up for a walk up to the rock of the boar when they got to Balquhidder.It was still early morning as they crossed the old Stron Bridge and a stunning view of Loch Voil greeted them.Mist spiralled from the water and swirled around the trees on the steep braes either side. But it was already warm, with more blue sky than grey above the mist. It was set to be one of those glorious September sunny days, the kind you appreciate all the more because you know it may be the last for a long time. They stood awhile watching the mist play above the loch, as the mountains slowly revealed themselves. The Highlands wake slowly in the morning.Izzyrsquos soul tingled as she soaked in the beauty of the moment and breathed in the sweet air.ldquoCan you smell that Finn, the scent of the Highlands  she said.Finn raised his head and snfed: ldquoSmells like cow dung.He was right, it did now. A waft of it came from a nearby field where cattle grazed. Izzy laughed.ldquoAye, well, thatrsquos the historic smell of the Highlands too!She led Finn back to the old bridge they had just driven over. Its three arches spanned the river with historic elegance.They sat on the walls looking down at the water and Izzy took it as an opportunity to tell Finn about the drovers, how in days of old they would come this way, driving hundreds of cows to markets in the south, crossing rivers and traversing through glens.Theyrsquod often sleep outside with the cattle, or sometimes in droversrsquo inns. They were the cowboys of the old Highlands, who knew the land and the dferent hazards of each route, but didnrsquot wear Stetsons of course, and rarely had a horse.She pointed towards the hills to the north: ldquoOver there was a droversrsquo route, bringing the cattle this way. The drovers could veer round and steer the cattle east of the river, but with this bridge theyrsquod have been able to cross here, then again at Strathyre downriver. There were lots of dferent ways, and the drovers had detailed maps inside their heads drawn by experience. Cattle were so valuable they would often be lted by one clan from another.Finn looked bemused.ldquoLted  Like carried on their shoulders  Izzy burst out laughing at the image and Finn looked hurt.ldquoAw, sorry Finn, I wasnrsquot laughing at you, I was laughing at the image you painted in my imagination. Lted means, well, stolen. But people called it lting because it was seen as a tradition rather than a crime. At least by those doing the lting!Finn looked around, still feeling a bit raw by his auntrsquos reaction to his question.ldquoI havenrsquot watched TV for a whole day now, he said, realising hersquod missed his breakfast TV programme. He picked up a pebble and dropped it into the water below, then watched the circles expand.ldquoWhere we going today  he asked.ldquoWell, letrsquos see how far we get, but right now we are heading for Balquhidder Kirk!ldquoWhere the minister who wrote the book on faeries was ldquoAye, but there is much more to its story.Izzy took her rucksack from the roof box.ldquoSo we are walking there ldquoYep, itrsquos really not far, his aunt replied.But Finn was wary. Her rucksack seemed suspiciously full for a short walk.They set off along the quiet single track road. The air buzzed with le and mooing from the cattle had replaced the sound of traffic. Soon they had crossed a small old bridge and were heading into a wood. They were at the base of Kirton Glen and the sound of a waterfall touched Finnrsquos senses.Izzy paused only briefly at the falls but Finn wanted to linger.ldquoWersquoll come back this way, and then we can spend some time here, she said.She pointed ahead of her: ldquoJust there, through the trees, is where we are headed. I always think this is the best way to approach this ancient place to emerge from a wood after being doused with the sound of running water, rather than just arrive from a car park and... well, yoursquoll see.The path opened up onto a gravel drive and a Victorian church. He followed Izzy round the corner of the church and found himself standing on the edge of an ancient graveyard.Old gravestones littered the ground, which was uneven. A gravestone in the form of an ancient Celtic cross stood out against the blue sky.Generation upon generation lay beneath his feet. The graves surrounded the ruins of a th-century kirk. The historic site was framed by distant mountains. His aunt was right about the approach Finn felt like Indiana Jones emerging from the jungle to discover a long-lost ruined temple.Izzy led Finn carefully past the graves and into the ruins, then through the open doorway of the old kirk. Before them were three old recumbent gravestones lying side by side, surrounded by a low metal railing.A modern-looking gravestone above the graves had an inscription: ldquoMacGregor Despite them.Finn read the smaller inscriptions. They told that these were the graves of Rob Roy, his we and two of his sons. Someone had laid flowers at the foot of the graves.ldquoHe was a legendary outlaw, explained Izzy, ldquoa member of the MacGregor clan, who were hunted like the wolf.ldquoWhy ldquoThe whole clan was outlawed, which is why there is that inscription, which means despite their persecution they survived. Rob Roy lived part of his le as a hunted man, some say he was the enemy of the rich and a defender of the poor. Irsquove heard him called Scotlandrsquos Robin Hood.ldquoSo he was a hero.ldquoWell, he is to some. But to others he was a villain, a thief and a nasty killer.ldquoWhich is true, was he a goodie or a baddie ldquoPerhaps a bit of both, depending on who you are and what you believe.ldquoWhat do you believe aunty  asked Finn. Izzy pursed her lips in thought.ldquoWell, I love the romantic stories about him, like how he gave the minister here a sheep and cow each year infor him not increasing his fees to the local people.ldquo The fact the animals were probably lted didnrsquot seem to bother the minister. People want these stories to be true because we want our heroes to be always heroic and good, and not disappoint us. But other stories show him in a very ugly light.ldquo I want him to be a hero, said Finn, ldquobut now I donrsquot know what to believe.ldquoPerhaps we can admit to ourselves that even our heroes arenrsquot always perfect and have flaws, and so sometimes they do the wrong things.Finn shrugged his shoulders: ldquoWhatrsquos flaws ldquoErm, an imperfection, or fault.Finn looked down and scuffed the ground with his boots. Izzy knew this was a challenge to how he saw the world.ldquoI want to show you something , she said.She led him to the edge of the graveyard, then pointed up at a rocky ridge which emerged from a wood on a steep brae above them.ldquoCan you see, up there, the clf face with the ledge above  Thatrsquos called Creag an Tuirc, which means the rock of the boar. It looks out over the glen and was the clan rallying point for the MacLarens who lived here. Itrsquos a special place, Irsquom hoping you will chum me up to it. I have snacks we can have when we get there.Finn looked unsure. It seemed a steep uphill walk.ldquoItrsquos a place that knows the secrets of this glen because itrsquos quietly seen everything.ldquoSecrets ldquoAye, like the mystery of Rob Royrsquos grave, and what really happened when those Buchanan clansmen arrived here looking for a fight.ldquoWhat mystery Izzy just gave Finn a teasing smile.ldquoAnd it gives you amazing views. she added.ldquoAs good as from that Celtic fort and the giantrsquos stone yesterday  asked Finn, who was wavering.ldquoIrsquod say even better.Finn ed her smile with a cheeky one: ldquoCan I have a snack now to give me energy Izzy chuckled: ldquoSure!She put her rucksack down, and took out a chocolate bar: ldquoHow about this Izzy pulled on her rucksack and started to walk out the graveyard. Finn followed while enjoying the bar.They walked together up the path that leads to Creag an Tuirc.Here are the links to chapters one, two, three, four and five."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-march-15-19-1996-1971-1921","story":"THE sea was ldquolashing buildings in Dunbar, reported the East Lothian Courier on March , .Dunbarrsquos pound. million improved sewerage system is blamed for a catalogue of disasters along the coastline.In , the regional council cut through four metres of rock to lay two new sets of pipes and, according to residents, the sea has been ldquolashing the buildings ndash causing considerable damage ndash ever since.They claim that the natural defences were never properly replaced after the construction work, leaving their homes exposed to the mercy of the high tides.Owner of The Courtyard Hotel and Restaurant, Peter Bramley, has made repeated complaints to the council since .ldquoSomethingrsquos got to be done, he said. ldquoItrsquos seriously affecting peoplersquos business and health.

MSPs wanted to know when the Scottish Government was advised it would likely lose the challenge raised by Mr Salmond, but ministers said handing over the advice would breach the ministerial code.On two occasions, MSPs voted for the evidence to be released, with a deal eventually being struck in December to reveal the advice only to MSPs on the committee.Following a vote of no confidence threat in the Deputy First Minister, the Scottish Government released ldquokey legal advice, but the Scottish Tories were not satisfied and continued in their bid to oust John Swinney, which ultimately failed.Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon separately sat for mammoth sessions in front of the committee, taking questions from MSPs over several hours.Didnrsquot Mr Salmond face trial on sexual misconduct charges Yes. The former first minister was cleared of  charges at the High Court in Edinburgh in March last year after being arrested in January .What were the issues with Mr Salmondrsquos evidence to the committee Mr Salmond and the committee have been caught in repeated legal wrangles over evidence published by the inquiry.Last month, the former first minister said he would not appear before the committee after it decided not to publish his submission to a separate investigation into whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code over fears it may identy some of the complainers in Mr Salmondrsquos criminal trial last year.However, an alteration made to a court order by Judge Lady Dorrian meant the evidence could potentially be made public.While the committee voted against publication, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Bodymade the decision to publish anyway.The evidence was online for less than  hours before the Crown Office raised concerns with Holyrood about it, asking for redactions to be made.In his submission, the former first minister accused some in the Scottish Government and SNP of a ldquomalicious and concerted attempt to damage my reputation and remove me from public le in Scotland.But Ms Sturgeon said her predecessor did not have ldquoa shred of evidence to support his claims.The submission was later re-released, with a number of paragraphs relating to the set-up of a meeting between Mr Salmond and his successor redacted.Is the committee inquiry the only investigation into the matter No. Ms Sturgeon is currently under investigation by James Hamilton QC to establishshe breached the ministerial code.Ms Sturgeon referred herself after being accused of misleading Parliament over when she knew of the complaints against Mr Salmond.She previously said she had been told about the allegations by Mr Salmond himself during a meeting in her home on April , .However, it was later found that Mr Salmondrsquos former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein had met with the First Minister in her Holyrood office four days prior to that, where she was told of the complaints.Scotlandrsquos first minister @NicolaSturgeon responds to @SkyNews exclusive the harassment committee has ruled she misled Parliament in her evidence.ldquoThe opposition members of this committee made their minds up about me before I uttered a single word of evidence. pic UNeUJsWhat has the committee concluded A leak on Thursday evening from inside the committee revealed it has concluded the First Minister misled the inquiry over whether she had offered to intervene in the case ndash which Ms Sturgeon denies doing.Two other witnesses, one of whom is Mr Salmondrsquos lawyer and former SNP MSP Duncan Hamilton and who was at the meeting in question, contradicted the First Ministerrsquos statement.The conclusion was arrived at following a - party line vote, with the four SNP members of the committee, including convener Linda Fabiani, supporting the First Ministerrsquos assertion.What happens next The decision is likely to increase pressure on Ms Sturgeon to stand down before Mayrsquos election, although it is unclear whether the act was deemed a resignation-worthy offence.Last night, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross called for her to quit.He said: ldquoThe committee will publish its findings in the coming days and we will wait for that report.ldquoBut we have already detailed that Nicola Sturgeon lied to the Scottish Parliament and for that, she must resign. All wersquore waiting for is confirmation.Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: ldquoI am not going to prejudge the outcome of the committee report and we await its findings, butit does conclude that the First Minister has misled Parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code then that is incredibly serious.A Scottish Parliament spokesperson said: \"Further to media reports on the Committeersquos findings, the Committee is still finalising its report.

After the frosts are gone, they can be grown from seed outdoors, either in pots or beds.Since lettuce can be ready to eat within as little as six weeks from sowing, itrsquos a good idea to sow a few seeds every week or two to ensure a continuous supply of salad throughout summer.For more experienced young gardeners, round carrots are a relatively quick crop that grow well in pots. Varieties like lsquoParis Marketrsquo produce tasty snacks that can be harvested - weeks from sowing.A slightly longer crop but nevertheless very popular is the pumpkin ndash sow the seeds now and theyrsquoll be a fine size for carving lanterns and making pumpkin pie in the autumn. Once they begin to fill out, they are fascinating to watch as they grow almost visibly from day to day!The choice of flower seeds is too extensive to list here, so wersquove highlighted three of the easiest and most rewarding to consider.Nasturtiums are possibly the most popular amongst flower seeds for young gardeners. These large seeds are easy for children to handle, can be germinated indoors during early spring and planted outdoors in pots or borders when the risk of frost is gone.Flowering from June right through to October, the flowers and leaves can be used in salads. By removing dead heads, repeat flowering is encouraged. They produce seed very easily and itrsquos entirely possible that you might find nasturtiums unexpectedly popping up again next year!The ever-popular poppy is another favourite and our recommendation here are the lsquoLittle Ladybirdrsquo poppies ndash with their black-spotted centres on bright red flowers, you can almost imagine that they are a family of ladybirds!When thinking about flowers that can be easily grown from seed, itrsquos impossible to ignore sweet peas.Try creating your very own sweet pea tepee with a few bamboos and some twine. Plant the sweet peas around the base of the tepee , then train the plants up and around as they grow to create a tent with living walls. With endless fragrant flowers and a tepee to play in, itrsquos sure to be a winner for all the family!For many of todayrsquos gardeners, their own plot in the garden is where their love of gardening first began.Whilst not every garden has the space to have a dedicated kids area, therersquos often room to let children grow things in containers.Why not set them the challenge of finding the most unusual colourful imaginative container and see what they come up with  Old toys, kitchen containers or even old shoes and boots can be fun containers to grow plants in and could be decorated to produce wonderfully inidual planters. Just make sure that theyrsquore clean before you begin, that they have sufficient drainage so that the plants donrsquot become waterlogged and that they will remain intact when watered.If you donrsquot have a garden, perhaps you could let them experiment with houseplants or a window box With so much evidence about the benefits to our wellbeing of gardening, introducing children to this wonderful pastime is certainly worth considering. You may be launching a future horticulturalist or simply helping them learn how gardening can help them remain healthy and well but itrsquos certainly worth having a go!Although we are currently closed due to Government guidance, our plant team are here in the garden centre caring for the plants and can be contacted by email at info@merryhatton or telephonefor help and advice.

side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine, however ministries across the globe have been quick to quash any fears saying that it is \"safe and effective\".Prime Minister Boris Johnson will receive the Oxford jabas he urges the country to get vaccinated.The news of Mr Johnson receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine comes as a host of European countries announced they would begin using the jab once again following new safety assurances.A number of countries including Germany and France have reversed their decision to temporarily pause the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine over blood clot concerns after the European Medicines Agencycalled the vaccine ldquosafe and effective.France, Italy and Germany, along with Cyprus, Latvia and Lithuania, have confirmed they will resume rollout of the Oxford shot on Friday.While Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands said they will follow suit next week, although Spain said it could exclude certain groups.But do you have a choice in the matter  Can you pick and choose which of the currently approved vaccines you are injected withyou have worries about a particular one Here is everything you need to know about it:No.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has not advised a preference between the Pfizer-BioNTech, the Oxford-AstraZeneca or any other vaccines in the UKpopulation, stating that \"both give very high protection against severe disease... and both vaccines have good safety profiles\".The UKrsquos vaccine programme is offering vaccines in line with the supply of vaccines, and so the option to choose is not availablesay the NHS.In certain circumstances, you may be advised to have a certain vaccine by a medical professional, but this is not common, and will be discussed with you fully before hand you cannot request a certain vaccine for yourself.Earlier this week, Northern Irelandrsquos Health Minister made clear people cannot pick and choose what type of Covid- vaccine they receive as he moved to provide reassurance on the safety of the AstraZeneca jab.Robin Swann highlighted that the UKrsquos Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyhad found no evidence of a link between the vaccine and reported cases of blood clots in some European countries.Asked whether people who had concerns about the AstraZeneca jab could select a dferent type of vaccine, Swann said, ldquotherersquos no opportunity to pick and choose vaccines within our current programme.You will have to have two doses of the same vaccine.The MHRA has concluded that any link between the jab and clots is unproven The World Health Organisationis urging countries to continue using the AstraZeneca Covid- vaccine as global medical leaders meet to discuss reports of blood clots.Dr Soumya Swaminathan, WHOrsquos chief scientist, told a media briefing ldquowe do not want people to panic, as she said no association has been found so far between blood clots and Covid- vaccines.She said the rates at which blood clots have occurred in people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine ldquoare in fact less than what you would expect in the general population.Professor Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said there was ldquono demonstrable dference in the number of blood clots seen between the general population and the  million who have so far received the Oxford AstraZeneca jab to date.He told BBC Breakfast ldquobecause wersquore immunising so many people, we are bound to see blood clots at the same time as the vaccination.ldquoThatrsquos not because they are due to the vaccination. Thatrsquos because they occur naturally in the population. We have to remember that there are , blood clots a month on average in the general population.ldquoOne ought to also remember that Covid causes blood clots, added Prof Harnden. ldquoSo, the risks of not having the Covid vaccination far outweigh the risks from the vaccinations.The EMA has concluded there is no overall increase in the risk of blood clots with the vaccine Of course, taking up the offer of a Covid- vaccine remains voluntary, and there are currently no plans to make being immunised.But members of the public are being urged to accept offers of a jab as soon as they can, and being reassured that all vaccines available are safe, and have been developed under the usual strict, regulatory practices.Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said the decision to pause rollout of the Oxford AstraZeneca jab could be a ldquodisaster for Covid- vaccine uptake in Europe.Asked what he would say to those in the UK who are booked to receive an Oxford jab, Prof Openshaw told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoI really wouldnrsquot be worried at the present time.ldquoI think it is very clear that the benefits of being vaccinated at the moment so far outweigh the possible concern over this rather rare type of blood clot, he added. ldquoI think it is a disaster for the vaccination uptake in Europe, which is already on slightly unsteady ground in some countries."},{"url":null,"title":"aldi-lidl-middle-aisles-available-sunday-march-21","story":"Weve rounded-up some of the highlights to look out for in each supermarket.AldiThis week, Aldi are looking ahead to Easterwith themed products and decorations offered at discount prices.These include:This inflatable bunny is available to spruce up your home in time for Easter.

That problem continues to pose concerns, not least over whether the sizeable gatherings outside Ibrox and in Glasgowrsquos George Square might be repeated, perhaps at the upcoming Old Firm match.I watched Celtic draw with Dundee United last weekend, a result which guaranteed the Premiership for Rangers. Football fans will perhaps understand that my first thought was that my team, United, now had virtually no chance of securing a top six place in the league, and thus avoiding a possible relegation battle. BRIAN TAYLOR:This is not a civil war in the SNP. This is more vicious and more visceralHowever, the wider consequences soon emerged as Rangers fans mustered to celebrate their teamrsquos success, in clear breach of rules prohibiting mass gatherings.Condemnation was swt from the First Minister, Opposition leaders and the police. While praising Rangersrsquo sporting achievement, they declared that the supportersrsquo actions were unacceptable and dangerous. They reminded us bluntly that closely packed crowds had the potential to spread disease and even death.Let us be clear. Parliament has the democratic power to prescribe rules. Within those rules, the police have a duty to proscribe behaviour which threatens the peace and, in this case, the health of citizens. Law and order must be maintained.The question is how. What is the truly effective way to prevent repetition  To do that, we need to understand the motivations underlying the behaviour we all witnessed.Otherwise, we risk making matters worse, we risk reinforcing a negative stereotype. To say this is in no way ndash I stress, in no way whatsoever ndash to condone the behaviour on display. It was dangerous and, potentially, deadly.Nicola Sturgeon has warned the Old FirmFirstly, I would broadly exculpate the police. You will hear it said either that they over-reacted or that they should have made far more arrests.The police did not create the situation. The fans gathered instinctively, emotively, no doubt prompted by social media. The police had to deal with events as they found them.An over-zealous response would have risked provoking the crowd, amplying the challenge to public order. Precisely the opposite of what the police were seeking to achieve.Secondly, consider the intrinsic nature of football support. We are dealing here with fans, or fanatics. For many, their le is defined by their vigorous adherence to their team. They exult in victory, they despair at defeat.This particular triumph for Rangers followed a decade without winning the league title a decade in which they had to rise from the lowest rank in Scottish football. In winning, they thwarted their greatest rivals.More generally, many fans regard their support for their team in an antithetical fashion to rival clubs, or even to society more generally. It is no accident that many supporters sing ldquonobody likes us, we donrsquot care. Their contrived self-image is as a beleaguered tribe, standing together against an external foe or an uncaring world.That is true of the most fervent of fans generally but it is particularly true of the Old Firm. Their adherents will often define themselves in contradistinction to the other side. Which can present a challenge for neutral observers or, indeed, for politicians seeking to intervene.Grimacing wryly, Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs this week that half of Glasgow presumed she was partisan for one side of the Old Firm while the other half presumed exactly the contrary. She was, she stressed, unconcerned about the colour of the shirt.It was also notable in Rangersrsquo official statement that they immediately drew attention to what they regarded as ldquoan unbalanced approach adopted towards their half of the Old Firm.In that same statement, Rangers insisted they had taken every step to pre-empt and deter such behaviour. It might be pertinent to note here that broader support for that analysis is distinctly limited. Further, eventhey were doing all they could, then those efforts demonstrably failed.Crucially, however, Rangers supporters will agree with their club. They will discern bias against them which others do not spot. Such a standpoint is not entirely unknown on the other side of the Glasgow sporting ide, nor indeed in football more generally. They are not known as fans for nothing. Once again, that does not remotely exonerate the behaviour we witnessed.However, it is also the case that there are many Rangers fans who will regret the scenes witnessed, who will seek to dispel any bad odour lingering around their clubrsquos remarkable success. As The Herald reported, supportersrsquo groups have raised thousands of pounds to repair damaged benches in George Square.Equally, though, those of us who are football fans need to reflect that many, perhaps most, people in Scotland are not. BRIAN TAYLOR:Sturgeonrsquos inquiry performance was thorough, respectful, controlled and capableRemember Brenda from Bristol  On being told that a further General Election was pending, she replied: ldquoYoursquore joking! What, another one !Translate that from Brendarsquos broad Bristol accent into Scots, and you have it pat. For many in Scotland, their reaction to another controversy in football is ennui. They find it weary, stale and flat full of sound and fury and signying nothing.In that light, we now need action which will be effective, rather than simply voluble. Perhaps a promise of substantial celebrations deferred, linked to the warning that the Old Firm game may have to be cancelled. Perhaps a reminder of possible sanctions by the European football authority.It will not be sufficient for that message to be delivered solely by politicians. Still less, by the police. That will not work with the truly zealous.Football leaders must douse their instinctive indignation and urge compliance. Consistently and without equivocation. In tandem with politicians and the police. It may be exasperating that such effort is required but anything  risks further failure. Understand, then act.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Focus on fractalsLook out for fractals - naturally occurring patterns abundant in nature, in flowers, pine cones, clouds and sea shells, Loveday suggests.\"Look at whats around you as you connect with nature in whatever space you have available to you, to take in fractals. A pine cone, which has a repetitive pattern that recurs on a progressively finer scale to create shapes of enormous complexity, is a great example,\" she explains.\"Noticing the patterns is a great hook to anchor mindfulness practice on, because it brings you into the present moment. You are consciously, deliberately seeking out patterns in the natural environment.\"Those patterns can help us lower our stress levels, she says. Colours can also be good hooks for mindfulness and positivity. \"Really draw on the colour of spring blooms, particularly daffodils, rhododendrons, bluebells and magnolias,\" she advises.. Listen out for garden sounds\"There is evidence that sound has potential restorative effects for wellbeing,\" says Loveday. \"It can help restore you from a feeling of cognitive fatigue.\" Especially she notes, when we are spending so much longer looking at screens because of remote working and connecting with loved ones online.Recent research by Dr Eleanor Ratclfe, at the University of Surrey, has found that bird sounds in particular can offer relief from mental fatigue and stress. So stand still and listen to the birds, to gently flowing water, or to the sway of leaves in the breeze. \"Listen and enjoy the dawn chorus for that sense of waking up and the joy of spring,\" Loveday adds.. Dip into forest bathing\"There is evidence coming from Japan about the benefits of forest bathing,\" notes Loveday. \"Familiarise yourself with the trees in your immediate space. They release a chemical called phytoncides, which can have a positive effect on our immune system and mood. Evenyou cant hug each other, you can hug trees.\". Peruse pollinators\"Spring is a great time to make your garden a haven for pollinators. Get creative with caterpillar food plants and nectar-rich flowers. The more you grow in your garden, once youve invested that bit of effort, you can sit back and enjoy the show - the butterflies, moths and bees,\" says Loveday.\"Its another way of bringing you into the present moment and connecting you with wildle. And giving back - helping conservation - is very good for humans.\". Grow herbs\"From research, we know that botanical scents, such as those of rosemary and mint, have a powerful, emotive influence on us. Rosemary can enhance alertness and quality of memory, reduce anxiety and improve mood,\" says Loveday, while \"small studies show that peppermint can enhance attention, alertness and performance, and reduces stress.\". Walk barefoot on the grass\"Grounding and connecting with your bare feet through the earth can make you feel better,\" says Loveday. So start your day by going into the garden and walking barefoot on the grass.Also known as Earthing, this can also include walking barefoot on soil, sand or any natural surface, and benefits can include reduced inflammation and improved sleep. Just make sure you only walk where its safe to do so and there are no potentially sharp objects underfoot.Early studies have found the planet has its own natural charge and we seem to do better when we are in direct contact with it, according to experts at Heligan.. Take green exercise\"The University of Exeter surveyed around , people and found that people who spend time in the garden are signicantly more likely to report general good health and psychological wellbeing and were % more likely to meet activity guidelines than people who didnt spend time in the garden,\" Loveday notes. Other evidence shows that exercising in natural environments can help decrease tension, anger, depression and confusion, and increase energy and positivity."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-preview-house-pits-homeowners-actors-part-ultimate-bluffing-competition","story":"Proof that a simple idea can often be the most effective, brand new BBC One show This Is MY House poses that very question.Pitting one homeowner against three actors, all four contestants must set out to convince a celebrity  that the house they are standing in is in fact theirs.Hosted by presenter and former Strictly Come Dancing champion Stacey Dooley, This Is MY House can only be described as Would I Lie To You but with a property-themed twist.\"Its really daft and fun, its total escapism,\" says -year-old Dooley.\"My favourite part is when you meet the partner, and they stay mute, but you have three strangers declaring their undying love for this person.\"Its so awkward, the real homeowner has to watch these strangers tell their husband or we how gorgeous they are.\"It is a change of pace for Dooley, who is far more likely to be found tackling hard-hitting documentary projects than hosting a primetime entertainment show.\"Weve all had such a hellish time and everyone has had such an unbearable year, and this show is just such a laugh.\"Were all wired with these prejudices and unconscious biases, and find ourselves automatically judging people, so I love the fact the show breaks down those boundaries and it goes against the grain.\"Right at the start when I signed up, I said I didnt want to know who the homeowner was or who the actors were, so I could play along as we filmed.\"At the end of filming when the actors broke character, it was so interesting hearing about their real selves.\"So I love how the show goes against everything you know.\"Featuring a celebrity  composed of comedians Bill Bailey, Emily Atack, Jamali Maddix and Judi Love, This Is MY House is a show packed full of laughs and awkward moments in equal measure.As the lists are drip fed clues and questioned by Dooley throughout the episode, the four celebrities sit back and confer as to who the real homeowner is.\"Emily is a total sweetheart, I have never worked with her before so that was lovely,\" says Dooley.\"Judi is a scream, she is so funny Bill is the kindest man in television, he bought me a cake on the last day of filming, and Jamali reminds me of the lads I grew up with which was really lovely.\"Jamali had the best eye for honesty though, nothing got past him, he is so sharp.\"Testing the comedians judgment to the limit, the series is at its funniest when the celebrities are convinced of the imposter, only to get it terribly wrong.\"It was interesting because I think we all thought wed be really good judges of character and figure it out straightaway, but it was so much harder than we thought,\" says Attack, .\"The more we filmed, the more we thought we could figure it out and learn from the last.\"It was quite funny when there were pets involved because we just assumed they would run straight to the owner, but they often didnt.\"The dog was just generally confused as to why a load of strangers were in its owners bedroom.\"Jamali should actually be a detective, he got really stuck in with finding out the real homeowners, his commitment was really impressive.\"\"Essentially Im a lie detector,\" chimes in fellow list Maddix, .And with a cash prize up for grabs, there is more than just pride at stake.If the homeowner convinces the  the house is theirs, they walk away with a pound, prize.

It is not unwarranted.There is little doubt that the SNP ndash the most proficient electoral machine in the UK for the last  years ndash is in the midst of a major wobble. The most obvious exhibit is the twin inquiries into the Alex Salmond debacle the Parliamentary one, which reports this morning, and more importantly from First Minister Nicola Sturgeonrsquos perspective, that by independent QC James Hamilton which reported yesterday. ANDY MACIVER:Why Rangers fans like me despair of our clubHowever there is more. There are policy schisms about the independence strategy and, perhaps even more fracturingly, the transgender rights debate, along with a series of public scandals. The SNP used to make a living out of selling the narrative of Scottish exceptionalism, implying that such things only happened to Tories at Westminster. No more.However for unionists, and for Tories in particular, one swallow doesnrsquot make a summer. Indeed, Irsquod urge them not only to proceed with caution, but to glean the right messages from the polling data they see, rather than simply grabbing the ones most convenient to the arguments they want to make.I have little doubt that the upturn in unionist fortunes, which more often than not has been accompanied by an uptick in Scottish Tory voting intentions, is in part down to the negative attention around the First Minister and her party.However the polling data tells us, quite clearly, that although the Holyrood committee inquiry is of enormous interest to almost all voters, its politicisation means it is a motivator to a rather smaller subset of the population.More importantly, yesterdayrsquos exoneration by Mr Hamilton is likely to carry a far heavier and more enduring weight with persuadable voters, with its impartiality from the political process.Former First Minister Alex SalmondUnionists would also do well to remember that the SNP is in the eye of the storm, right now, and yet still amasses around % of the vote in most polls, and remains in with a fighting chance of a majority government in a system rigged against it.Rather curiously, the Tories are actually selling themselves short. Because, it seems clear to me, that at least as much of the polling sht is down to a more positive sentiment towards them rather than a negative sentiment towards their opponents.UK-wide polling is currently rosy for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is now regularly skelping his opposite number Sir Keir Starmer in head-to-head polls, with a commensurate healthy lead for his party. This is being reflected not just in England but across the UK.Why might this be  Let us think might it be because right now we are living through the covid vaccine rollout, which is simultaneously the best advert for unionism in the history of devolution, and the best argument so far for Brexit In Scotland, the Tories are in urgent need of both ndash a key benefit of the UK and a key benefit of Brexit ndash and yet when presented with one of the sort that they will never see again, they seem more comfortable focussing on the negatives of nationalism rather than the benefits of the union.This strategy is proving to be red meat to a growing group of young-ish thinkers in London, who are seeking to exert their influence on Downing Streetrsquos approach towards the future of the UK. These enthusiastic chaps are self-styled lsquodevo-scepticsrsquo, whose ultimate aim is to reverse devolution andthe UK to a unitary state model.I understand the source of their angst. The Scottish Parliament has, largely, not delivered spectacular results for Scots. There are precious few areas, and most of them niche, where someone of an independent mind like me can fairly say Holyrood has transformed our lives.Nonetheless, the fault of that does not lie with the institution of devolution. There is no clamour, in, say, Canada or Australia, for the closure of provincial legislatures as a result of bad performance. They donrsquot close the business they change the management.And with an excruciatingly small subset of the Scottish population in favour of the closure of the Scottish Parliament, it is critical for the future of Scotlandrsquos Tories that their leader, Douglas Ross, gets a grip on this hysterical unionist underbelly in London and places his hand over their collective mouths. They are people who, in their exuberant but ultimately ill-informed unionism, will in fact be the midwives of independence.Instead, Irsquod urge Mr Ross to take the right messages being given to him by the opinion polls. Firstly, he should diagnose the problem of the last decade not as the nationalists doing well , but as the Scottish people losing their faith in the UK.That has always been the problem, and the transient drama currently swirling around the SNP will do nothing to reverse that long-term drt. ANDY MACIVER:I simply cannot equate the country the Sussexes describe to the country in which I liveHe should restore faith by focussing on the vaccine rollout, right now, and perhaps also comparing Englandrsquos Covid unlocking with Scotlandrsquos. And more broadly, by talking about the little ripples of unionist hope that the UK is creating through initiatives such as the levelling-up agenda and direct financial intervention in Scotland ndash without question the smartest political move the Scotland Office has made in  years.If the Scottish Tories want to encourage lasting movement from Yes to No, rather than simply a knee-jerk reaction to current events, they need to stop selling the negatives of nationalism, and start selling the positives of unionism in this irreversible age of devolution.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-make-hybrid-working","story":"As vaccination plans continue to roll out, organisations must embrace the \"new normal\" and decide how they can make it work within their own models. This can be achieved with the application of collaborative and agile technologies to transform what was originally an enforced situation into a long term and mutually beneficial hybrid approach.However, as we make this sht, there is a heightened organisational risk for companies that have not invested in making their employee environments as best equipped as possible. Pre-pandemic, some offices were already using sensors to monitor things like Indoor Environment Quality , CO levels, lighting, and air flow to ensure staff members were healthy and comfortable within an environment that promotes optimum productivity, and this will be even more important going forward.Alongside avoiding the challenge of occupational hazards, organisations must acknowledge the heightened cybersecurity risk within their resilience strategy. With employees working from home on vulnerable home routers and multiple family members using the same network, the threat of socially engineered external threats alone is extremely high. To combat this, medium and large enterprises must review their outsourcing models, implementing additional IT and technology partnerships, particularly as the traditional skill matrix for IT workers evolves ndash perhaps including the assessment of home set-ups and reviewing cybersecurity on a case-by-case basis.Historically, the UK has been referred to as the \"sick man of Europe\", with signicantly less productivity than our European competitors.

She rightly wanted to hit a nerve when it comes to how women are treated on one hand and men on the other.The argument, inevitably, was stripped online of nuance and weaponised by culture warriors screaming ndash at the least appropriate time ndash of \"feminazis.Signicantly, Baroness Jones was speaking after tone-deaf comments from police in London who told women ldquonot to go out alone.Read more: Sarah Everard: Reclaim These Streets movementThink of the ugly stupidity of such comments: after a woman is killed, a suggested police solution is that other women stay indoors. Effectively, itrsquos a womenrsquos curfew. As Baroness Jones pointed out, nobody seemed to ldquobat an eyelid in response.She did respond, though, and with old-fashioned rhetoric ndash \"why donrsquot men stay indoors instead \" ndash making an important point about the dferent ways in which society treats the sexes. The rage which greeted her curfew comments rather proved her point.Nobody, clearly, should be under a curfew, men or women, but Baroness Jones raised an issue which struck home with me, deeply, personally. We men need to start talking about the fact that women have every reason to be scared when they see one of us, a stranger, on the streets at night, because men kill women. That is the horrible, inescapable, truth.I like walking at night near my home ndash as a writer it lets me think. But over the years Irsquove come to do it less and less. I realised that the sight of me, a big guy, looming out of the dark alone could easily be frightening for many women.It worried me for a long time that I might unwittingly scare women, so I modied my behaviour. Now,I go walking at night, Irsquoll ask my we or one of my daughters to come along.Irsquom attuned to the fear of violence. I was raised in a rough, poor area with a lot of street crime, and ended up in hospital quite a few times after being attacked, so Im acutely aware of my own safety at night.It dawned on me long, long ago that my fears must be small in comparison to most women. If Irsquom sometimes extra-vigilant at night, particularlyIrsquom walking through a strange city, and maybe slip the sharp end of a set of keys through my fingers, so theyrsquoll go in the eye of anyone who attacks me ndash how must women feel I say \"women\", not \"some women\", because there are very few women I know who havenrsquot been subjected to violence or sexually aggressive behaviour from men. I first realised just how endemic male violence was when I was  and fresh into university. A close friend told me that shersquod been raped by her employer during the summer holidays. Then another friend told me of her attack, and slowly but surely over the years nearly all of the women who Irsquove been close to had similar experiences. Itrsquos a mountain of horror ndash and itrsquos only men to blame, therersquos no way around that fact.Itrsquos a terrible thing, as a man, to hear the memories of women you care about, telling of the pain and suffering caused by other men. I canrsquot help but share a feeling of collective guilt. Itrsquos never the right time to use expressions like \"not all men\", in my view.Predictably, the debate which Baroness Jones was trying to start about the fear women experience at night and the disparity with which menrsquos concerns and womenrsquos concerns are treated by society as a whole disappeared in an inevitable wave of social media screeching.Ten years ago, wersquod have discussed as a society the intricacies of what she was trying, sarcastically, to get at. Today, therersquos  hours of social media hysteria, then we move on to something . That fails all women. Evidently, evenwersquod collectively been intelligent enough to attempt a sensible discussion about what Baroness Jones said, it was never going to end up in a curfew for men ndash we know that ndash but a thoughtful debate might at least have meant that more men became more aware of the fears women have around their safety at night.In truth, the death of Sarah Everard raised a host of issues which we need to talk about but arenrsquot doing so because heat and rage have taken the place of debate, and therersquos no longer scope for sustained discussion thanks to social media.After the killing, there was a flood of reports about criminal behaviour by police towards women, including allegations of violence and rape, and the turning of blind eyes and pathetic punishments.Today, we should be talking about how police select recruits. How are candidates psychologically profiled  How thorough are background checks  How continuously are officers risk assessed Wersquore not having that discussion because today we donrsquot do discussion. Think back to some of the most dreadful crimes in recent memory and itrsquos clear that until lately we noted the failings each crime highlighted, debated how to make the country safer, and acted accordingly.The  Soham case, for instance, in which two young girls were murdered, led to prolonged, widespread debate which prompted a number of important changes that improved the safety system set up to protect children.Wersquove lost the art of listening. As a first step, men need to start hearing what women are saying. Itrsquos not about listening to our wives and daughters, or mothers and sisters. Itrsquos about listening to the women we donrsquot know ndash and extending the same kind of empathy we have for the women in our lives to all women everywhere."},{"url":null,"title":"beauty-beasts-garden-country-life-rosemary-goring","story":"For earthworms, first light must bring what feels like the Blitz. I donrsquot know how fast a worm can burrow, but while submarines could quickly plunge to a safe depth, I fear our worms have been trained by snails, hence the abundance of blackbirds with generous waistlines and glossy feathers.Well-nourished, they shoot past the window in a blur, fizzing with energy. At breakfast this morning I was pleased to see that one very fat male was taking a break. From his perch in our neighbourrsquos apple tree he kept one eye on our newly budded daffodils, the other on the street.I took time to appreciate him more fully than usually, and not just because he was a beautul specimen. This past fortnight, while gardening, I have come upon the miserable sight of blue-tit down and feathers, snagged among the snowdrops and roses by our beech hedge. Caught on thorns, these blue and yellow scraps fluttered like Lilliputian rags. They were witness, I assumed, to a predatory cat. The wide hedge on both sides of the garden is home to hundreds of birds, but at this particular spot their cover is less dense, and the fence not wholly engulfed by beech. Would a cat leap onto it to snatch birds from their roost  Might something  After the third killing, I noticed indentations in the newly dug earth, where the day before I had been extending the flowerbed. They might possibly have been made by a cat, but seemed a little too deep. The roses I planted there, intended to keep bird snatchers at bay, have so far grown up rather than out. This summer I hope they will have a growth spurt and turn themselves into an impenetrable shield. While the flowers of the rosa rugosa are delicate, its thorns are the horticultural equivalent of razor wire. The species was recommended to me by a former headteacher, who had found it a useful deterrent in the school grounds, warding off students inclined to stray out of bounds.A recent study has shown that blue tits which call upon other tits to help raise their young live two or three years longer than those who do all the chick-care themselves. Who knew birds could be middle-class  Nor is it simply delegating that marks them out as lofty. Just as it is now the ultimate status symbol to have a large family ndash raised by an army of extras ndash these upwardly mobile tits, being less exhausted, produce brood after brood. In so doing, they help the tit fraternity flourish. Itrsquos as fine an example of having your cake and eating it as you could hope to find.Our casualties, sadly, were possibly caught sleeping too soundly after the rigours of mating and nest-building. Checking by the roses over the next few days, I found a chaffinch had also perished. Inspecting the remains of its striped plumage, I reflected that, much as I love cats, it would be impossible ever to have one again, because of the harm they do. Those of us with gardens might think they are ours, to fill with pets as we choose, but this is not the case. If ever Irsquom in doubt, the cacophony of birdsong, the red arrow displays of hawks, the sparrow shuttlecocks, the cheerleading bouncing of finches on the uppermost branches, the lumbering woodpigeons making trees shake as they lt off, in short the superabundance of avian activity, reminds me of whose domain it really is.A garden can also be wild. Yesterday, on my way to the shed for a spade, I noticed a patch of earth that appeared to be moving in the breeze. On closer examination, the area where Alanrsquos garlic is coming up nicely had been turned into a black carpet of downy feathers. It was rippling asalive, and in its midst was the bitten-off head of a male blackbird. The severed stump was bloody. It seemed asthe bird had either tried to fight off its attacker, or been plucked like a Christmas turkey before being carried off.Nearby was buckled chicken wire, where some nocturnal intruder had entered. I pinned a boulder on it, but the next morning it had been pushed aside, and the chicken wire once again gaped. This didnrsquot look like a catrsquos doing. The tomcat that lives nearest us has a ritual route, using the wall near our oil tanker for entry and exit, often triggering our security light in the process. Then, in the freshly dug earth, I found badger prints, like the tracks of a small bear. But would a badger be fast enough to snare a bird  I suppose it might have been an owl, but normally it would discard feet as well as head.I think I know the answer. Early last summer, as readers might recall, we found the buried headless corpse of a pheasant in a flowerbed, stashed there by a fox for retrieval at a later point. I checked to seethe blackbirdrsquos body had been hidden, but found nothing. I could camp out in the summerhouse one night, with a torch, to seea fox s, but the thought doesnrsquot appeal.The sad truth is that, while these birds feel like the heart of the garden, they take their chances along with everything . If any of our roster of airborne residents was an endangered species, it would be tragic to see them picked off. Yet to hear the cacophony of blackbirds chanting and the chirping of finches and tits each morning is deeply reassuring. Despite the best efforts of foxes, cats, owls, or whatever other assassins go hunting during the hours of darkness, they seem to be thriving."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-verdict-trust-one-sturgeons-peers","story":"And to those who are now telling us that Nicola Sturgeon has proven herself to be the best-est and most truthful politician the world has ever seen, I say two things.The first point is that when faced with a verdict from a hand-picked unelected pillar of the establishment taking evidence in private and one from elected representatives from a broad range of parties meeting in public, I would always choose the latter. I would also suggest imaginingthe person under scrutiny was Boris Johnson:a judge he appointed for the purpose cleared him and a cross-party Parliamentary Select Committee condemned him, which would we consider to be a whitewash and which to be a more valid outcome The second point is that in  and for many years before, all of those people who are now so convinced of Ms Sturgeons probity were in the same way convinced that her predecessor was a jolly fine well-met chap who could be trusted too.

But wasnrsquot it always likely to be party political when it comprised only party politicians  If Ms Sturgeon had really wanted a non-partisan inquiry, she should have appointed a judge-led one, with full judicial powers and penalties at its disposal. It is not yet too late to have such an inquiry.This is just another blunder made by Ms Sturgeon throughout this whole affair. Her supporters may crow about her having been found by James Hamilton not to have breached the ministerial code. But is this the best Scotland can do  To have a Government which has been shown up as thoroughly incompetent  Is that really a recommendation for voters in May Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.TOP TORIES AVOIDING VOTERSMIKE Wilson is right to draw attention to Ruth Davidson and Douglas Ross for dispensing blame before even considering the evidence. And Mr Ross is at it again today. He is reported as saying, in the aftermath of an independent report exonerating the First Minister : \"Either we respect the fundamental principles of democracy or we dont.\" So lets take him at his word.Mr Ross allegedly leads the Scottish Conservatives but there is no such independent party, it is merely a branch of the UK Conservative and Unionist Party. Therefore his leader is Boris Johnson. When have we heard Mr Ross lecturing Mr Johnson on the fundamental principles of democracy  And Mr Ross will, since the founding of the Scottish Parliament, be the first leader representing a major party not to put himself up for election in a constituency. He is relying instead on the proportional representation system his party fought against for many years. Is he frightened of rejection by the electorate Ruth Davidson, memorably described by Mike Wilson as pompous, almost pious, is no better. One can completely understand her desire to escape politics to devote more time to her family but then she accepts a political job in London,  miles away which,done properly, will take her away from her family for even longer. Moreover, she accepts this job from Mr Johnson, a politician she has candidly admitted is low in her regard. We are told she will be used in the fight against independence, a sort of unionist Mons Meg siege cannon to be brought out when necessary, but she will no longer have a democratic base for her interventions.Mr Ross and Ms Davidson are rapidly becoming the Holy Willies of politics, laughably protesting the almost non-existent virtues of their own party whilst searching eagerly for faults in others.They are the ones ignoring one of the fundamental principles of democracy, namely when in a hole, stop digging.Ian McKee, Edinburgh.THE SYSTEM IS LETTING US DOWNI AGREE with much of Mike Wilsonrsquos well-argued letter, not only in his condemnation of Ruth Davidsonrsquos and Douglas Rossrsquos attempts to have the First Minister judged guilty before even having a chance to make her case, but also with his conclusion that the people of Scotland not only deserve but demand better, according to what we were promised on September , .The most revealing part of his letter, however, is where, in comparing the actions of Scottish opposition politicians to the ldquomisanthropic and cynical proceedings at Westminster, and their consequent shaming of Scotland, he correctly, though critically, ascribes their unacceptably partisan behaviour to their being ldquodenied the taste of power they crave.Given that the current Scottish electoral system, admittedly much fairer than that for Westminster, was designed, in the interests of ldquoconstructive debate and collegiate working, to avert the likelihood of one party having an overall majority ndash and given that this system has never, as originally promised, been subsequently reviewed and is clearly not working ndash it is understandable,not excusable, that elements of the failings of Westminster are evident here in Scotland.From our experience of the last  years we need a revision of the present system to one which delivers a more accurate and proportionate reflection of the will of the Scottish people. If the SNP, as appears possible, wins a majority in May, it will claim the election result as equivalent to a referendum in favour of independence, which on several counts it will not be.At present I, and many others like me, am unrepresented, either in my constituency, or in my region, by the person or the party I voted for. While all systems have their disadvantages, there is here a democratic deficit which is unjust as well as fundamentally failing. It is time for a review, which would also be setting a long-overdue example to Westminster.

a move widely condemned by opposition parties.Ahead of the asylum plan launch today, Ms Patel said: ldquoIf people arrive illegally, they will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive legally, and it will be harder for them to stay.ldquoIf, like over  per cent of illegal arrivals, they have travelled through a safe country like France to get here, they will not have immediate entry into the asylum system ndash which is what happens today.ldquoAnd we will stop the most unscrupulous abusing the system by posing as children, by introducing tougher, more accurate age assessments.ldquoProfiteering from illegal migration to Britain will no longer be worth the risk, with new maximum le sentences for people smugglers.ldquoI make no apology for these actions being firm, but as they will also save lives and target people smugglers, they are also undeniably fair.:Scottish islands firmly \"on the table\" for Priti Patels asylum detention centre plansAccess to benefits and family reunion rights could be limited while the appeals and judicial process will be reformed to ldquospeed up removals for those whose claims are refused.The Government said it would continue to welcome refugees and help them build a le in the UK, with the Home Secretary having the ability to offer protection to vulnerable people in ldquoimmediate danger and at risk in their home country.But the measures, anticipated to be brought forward as part of a Sovereign Borders Bill, will also make it ldquomuch harder for people to be granted refugee status based on unsubstantiated claims and include ldquorigorous age assessments to stop adult migrants pretending to be children.Tougher laws will be introduced to ldquowithhold protection and remove dangerous criminals, even when they improperly claim to be victims of modern slavery, the Home Office added.Le sentences will be brought in for people smugglers, harsher offences will be imposed on people trying to enter the country illegally and foreign criminals who breach deportation orders andto the UK could be jailed for up to five years instead of the current six months.A new ldquoone-stop legal process is also proposed, so asylum, human rights claims and any other protection matters are all made and considered together ahead of appeal hearings.Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, accused the Government of ldquoseeking to unjustly dferentiate between the deserving and undeserving refugee by choosing to provide protection for those fleeing war and terror based on how they travel to the UK and claimed the plans could undermine the countryrsquos traditions of providing protection for people ldquoregardless of how they have managed to find their way to our shores.Kolbassia Haoussou, of Freedom from Torture, warned the proposals could see most of the people the charity helps become ldquocriminalised, adding: ldquoThese unreal proposals make it clear that this Government isnrsquot serious about improving lives and creating a fair asylum system."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-shines-light-remember-lost-covid","story":"Poignantly, families gathered on their doorsteps shining a candle, while some of Scotlandrsquos key landmarks were illuminated in yellow, a colour which has come to signy a loved one lost to Covid, on National Day of Reflection.Earlier in the day a minutersquos silence was held across the nation.

However, there is still a lot more to do.ldquoToo many people are still tragically dying waiting for a transplant and too many others are still waiting too long for their transplant.ldquoThe opt-out law change is one of many initiatives under way to help deliver improvements and the measures set out in this plan will contribute further.ldquoThe Scottish Government is confident the package of measures included in the plan ndash both new recommendations and initiatives already started ndash will enable us to continue to save and improve the lives of those on the waiting list by increasing the numbers of transplants over the next five years.The plan recommends that renal units are asked to make a living donor transplant the default option for patients waiting for their first kidney transplant.It emphasises that it is ldquovitally important that no-one feels in any way pressured into becoming a living donor.:Scotlands new transplant system: The hurdles and ethical dilemmasYet the plan stresses that viable living donations should be the first option explored and encouraged, before considering a deceased donor transplant.It also recommends using novel technologies to boost the number of viable organs for transplantation.The plan maintainsthat transplant units need to continue working with all NHS boards to increase equity of access to transplantation across Scotland.It underlinesthe importance of diagnosing organ failure early and ldquofactors such as where someone lives doesnrsquot affect their chances of being referred for a transplant.The co-chairs of the Scottish Donation and Transplant Group, John Casey and Dr Iain Macleod, said: ldquoThe new action plan will build on the progress made in recent years to improve transplantation and organ donation in Scotland.ldquoIt contains key elements which will improve the lives and experiences of patients and, as such, we very much welcome its introduction."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-announces-legal-action-scotlands-top-civil-servant","story":"The former First Minister said he will also report the leak of the Scottish Governments original investigation into harassment complaints made against him to the police.In a statement, he said Leslie Evans, the Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Government, \"refuses to accept real responsibility\" for the botched handling of the probe.He added: \"This cannot stand. I have therefore taken legal advice and will shortly be instructing my lawyers to bring proceedings in the Court of Session arising as a direct result of the conduct of the Permanent Secretary.\"I hope it is the only legal action that I am required to take.\"The details of the planned court action are not yet clear.Mr Salmond previously won a judicial review case against the Scottish Government.Two inquiries published their findings in recent days, with Irish lawyer James Hamilton ruling that Nicola Sturgeon did not breach the ministerial code over the saga, while a separate, cross-party Holyrood committeefound the First Minister misled parliament.The committee also found the Scottish Government was responsible for multiple, serious flaws in its handling of harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond.In a damning -page report, it condemned the Governments \"prolonged, expensive and unsuccessful\" defence of Mr Salmonds subsequent judicial review, and insisted those responsible should be held accountable.It singled Ms Evans out for strong criticism, insisting there was an \"inidual failing\" on her part.The committee was looking at how the Scottish Government bungled its probe into sexual misconduct allegations made against Mr Salmond in .The former first minister had the exercise set aside in a judicial review after the Government conceded it had been \"tainted by apparent bias\" because of prior contact between investigating officer Judith Mackinnon and two of the women who made complaints.Mr Salmond was awarded a maximum payout of pound,.His statement reads: \"The inquiries are over and despite their manest limitations, the findings are in and must be accepted, just like the verdicts of juries and the judgements of courts.\"A year ago, outside the High Court, I said that there was evidence which I wished to see the light of day.\"Some of that key material, including the government legal advice, eventually emerged through the parliamentary committee. Much of it did not.\"A month ago, I gave public evidence to the parliamentary inquiry itself. I called for some in leadership positions to consider their position.\"It is in the public interest that such action be taken to prevent a damaging erosion of trust in the institutions of government. As the record shows I did not call for the resignation of the First Minister.\"I have waited to see the response from those iniduals to the publication of the inquiry reports. Unfortunately, it appears that the clear intention is to carry on regardless.\"Thus I intend to take two specic actions which emerge directly from the findings of these reports.\"First, the parliamentary committee has made clear that the catastrophic failures in this matter are not just systemic, but can properly be laid at the door of iniduals, and in particular, the Permanent Secretary.\"I was previously forced to take the Permanent Secretary to the Court of Session over the illegality of her actions and was successful.\"Despite being found responsible for that unlawful and unfair process and incurring a vast and avoidable cost to the taxpayer of over pound, in legal expenses, the Permanent Secretary did not offer her resignation on January , .\"Now, more than two years later, and despite the most damning condemnation from a committee in the history of the modern Scottish Parliament, the Permanent Secretary still refuses to accept real responsibility.\"Instead, the waste of public resources has continued to grow as has the impact on all the people concerned.\"This cannot stand. I have therefore taken legal advice and will shortly be instructing my lawyers to bring proceedings in the Court of Session arising as a direct result of the conduct of the Permanent Secretary. I hope it is the only legal action that I am required to take.\"I have complete faith in the outcome of that court process, coming as it does with all the proper powers of recovery of documents and thus the ability to properly interrogate those iniduals responsible, the absence of which so restricted the parliamentary committee. \"Secondly, the report of Mr James Hamilton makes clear that the question of the leak of the story of the original complaints in August  was not part of his remit but should instead be referred to the police.\"The parliamentary committee report was fully condemnatory of that same leak noting the extreme level of damage to all concerned. I agree.\"I will accordingly now make that complaint to the police and allow them to discover who within the Scottish Government was responsible for passing these details to the Daily Record newspaper.\"I have every confidence that Police Scotland will pursue that matter with rigour.\"I intend to make no further public comment on these issues and will leave the police and the courts to do their job.\"Instead I intend to move on, just as Scotland should now move on to debate the key election issues before us all, principally economic recovery from the pandemic and the future independence of our country.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12443351.jpg?type=article-full","title":"deer-scotland-landowners-face-legal-action-not-cull-animals","story":"Scottish Government ministers have accepted that majority of the recommendations of the independent Deer Working Group, including the setting up of a planned cull approval system.This is expected to mean government agency Naturescot setting enforceable annual cull targets, requiring landed estates to thin out the herds roaming their lands.However, plans to extend the hunting season on female deer, which would have resulted in pregnant animals being hunted, have been rejected for now.:Scottish deer calves could starve to deathmothers shotUpto around , deer are thought to be living in Scotland from four species - Roe, Red, Sika and Fallow - and a concentrated effort is underway to bring their numbers down.The animals are being blamed for hampering reforestation efforts by destroying new growth, putting climate change targets in jeopardy.Deer in Glencoe have become accustomed to peopleThe Scottish Government has accepted recommendations to reduce the number ofdeer to  per square kilometre in the Highlands.Other plans includephasing out the use of lead ammunition to cull deer, modernisation of existing deer legislation, the development of robust deer management plans and enhanced monitoring of deer numbers.The proposals will now formthe basis of new legislation to be brought forward in the next parliament.Rural Affairs and Natural Environment Minister Ben Macpherson said: ldquoAs the scale of tackling climate change and the bioersity crisis increases, and the measures needed to address these challenges become ever more necessary, it is evident that a signicant stepping-up of deer management efforts are required.ldquoIn considering our response to the Deer Working Grouprsquos recommendations, the impacts of deer on our climate change targets and on bioersity have been the main drivers of our policy on deer management alongside their socio-economic value as a resource and as a much-loved and iconic species, forming part of the Scottish rural environment, character and landscape.ldquoThe report also makes recommendations intended to improve the welfare of wild deer and, alongside other evidence, we have given careful consideration to the findings of the Scottish Animal Welfare Commission.\"He added ldquoAs Scotlandrsquos deer authority, NatureScot have a pivotal role to play in the implementation of these recommendations and will, alongside the Scottish Government, be engaging further with stakeholders on many of these key issues in the next parliamentary term.\"Robbie Kernahan, NatureScots Director of Sustainable Growth, said:ldquoDeer are an iconic species in Scotland, but also an important source of revenue for land managers.

It also details how these targets will be delivered over the letime of the National Islands Plan.The new route map has been created with input from island stakeholders and local authority partners. Its objectives have been informed by a COVID Lens Survey, conducted last year. The top three signicant strategic objectives identied were transport, sustainable economic development and digital connectivity.Launching the route map today, Scotland#s minister for energy, connectivity and the islands Paul Wheelhouse said: “This has been a challenging year for everyone, and our island communities in particular have been, and continue to be, impacted by COVID-.#I would like to take this opportunity to thank our island communities for their resilience in response to the pandemic and for their continued dedication to combating this virus.“The Implementation route map will be published as a ‘living’ document to enable it to respond to fresh challenges and changing circumstances as they arise. We will continue to work closely with key stakeholders to ensure that the voices of islanders are fully heard as we look to bring into reality the aspirations of those islanders who helped shape the National islands Plan and all the objectives within it.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was then that the first serious air-raid of World War II began, as The Orcadian reported on the following Thursday.#The thunder of the heavy anti-aircraft guns shook Kirkwall houses, rattled windows and domestic utensils. The blast in some cases blew open the wooden shutters of windows, the sashes of which had been opened to avoid being broken by the concussion. The ground quivered when bombs fell considerable distances off.#At least  German aircraft attacked Scapa Flow and HMS Sparrowhawk, the airfield on the outskirts of Kirkwall, but the worst effects of the raid were felt in Stenness. The German claim that airfields at Kirkwall and Stromness were attacked lends weight to the theory that the civilian airfield on the Stromness side of the Bridge of Waithe, used by Gandar Dower before the war, was mistaken for a military target.The eye-witness accounts published in The Orcadian and Orkney Herald, although clearly reworded by the journalists, gives a vivid picture of the evening when everyday surroundings became so terryingly strange.The Bridge of Waithe, which carries the Stromness-Kirkwall road over the sea entrance to the Stenness Loch, gave its name to the little cluster of buildings around the nearby junction with the Orphir Road. The building on the corner became famous after the war as Orkney’s night-club, the Golden Slipper, but in  it was Willie Farquhar’s cobbler’s shop. Like many cobbler’s shops in Orkney, it was a place where men would gather in the evening so Willie and his mother Ellen had begun to sell lemonade, cigarettes and sweets. A young family lived at the other end of the little row: James and Lily Isbister with their three-month old son Neil. Another young family, Alfie and Cathy Linklater with ten-month old Freddie, lived in the house just behind them, at right angles to the road. Isa McLeod was in the house on the other side of the road.The Orcadian interviewed Mrs Ellen Farquhar just a few days after the bombing . . .For the rest of this story, see the current edition of this week#s The Orcadian, or visit Patrica’s website, www.aboutorkneyPatricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social history. copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

GAC, a global shipping and logistics company, said the ship had experience a blackout without elaborating.Bernhard Schulte, however, denied the ship ever lost power. vw,vw,px, px\"Evergreen Marine Corp, a major Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship, said in a statement that the Ever Given had been overcome by strong winds as it entered the canal from the Red Sea but none of its containers had sunk.An Egyptian official similarly blamed a strong wind. Egyptian forecasters said high winds and a sandstorm plagued the area Tuesday, with winds gusting as much as  mph .A pilot from Egyptrsquos canal authority typically boards a ship to guide it through the waterway, though the shiprsquos captain retains ultimate authority over the vessel, said Ranjith Raja, a lead analyst at the data firm Refinitiv.An image posted to Instagram by a user on another waiting cargo ship appeared to show the Ever Given wedged across the canal as shown in satellite images and data.A backhoe appeared to be digging into the sand bank under its bow in an effort to free it. vw,vw,px, px\"A satellite image of the Ever Given stuck in the Suez Canal The Egyptian official said tugboats hoped to refloat the ship and that the operation would take at least two days. The ship ran aground some . milesnorth of the southernly mouth of the canal near the city of Suez, an area of the canal that is a single lane.The incident could have a major knock-on effect for global shipping moving between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, warned Salvatore R Mercogliano, a former merchant mariner and associate professor of history at North Carolinarsquos Campbell University.ldquoEvery day,  vessels on average go through that canal, so the closing of the canal means no vessels are transiting north and south, Mr Mercogliano told the AP.ldquoEvery day the canal is closed hellip container ships and tankers are not delivering food, fuel and manufactured goods to Europe and goods are not being exported from Europe to the Far East.Already, some  vessels waited at Egyptrsquos Great Bitter Lake midway on the canal, while some  idled in the Mediterranean near Port Said and another  at Suez in the Red Sea, according to canal service provider Leth Agencies.That included seven vessels carrying some five million barrels of crude oil, Refinitiv said. vw,vw,px, px\"Canal chiefs assess the situation The Ever Given, built in  with aof nearly  meters and a width of  meters , is among the largest cargo ships in the world.It can carry some , containers at a time. It previously had been at ports in China before heading toward Rotterdam in the Netherlands.Opened in , the Suez Canal provides a crucial link for oil, natural gas and cargo. It also remains one of Egyptrsquos top foreign currency earners.In , the government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi completed a major expansion of the canal, allowing it to accommodate the worldrsquos largest vessels. However, the Ever Given ran aground south of that new portion of the canal.copy -. This site is part of Newsquests audited local newspaper network. A Gannett Company.

It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests. The trouble is: there is precious little evidence of that calibre of inidual in Scotland’s political landscape of today.IT SEEMS like only yesterday I was talking about preparing for the winter and here we are with spring on the horizon.

Not a disaster by any means, particularly in this part of the world, but my own lowest tally ever, as usually I’m looking at somewhere around the  to  per cent mark.I suspect an underlying issue with fluke at tupping time. Fasciola hepaticais a tiny mud snail which is ingested through grazing and attacks the liver. It thrives in wet conditions and is re in Scotland.There are routine treatments, but it’s now recognised that the parasite is developing a resistance to some of the products on the market. As a result of that, the advice is to constantly use dferent ones and I probably wasn’t as meticulous in this as I should have been, although I know that others too have had increased problems with fluke in the early part of the winter – and it was horrendously wet in November through to December.So the dry, hard frost of a couple of weeks ago was a godsend and it was on such a bracing but beautul morning that we gathered for the scanning, the ground underfoot like uneven concrete. You could have gotten away with your trainers.Once the work was completeI linked up my iPhone with the scanner and a detailed breakdown of the results popped up on the screen. A couple of pings later and it was out in the ether, all the way out to the North Sea where it was downloaded by someone not able to be in attendance to view his own results almost instantaneously.It was a lovely symbiosis of tradition and technology, though goodness knows what the bodachs of yesteryear would have made of it all."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/John_Purser-202030713-edited.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais pure escapism among the fenian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThat may explain why story-telling and mythology were so highly prized.

The stories were commissioned by BBC Radio  and combine Jans dark sense of humour and social observation.They’ve been described as charming, eye-opening and sometimes painfully sad as we see each tenant of the caravan park struggle with their own private dramas. The Last Resort observes the dynamics and ersity of the Ireland we live in today, with Jan exploring complex family dynamics, ageing, immigration, gender politics, the decline of the Church and the legacy of the Troubles throughout the stories. Jan wrote short stories on the back of postcards for one of her last short story collections. During the pandemic, she began this practice again, and sent stories to isolated members of the community. Through this, she has struck up a friendship with an elderly man, living and isolating alone in Belfast. These stories eventually became The Last Resort, making him the first reader. Jan says: “The ten part short story series, The Last Resort, ran fon BBC Radio . “I’m probably more proud of this wee series than anything I’ve turned my hand to before.

When the final recordings came back, I was absolutely blown away by how the programmes had turned out. “It’s a really humbling experience to sit back and listen to ten strangers take your ideas to a place where they seem richer, realer and a hell of a lot funnier, than they were inside your head. I think the actors made something truly remarkable out of these stories, and I want to make sure they get due credit for their creativity. “These are all brilliant, talented and lovely to work with people. Please send lots of work their direction.“Whilst it’s absolutely run of the mill, to watch or listen to UK-wide BBC programmes where every accent is an English accent, it is almost unheard of, to encounter a series which solely showcases Northern Irish talent. I’m particularly delighted to have brought a couple of pure Ballymena accents to the production.”Jan Carson is a writer and community arts facilitator based in East Belfast.

Phase , after the Easter break, will expand the programme to include all staff in primary schoolsThe third phase will add nursery, pre-school and, at least initially, pre-school education providers participating in the Pre-School Education Programme.Department of Education advice said that the LFD test was not “% perfect but the speed and convenience of LFD tests means they are very successful in identying asymptomatic iniduals”.“A small proportion of people may receive a  positive result but in NI anyone testing positive must immediately book a PCR test to confirm the result.“It is also possible to get a  negativean inidual is in the early stages of infection,” the Department said.“This is why everyone will be tested regularly so that no cases will be missed.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ebe .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"A lateral flow immunoassay diagnostic device  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueA lateral flow immunoassay diagnostic device The LFD programme aims for two tests to be carried out before Easter, and one prior toto school as an additional mitigation to reduce asymptomatic cases in school.Iniduals who receive a positive result from an LFD test will have to isolate along with members of their households from the time of their positive LFD result.A confirmation PCR test will be required for everyone who tests positive on LFD.If the PCR test result is negative, the inidual and their household can leave isolation and no further action is required.If the PCR test result is positive the inidual and their household and all other close contacts must complete a full ten days of self-isolation.Is it compulsory No. Consent forms will have to be signed and initially that is where the responsibility of teachers ends. Whether pupils take the test is left up to inidual families.Pupils in Years - and staff in post primary schools will be offered the tests twice weekly from next week, and teaching union the NASUWT said that schools “have not been given the time necessary to ensure the delivery of a competent testing system that will be robust and effective”.After the Easter holidays, all staff in primary and pre-schools will also be offered regular testing and the Department of Education plans to make the tests available for all pupils “at a later date”.The Lateral Flow Devicetests, which give a result in  minutes, will be offered to the oldest pupils and staff in post primary schools.Read MoreNI special schools to receive rapid Covid testingNI schools plan another failure by #ineffectual# Education Minister, claims teachers# unionUnions say that no guidance has been issued and training will consist of a webinar for principalsfollowed up by a series of frequently asked questions.School leaders have now been told they will have to issue consent forms and record who has received kits, but tests will not be taken in school.“Once pupils have received kits you should arrange a demonstration for them of how to use the kit the first time,” a document issued by the PHA and the Education Authority said on Thursday night.“The pupils then take their kit home to conduct their first test.”Schools were only notied last Monday, March , that they would organise testing for staff and pupils in Years - from theirto school on Monday March .What are the teaching unions saying about it The last minute rushing through of the testing procedure has angered teaching unions.“The Department of Education must work with unions and schools on a sensible timescale for the roll out of testing which is backed with the necessary practical and financial support,” said NASUWT General Secretary Dr Patrick Roach.“We all want pupils and school staff to be as safe as possible in school but an unplanned, uncoordinated and unworkable approach to mass testing without the provision of adequate resources and additional trained personnel risks undermining, rather than enhancing Covid safety.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dd--bcbc-eefffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dd--bcbc-eefffb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dd--bcbc-eefffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dd--bcbc-eefffb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Nasuwt’s Dr Patrick Roach. PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNasuwt’s Dr Patrick Roach. The Union’s Northern Secretary, Justin McCamphill, said it was “shocking” that the Department of Education are expecting school staff to supervise the administration of these tests with almost no notice.“Neither the Department nor the Education Authority can explainrisk assessments have been carried out while it is evident that little or no consideration has been given to the workload of school leaders,” he said.“In the absence of adequate guidance, proper consultation with unions or evidence of adherence to Health and Safety Regulations no teacher or school leader should either demonstrate the safe use of these tests or supervise pupils while they take the test.“Unless a teacher has a specic contractual term to the contrary, schools must not expect teachers to carry out or supervise the tests. Teachers and principals in grant aided schools in Northern cannot be instructed to undertake medical procedures.”What role will the teachers take in the programme now Teachers will not now carry out the tests, but there has to be a supervisory role. What happens when the tests are introduced at a later date for the youngest pupils, as the authorities have indicated, might be a dferent matter.The Association of School and College Leadersin Northern Ireland said teachers had no idea the testing programme would be rolled out before the announcement and had not been consulted about what would be expected.“Teachers do not want to see ato a revolving door of schools opening and then having to close again,” said Robert Wilson, Regional Officer.“The announcement that all pupils in Years  to  will face lateral flow tests on theirto the classroom has come as a total surprise to school leaders and comes on the back of a pilot scheme, the success of which they know very little about.“Schools have not been consulted about testing and communication on this matter from the Education Minister has been woefully poor and extremely short on detail. Teachers have been given precious little time to make arrangements for a major logistical operation they had not been previously warned about and have no experience of organising.“Unlike schools in England, which were given weeks to prepare for testing, their counterparts in Northern Ireland now have days to learn how to become medical professionals and act as an authority to their pupils on how to use lateral flow tests,” he added.“Testing may ultimately help our pupils to safelyto the classroom but we are concerned that rushing it may create more problems than it solves.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdb-cb--ab-aeb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern Ireland Education Minister Peter Weir PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNorthern Ireland Education Minister Peter Weir The Education Minister, Peter Weir, admitted he had read some reports concerning the effectiveness of the lateral-flow test and the possibility of “ positives”.“No test is completely accurate, but studies indicate a very high degree of effectiveness at detecting those who are infectious,” he said.“When infection levels are low in the community, a positive LFD test indicates that the inidual may have Covid,” he added.The Northern Ireland Teachers’ Councilsaid that while the organisation supports the further mitigation, there are concerns about ‘assisting’ students to take the test in a classroom school environment.“NITC remain keen to engage with the Department to discuss what support will be needed for the roll-out of lateral flow testing in schools to be successful – but in a way that does not compromise safety in school – or add to the already unacceptably high workload demands on school leaders,” NITC said.“Any member who comes under any unreasonable pressure with regard to any aspect of LFD testing is advised to contact their union immediately.”NITC added: “The Education Authority has indicated that additional resourcing to cover the administrative burden will be assuredrecorded under Covid costs.“The role of teachers is purely to facilitate familiarisation of the LFD test and the teaching unions advise that testing is safest carried out at home for privacy and to ensure no potential positive cases come into school.“School staff cannot be compelled to supervise or support pupils to conduct self-testing in schools,” they added.What has the Education Minister said Education Minister Peter Weir said the testing will provide a signicant level of reassurance to education settings.“All settings will be reminded of the need for stringent adherence to good practice and additional signage will be provided to all schools to encourage people to comply with public health messaging,” he said.“While it is for each family to decidethey wish for their child to participate in the testing, it will be of benefit to all those in schools for us to be able to break the chain of transmission of the virus by identying all those who may be asymptomatic.”Read MoreMark Bain:OpinionAs schools are set to , there’s a mixture of joy tinged with frustrationThe first batch of tests were scheduled to be delivered to post-primary schools this week, meaning all post-primaries will have enough tests to conduct at least one supervised test in school, and for pupils to be able to conduct a test at home before theyafter the Easter break.Jacquie White, General Secretary of the Ulster Teachers’ Union, said there are still too many unknown for teachers to be convinced of the long term sustainably of Covid-safe environments.“The Lateral Flow Testing is as yet an unknown and while the Minister admits it will be ‘challenging’ I think that is an understatement,” she added.“This is even before one considers the efficacy of the test which won’t detect asymptomatic carriers of Covid and is also known to give  positives.”Belfast Most ReadNotorious US killer Jacob Ind hopes for fresh start in NI with Belfast weSpecial day: John McAreavey celebrates his son#s christeningBelfast business fined after discovery of food contaminated with rodent faecesDeputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill tells of becoming a mother at age of Vaccination slots can now be booked at Belfast#s SSE ArenaTop VideosPlayHealth Minister warns of potential for third virus surgePlayVideo: #You#re absolutely right# -

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDenis KeenanLauren HarteTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailBelfast may be home to the Titanic, George Best and Sir Van Morrison, but when it comes to pinpointing the city on a map, many people are still stumped.A survey of , UK citizens by online training providers The Knowledge Academy found just over a thirdcould not point out where Belfast was.But it still fared better than cities in other parts of the UK.Newcastle topped the list of cities people cannot place on %, followed by Stoke-on-Trentand Sheffield .Brighton , Londonand Cardfwere among the cities people found easiest to point out on a map.The Belfasttook to the city centre to gauge the views of locals on the findings.Chris O’Hanlonsaid being unable to identy Belfast was completely ridiculous.You should know Belfast, whether it’s from the UK map being on the weather forecast every day or just from general common sense, he added.It’s disappointing and not much to ask that people know where one of the home cities is located. It’s basic geography.Kris Jonessaid: I’m kind of surprised that it’s only % because, having dealt with a lot of people from London in my work, I’ve often been asked questions about needing to get money changed to come over here, thinking that Northern Ireland is in the Euro area.I’ve certainly found people are a lot more relatable to Belfast in places like Liverpool, Newcastle and Scotland.Lots of people in Westminster don’t really care about Northern Ireland and what it stands for or who we are as part of the UK.I’m not overly surprised, but I’m still kind of disappointed.That was a view shared by Marian Cullen , who said: I’m not surprised because people in Britain don’t see beyond Britain. They think Ireland is all green, we all drink Guinness and we’re all called Paddy.If we’re travelling anywhere, we usually have to go through Britain first, so we know all the dferent parts, but English people don’t come to Belfast for their summer holidays.Laura Browneadded: It’s not good when we’re a capital city. I’m surprised that Belfast is not known around the UK since it’s such a popular city to visit and study in. It’s a bit sad, really.Harry Colemanfelt equally disheartened. I’m not in the least bit surprised to hear that because I don’t think most of them know there’s even a Northern Ireland and a Republic of Ireland, he said.People over there are ignorant of what happens here and that we’re even part of the UK, especially when it comes to our own currency.Denis Keenanadded: They haven’t a clue what’s going on here and they don’t care. I lived and worked in London during the Troubles, but English people were totally oblivious to what was happening here. We’re a small minority over here. We used to be a big part of the UK, but not anymore.Belfast Most ReadNotorious US killer Jacob Ind hopes for fresh start in NI with Belfast weSpecial day: John McAreavey celebrates his son#s christeningDeputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill tells of becoming a mother at age of Belfast business fined after discovery of food contaminated with rodent faeces#One thing I didn#t know about Northern Ireland was how much I would love living here#: BBC#s Emma VardyTop VideosPlayHealth Minister warns of potential for third virus surgePlayVideo: #You#re absolutely right# - MP Sammy Wilson#s apparent response to #get the ethnics out# commentPlayFive arrested for drug offences as PCTF targets South East Antrim UDALatest Northern IrelandForeign holidays very much out this summer – SwannDerry Bishop postpones First Communions until September over concerns about partiesForeign travel should be ruled out this summer, says Robin SwannBusiness group calls for ‘urgent solutions’ to challenges on trade from GBAppeal bid to release classied  IRA file rejected, say lawyersLatest from Belfast Channel  releases first-look image for new comedy We Are Lady PartsLeo Varadkar does not believe he will face criminal charges over leaked documentForeign holidays very much out this summer – SwannDerry Bishop postpones First Communions until September over concerns about partiesPernille Harder helps Cha to first-leg victory against Wolfsburg,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s an Olympic sport now so I#m still waiting for the call...Emma is an accomplished, multi-instrument musician, a very strong swimmer and a dab hand at both football and rugby.In fact, virtually nothing about the -year-old Southampton native is quite what you would expect.Viewers see her serious side on TV - which is perhaps unsurprising given that most reports involve the effects of Covid- or Brexit.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEmma Vardy  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueEmma Vardy But it#s never long before the fun-loving Emma breaks through to the surface, both literally and figuratively.She worked as a surf instructor to pay the bills when striving to make her way as a freelance reporter.In those early days at Sky she was making tea, printing scripts and running around rather than filming pieces to camera.But then the indefatigable Emma took a Masters degree in journalism at Falmouth University in surfing hotspot Cornwall.I was working as a surf instructor when I started getting freelance shts with BBC Radio Cornwall, she said.Quite often I would be coaching surf lessons in the morning and then going to a reporting sht... with salt and sand still in my hair.Ultimately TV work and current affairs took precedence - which is rather ironic considering her upbringing.I actually grew up without a television in the house so I didn#t watch a lot of news in the s, she revealed.My parents didn#t believe in having a TV, and I actually think that that helped me become very creative.The flip side was that I hadn#t a clue what was going on in popular culture, couldn#t connect with anything that the other kids were chatting about at school.In the end, however, it helped me develop my own mind, my own curiosity about things.The gted pianist remembers her dad bringing home a video camera that you had to record onto cassette tape when I was a kid and she started making little comedy reports in the back garden.I think it started there, she said. I didn#t know I was going to be a journalist but there was something in me that loved telling a story to camera.The former BBC South Home Affairs Correspondent and Daily Politics Programme regular was working as a political journalist in Westminster when the Ireland job came up in .The Irish border got very little attention during the referendum campaign, and yet it became the biggest conundrum and basically brought down a government, she said.I wanted to explain why Brexit had potentially such big implications here.It was a time when people didn#t really understand Northern Ireland yet it was playing this central role in the biggest news story at the time that was consuming everything.It#s fair to suggest that, back then Emma#s mother Cary, who grew up in Australia and is now in her s, knew more about Northern Ireland than the new BBC Ireland correspondent.Mum remembers the Northern Ireland of the s, s and s I have to remind her that I#m not in the thick of that, said Emma.Nevertheless, she was wary of stepping on any toes or ruffling feathers when she came here.When I got the job I was totally clear that I was coming to Northern Ireland with a lot to learn, she said. I was very much an outsider in a place full of talented and brave local journalists.Also some of the BBC#s finest correspondents had done the Ireland job before me so I knew I had very big shoes to fill.She added: Mark Devenport [former BBCNI Political Editor] helped me a lot in understanding the layers of politics here and how to explain it. He was brilliant, as were many others.There was something  Emma wasn#t fully prepared for: how much she#d come to love living here.I suddenly realised that Northern Ireland was this incredibly well kept secret, she said.People back home in England seem to associate Northern Ireland with the dangerous place they used to see on the news but I discovered that it#s an incredible place to live.Just a few minutes outside of Belfast you could be on a mountain, you could be in the sea the north coast is endlessly dramatic and stunning. I absolutely love living here.It didn#t take long, however, for Emma to witness a dark side of her new habitat.Lyra McKee#s murder [on April , ] will always stay with me, she said.What happened that night was absolutely tragic, it shocked the world.It reminded people who#d forgotten that an undercurrent of violence still exists here. Lyra#s death and funeral weren#t the end of the story.I felt this huge sense of anger and disgust from the public that a teenager had been sent out into the streets with a gun. The statements put out by the dissidents afterwards trying to justy the violence sickened people.Asking them a few questions with a microphone just showed what cowards they are.Emma said she was always really incensed by things that seemed unfair and always wanted to question things that other people turned a blind eye to.I remember starting a petition at school when I was  because the boys were able to play football across the majority of the school playground but the girls weren#t, she said.I even held this protest by playing netball in the school#s no-balls area to try to take a stand.I think that was my first experience of politics, and the first sign that I wanted to question things...On April , she will celebrate two years with partner Aaron Adams , an analyst for Translink, with whom she lives in Belfast. The couple met while playing mixed five-a-side football.I actually used to be more of a rugby player but now I play football a lot, she said.Aaron and I didn#t really do conventional dates at first. We went to the gym together. Our second date was a kick-about at the park! In the five-a-sides he#d set me up to score goals so that probably clinched it. Our first #real# date was April Fool#s Day .Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEmma with her partner Aaron Adams and his late daughter Ellsa FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueEmma with her partner Aaron Adams and his late daughter EllsaAaron lost his daughter from a previous relationship, Ellsa Alexander Adams, on February . She was just six years old.Ellsa suffered from a rare condition called CDKL, which meant she had very complex needs and she suffered from lots of seizures. Another aspect of her condition was severe epilepsy.Ellsa had become a huge part of my le, said Emma.Aaron had been Ellsa#s full time carer for three years - hospital stays, seizures, there were endless challenges but Aaron was an incredible father and Ellsa battled all of that like the little superhero she was.She spent weekends with us. Aaron always told me that you had to treasure every minute with Ellsa and that#s what we did.We were never at home for long, whether it was swimming or ice skating or going to beaches or clf paths and on boats, Ellsa came with us and we were always taking her to the most beautul places.Even though she couldn#t move or communicate we just really wanted her to experience everything she could - the sounds of the beaches, the feel of us bumping her chair along clf tops, being on boats and the feeling of the wind. We did an awful lot with Ellsa in a short time.Despite Ellsa#s all-too-apparent condition, Emma and Aaron had no idea they were going to lose her so soon.It was a real shock when it happened, said Emma.Ellsa had battled so hard for so long, and in the end I think her little body couldn#t do it any more.Nothing can ever prepare you for that. I keep reminding Aaron what an amazing job he did as a father. I think Ellsa brought us closer that#s one of the many good things she#s left behind.Losing Ellsa - who has an older brother Jonah , with whom the couple spend lots of time with and have a lot of fun with - prompted a huge show of sympathy from the Northern Ireland public.When Ellsa passed away thousands of people sent us messages, Emma recalled.Aaron did a lot of fundraising for her so she was quite widely known. When I was out with Ellsa in shops people used to stop us and sometimes it wasn#t because they recognised me, it was because they recognised her.It is impossible to describe the pain that Aaron#s feeling but all that love and kindness from so many people in Northern Ireland just meant such a lot.I wasn#t expecting that many people to reach out and when they did it didn#t make the pain any less but it did make a terrible time a little bit less dark.Emma regrets not having been home to see her family in England over the last year because of the pandemic.Father Ron, a former professional musician is in his early s, and she has two brothers and a sister - Alastair , Davidand Joanne . Alastair, who is in pyrotechnics, worked on Game of Thrones, while her sister works with horses and David is in the IT industry.She would also like to see more of Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC#s high profile Political Editor.Laura has been a huge support to me behind the scenes, said Emma.

Dr Tom Black, BMA Northern Ireland council chair said, “I think we are all probably amazed that one year later we are still battling Covid-. It has certainly been a year of ups and downs with many families facing illness and the loss of a loved one from a disease that we only learnt about just over a year ago. “Doctors have been firmly on the frontline of Covid- either in direct patient care in ICUs, or in maintaining other services in hospitals as best as they could. Some have been central to research to better understand Covid- and some have helped develop a vaccine and roll that out as quickly as possible. Our GP surgeries quickly pivoted to provide online consultations as well as covid assessment centres. That meant we could continue to see patients in surgery when necessary without the risk of coming into contact with Covid-. googletag.cmd.push He added: “Doctors did all of this because they saw the huge crisis that was unfolding and they wanted to do their part in tackling it. Many are now exhausted and there is no doubt that many doctors need time now to rest both physically and emotionally and to come to terms with what they have been through. I am proud to see how much the profession worked together, old silos and barriers quickly came down and we saw a lot of innovation and flexibility. We have also seen that in the long term our health service needs more more resources and more staff so we can expand, address the backlog and be ready for the huge surge in need we are now facing. googletag.cmd.push “This year has taken a toll on everyone as we have adapted and changed our whole way of living and working. We are in a much better place than we were this time last year as we now know much more about Covid- and how to treat it, and the vaccination programme is a real beacon of hope for everyone. I would urge everyone to take a moment today to reflect on how far we have come over the past year, remember all those we have lost and to come together in the hope for a better year ahead.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Hyndmans of Maghera was founded in  and had served the community of County Derry and beyond since with its baked goods. In an understated sign-off, the company simply printed a short message of thanks to all its customers on its final batch of products. “Thank you for your loyalty over  years,” it read. As news of the closure began to break online, hundreds of people shared happy memories of the company and its impact on the area. “This is a sad day for Maghera and indeed the rest of the local area and further afield,” said photographer David A Scott, leading the tributes. googletag.cmd.push “To many they are a institution, one that we all grew up with and one that will be sadly missed, not only by the customers but by the employees and their families who relied on them for their livelihood.” Former customer Paula McCormack said it was a terrible loss to the area. The gates of Hyndmans were locked last Friday. “I hope their workers have been able to get jobs. Their bread was delicious, especially fruit cake and their sodas were the best in the country.” However, fans of the bakery have been buoyed by news that a number of the bakerys staff will be continuing to work in the area. googletag.cmd.push Former Hyndmans staff Geoff Lee, Nigel Chambers and Sandra McDonald have linked up with Berties Bakery in Magherafelt, who announced the news the same day Hyndmans ceased production. “Hyndmans was an institution in its own right and we were sorry to hear of their closing,” they said. “Bertie’s is however delighted that we have been able to help three of their staff into key roles within our business and perhaps in some way we will be able to keep what was best about Hyndmans alive. “Sandra will be helping us with our new cake and traybake ranges, while Geoff and Nigel bring a wealth of experience particularly in Soda Breads.”     Former Hyndmans customers will be happy to see their favourite soda bread recipe live on.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The scheme has been agreed in partnership with Derry City and Strabane District Council as part of the Covid recovery process. Measures include the introduction of a one-way system from Carlisle Road, through Ferryquay Gate into The Diamond. The existing parking area at the quadrant outside the former Austin’s department storewill be removed to create more public space. A priority system for traffic is to be introduced at Shipquay Gate which will allow a new footway to be created under this historic gate. googletag.cmd.push New spaces are also to be created on Bishop Street to facilitate outdoor trading opportunities for cafeacute-type businesses. Making the announcement, Infrastructure Minister Nicola Mallonsaid: “The Covid pandemic has brought many changes to how we conduct our daily lives and as we move towards a recovery phase I want to play my part in the transformation that our society deserves. This means creating a greener, cleaner more sustainable environment with less reliance on motor vehicles and a renewed focus on those who wish to walk, wheel and cycle. Once completed these measures will transform the Derry cityscape, providing safe spaces for all who work and live there to meet, shop and travel. googletag.cmd.push “I am also committed to working with other local councils, stakeholders and local people so that we can shape our future together and deliver similar changes across our villages, towns and cities.” Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Brian Tierney, welcomed the introduction of the new measures saying he hoped they would facilitate the reopening of businesses once restrictions were lted and help encourage the public back into the city centre to socialise and shop in a safe environment. “These temporary interventions willredesignthis important urban space and create a more attractive and accessible town centre that will help restore customer confidence and drive footfall so we can rebuild our business, retail, tourism and hospitality sectors as they prepare to reopen.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

been dumped into local rivers, ended up on farmersrsquo land which was flooded by the swollen waterways.Farmers in Drumaness area raised their concerns with Mr Toman at the time because none of the statutory agencies were prepared to help them.Mr Toman said as a result of the extreme wet weather before Christmas, the Drumaness river overflowed on to land owned by a number of local farmers.He

Council confirmed at a meeting last night that there were  reported fly-tipping incidents last year, compared to  in .Between  and  over , fly tipping incidents were reported to the local authority while, incredibly, during the first two months of this year, council officials have already received reports of  fly-tipping incidents across the district.During the height of the coronavirus pandemic between March and December last year, there were  illegal dumping incidents, compared to  over the same period in .The figures made public at last nightrsquos meeting of the councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee revealed that the average number of fly tipping incidents across the district rose from  each week to  for a period last year, before dipping back to .News of the scale of the fly-tipping issue comes after a large consignment of tyres was dumped illegally last week outside Killyleagh.Around  tyres were found dumped at the Scaddy Road and Greystown Road, while, there was more fly-tipping at an illegal dumping hot spot at Ardilea, near Clough, where an old washing machine and other household debris was dumped.In a bid to call time on the illegal dumpers, the local council has employed additional enforcement officers and drawn up a new plan to deal with fly-tipping and dog fouling issues.In addition, two more seasonal enforcement staff are to be appointed next week as the local authority braces itself for a busy spring and summer.Council officials have also confirmed that they are exploring the possibility of using mobile CCTV to catch those who fly-tip which could include enforcement staff wearing body-cams as part of an evidence gathering initiative.In the summer, a new awareness programme to highlight fly-tipping and dog fouling issues across the district will be rolled out by the local authority, while consideration is being given to introducing a new community fund to support anti-littering and dog fouling initiatives across the district.During the last financial year the local authority issued  fixed penalty notices to litter louts, with  of the offenders paying up. Eight fixed penalty notices for dog fouling were issued over the same period.Rowallane area councillor Billy Walker, who was alerted to the dumped tyres outside Killyleagh, said there were people who viewed secluded rural areas as open air dumping grounds.ldquoThis behaviour must stop, he declared. ldquoThe tyres dumped outside Killyleagh had been left in three dferent areas and I hope that whoever was responsible for this illegal dumping incident will be caught and that the courts will impose a penalty which sends out a clear signal that this behaviour will not be tolerated and has no place in any civilised society.ldquoCouncil officers visited the Scaddy and Gregstown roads looking for evidence and the issue has also been reported to the Environment Agency. Incidents of this nature are happening all too often across the district.Cllr Walker says there have been recent reports of tyres dumped where in the Rowallane area including Ballynahinch and Saintfield.ldquoThe number of fly-tipping incidents reported across the district makes uncomfortable reading and the ironic thing is that those responsible for dumping waste end up paying for its removal through the rates and taxes, he said.ldquoIt is clear that a van or lorry was used to dump the tyres in Killyleagh and I would appeal to anyone who knows anything about this incident to contact the council or the police. This behaviour must not be allowed to continue.Cllr Walker said while local authority officials are doing their best to get on top of the fly-tipping issue, their efforts are being hindered by some in the community who have no respect for their own areas and communities.He added: ldquoFly-tipping and dog fouling issues are a scourge on our district and while additional enforcement officers have been recruited, the battle to address illegal dumping starts with those who engage in such behaviour.

Just like yesterday the place was deserted.Jimmyrsquos K has been in the calendar since  and has taken place every year since with only two hitches ndash foot and mouth in  and an lsquoout of the bluersquo snow day in  caused postponement, but only by a short space of time.The pandemic that struck in  totally overshadowed these minor interruptions.Covid- had been appearing in the headlines for a few weeks by then, but initially it seemed to be a remote problem confined to China and other places overseas, yet suddenly it was on our doorstep and a very real threat.The powers that be were issuing bulletins to inform us all of what restrictions might be imposed and yet it still seemed asthe race would go ahead as there was no direct order to cease.The race committee met daily and then had almost hourly gatherings as the situation closed in.When schools and work places were told to prepare for closure and the government was using the word lockdown, it was decided that it was best to communicate to all that the race would not take place.After doing all the hard work, it was a bitter pill to swallow but taken in the context of what some had to face in their lives, it was just a fact of le and a line was drawn. We all hunkered down and waited for the storm to pass.Little did we know then that a year later that we would still be under orders to socially distance, to work from homepossible and to avoid unnecessary journeys, etc.We would have found it hard to envisage how work and home le would be impacted and that sport would be universally curtailed.Initially we had rolled over all the entries from the  race to the corresponding date in , but in December it was obvious that a race in March would not be feasible.We took a decision to push the date back in the hope that a race in  would still happen. At that time, we chose June  as the new date, but the recent lsquoRoadmap to Recoveryrsquo has caused a rethink.The good news is that with the uptake of the vaccine and the fall in numbers regarding infection rates and hospital cases, things are moving in the right direction, but by stalling for a couple more weeks, we feel that there will be further easing of limits.We are awaiting the next Executive update in the hope that club training might be able to take place in the not too distant future and that competition will follow. So we have rebooked a date for Jimmyrsquos  mdash Sunday, June .All  entrants have been carried over and East Down AC greatly appreciate the understanding of the runners and other clubs.We know that it is not ideal that changes are made and we all prefer certainty and being able to train for a set goal, but we are trying to make the best out of a dficult situation.Racing has been thin on the ground in the last  months so organisers and athletes are equally keen to get back in action. might seem distant now, but the photos in the archives remind us of the good times.That year was a bumper entry and the race was a huge success. We have to hold on to those memories for now and tell ourselves that we will enjoy it all the more for the long wait.The club is very excited at the prospect of hosting old friends and new and it will be a happy day for all concerned.Once all the deferrals are accounted for, It is hoped that extra places will also go on sale.These will be advertised in the Down Recorder, as well as at www.eastdownac and on the EDAC Facebook page, so keep an eye out..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17Mar2021-Peace.jpg","title":"Peace maze among top worldwide attractions  ","story":"THERE will be no surprise locally that the stunning peace maze in the sweeping grounds of Castlewellan Forest Park has been included in a prestigious list of post-lockdown international attractions.Previously listed among ldquoonce famous world attractions, the maze commands stunning views towards the majestic Mourne Mountains sweeping down to the Irish Sea.Travel website Loveholidays has been looking into Guinness World Record books to discover previous record-holding places to visit.The site, which lists eight attractions across Europe, Asia and North America, features Castlewellan Forest Park, where the maze is considered to have one of the most outstanding tree and shrub collections in Europe.And it is in good company in the list, joined by the CN Tower in Toronto and the Stade de France in Paris among others.

In the first episode Terry Boyle, a character with Down’s Syndrome, played by Tommy Jessop is interviewed as a suspect. Later Supt Ted Hastings, played by NI actor Adrian Dunbar, refers to him as ‘the local oddball’.After last night’s show Mr Gamble, who runs an organisation focused on safeguarding children online, tweeted: “Especially on the day that it is but also on any day, the script writer of #LineOfDuty needs to reflect on the line referring to a suspect with special needs being referred to as the local odd ball.”Mr Mercurio defended the use of the term oddball saying it “has no connotation for learning dficulties”. He said: “It describes a loner, an eccentric. The drama is using the term to refer to the Dando case, not to learning dficulties.”Read More Read MoreLine of Duty cast and crew reveal behind the scenes secretsMr Gamble suggested that Mr Mercurio “speak to some people who’ve worked in policing and with vulnerable people and see what they think about connotation in this context”.Mr Mercurio said Line of Duty worked with numerous police advisers and the programme portrayed “policing with some of its failings.”Mr Gamble said the use of the term “was foolish to say the least and shows an utter lack of understanding”. He said: “If you’re saying the head of professional standards would say that you need new police advisors.”Mr Mercurio said: “OK, Jim, you keep up your rose-tinted view of policing. The events of the last week was clearly just a mass delusion.”Many on social media supported Mr Gamble’s assertion that the line was inappropriate while some said TV drama needed to reflect what people might say.NI actor Charlie Lawson said that “writing must be totally real and no rules applied”.He said: “I think that’s exactly what the character would say. Good writing shouldn’t offend in context.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Boris Johnson advised public buildings, including theatres, to close and mass gatherings to stop.This week,  months on, campaign group We Make Events Cymru, reflects on the impact of Covid- and how the lockdown restrictions has had a devastating effect on their industry.The impact of the announcement back in March last year meant that the UK event sector came to an outright standstill, resulting in events being cancelled, theatre and music shows could not be staged and thousands of Welsh event professionals could not work.We Make Events Cymru, , has spent the last  months lobbying the Welsh Government to highlight the need for continued sector support in order for the events organisers, iniduals and supply chain to survive Covid- restrictions.After a year of campaigning, We Make Events Cymru continues to push for opportunities to re-open the sector in light of the Welsh Government Coronavirus Control Plan , which does not allow gatherings of more than  people in Tier .As a result of many conversations with the Welsh Government, We Make Events Cymru has created a survey to gather the much needed data to evidence the number of people involved in the sector and the contribution they make to Wales and its economy.Stephen Burkitt-Harrington, Director of Production  one of Walesrsquo leading Creative Events Companies, said: ldquoThe Welsh Government has been saying all along that it could not reopen events of any kind without industry specic data. We were surprised to learn that they were not collecting this information though.\"This is why we have put together the biggest survey of our industry ever undertaken in Wales. Companies big and small, venues, events, and every inidual involved in even the smallest way can contribute now.\"By giving us as little or as much as people are prepared to contribute, we can then provide the government with the much talked about data they say they need to see how valuable our wide ranging industry is to the Welsh economy, and how important it is to get it open again as soon as it is safe to.Alongside the survey, the group have also recently launched their own website which gives sector colleagues access to wellbeing and financial advice, access to a database of Welsh event organisers, suppliers and iniduals, as well as a forum to chat and exchange ideas ndash resources that the team believe is vitally important during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:We Make Events Cymru is in regular dialogue with Welsh Government to lobby, and is part of the working party preparing for Covid-safe outdoor and indoor test events. These test events are an integral stepping-stone to get the industry in Wales back working again .Sarah Hemsley-Cole, Director of Cardf based SC Productions and the Lead Coordinator for the campaign said: ldquoWhilst we have to accept large mass gatherings are not possible in  ndash it is essential that we keep up the pressure on Welsh Government to allow covid safe cultural activities in the Summer of .\"We are a creative and innovative sector, and by working with Welsh Government to develop appropriate guidance and to generate factual data and evidence from the test events, we can get performers, artists, technicians and the eco system back to work and audiences back to what they love.Working alongside partners such as Equity, Creu Cymru, BECTU, Cardf Music Board, Cult Cymru, Freelancers Make Theatre Work Freelances Task Force, What About Weddings and The Musicians Union ndash We Make Events Cymru has helped give the industry and events people a crucial voice during these unprecedented times.Following on from the recent budget announcement, We Make Events Cymru acknowledge the essential package of support already received from the UK and Welsh governments, and is pleased to hear of the further support expected with the extension of furlough, additional SEISS grants ndash which now includes newcomers to the industry who started their businesses in the   tax year, as well as the Cultural Recovery Fund.We Make Events Cymru are now waiting to hear about additional financial aid and get a better understanding of how long this relief money is expected to last business and iniduals in Wales. There are still thousands across the country who have been excluded from any kind of financial support ndash these people need to be recognised and also offered funding.The campaign group is also calling for the events industry to be considered on a par with other industries like hospitality and the Film and TV sector for things such as insurance and financial schemes.The UK is internationally recognised for delivering impressive cultural events. Within it, Wales plays a signicant role with its tremendous highly skilled workforce, many of whom have now had to ersy to work in other jobs.The impact of the lockdown will be felt within the Welsh events industry for many years to come. Rhys Maule, Managing Director of ProLX Productions in Cwmbran said: ldquoThe loss of extremely talented, hard working and dedicated professionals is really hard to see.\"These people are being backed into a corner as a result of no support and canrsquot see any way out other than to change career and move onto something more secure. Lots of these people feel they may neveras the risk is too great, which is devastating, and the impact on their metal health as a result of this is hard to hear.He added ldquoThe huge number of people falling through the gaps not receiving funding is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency to ensure the future of our industry.The COVID- pandemic has caused many events around Wales and the UK to be cancelled or postponed due the government-imposed restrictions on large gatherings. Among the most prominent events to be affected in Wales in  have been the National Eisteddfod, the Royal Welsh Show, Hay Festival, Abergavenny Food Festival, Cardf Half Marathon, Llangollen International Eisteddfod, Green Man and Ironman.

Wales Millennium Centre, Motorpoint Arena Cardf, Pontio,Venue Cymru and Aberystwyth Arts Centre were just some of the venues that lent their support to the campaign.We Make Events Cymru is calling on anyone who contributes to events in Wales and its eco-system to complete the survey in order to evidence the valuable contribution the sector makes in Wales.For more information about the survey, visit: https:www.wemakeevents.cymru . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

GAC, a global shipping and logistics company, said the ship had experience a blackout without elaborating.Bernhard Schulte, however, denied the ship ever lost power. vw,vw,px, px\"Evergreen Marine Corp, a major Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship, said in a statement that the Ever Given had been overcome by strong winds as it entered the canal from the Red Sea but none of its containers had sunk.An Egyptian official similarly blamed a strong wind.

A pilot from Egyptrsquos canal authority typically boards a ship to guide it through the waterway, though the shiprsquos captain retains ultimate authority over the vessel, said Ranjith Raja, a lead analyst at the data firm Refinitiv.An image posted to Instagram by a user on another waiting cargo ship appeared to show the Ever Given wedged across the canal as shown in satellite images and data.A backhoe appeared to be digging into the sand bank under its bow in an effort to free it. vw,vw,px, px\"A satellite image of the Ever Given stuck in the Suez Canal The Egyptian official said tugboats hoped to refloat the ship and that the operation would take at least two days. The ship ran aground some . milesnorth of the southernly mouth of the canal near the city of Suez, an area of the canal that is a single lane.The incident could have a major knock-on effect for global shipping moving between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, warned Salvatore R Mercogliano, a former merchant mariner and associate professor of history at North Carolinarsquos Campbell University.ldquoEvery day,  vessels on average go through that canal, so the closing of the canal means no vessels are transiting north and south, Mr Mercogliano told the AP.ldquoEvery day the canal is closed hellip container ships and tankers are not delivering food, fuel and manufactured goods to Europe and goods are not being exported from Europe to the Far East.Already, some  vessels waited at Egyptrsquos Great Bitter Lake midway on the canal, while some  idled in the Mediterranean near Port Said and another  at Suez in the Red Sea, according to canal service provider Leth Agencies.That included seven vessels carrying some five million barrels of crude oil, Refinitiv said. vw,vw,px, px\"Canal chiefs assess the situation The Ever Given, built in  with aof nearly  meters and a width of  meters , is among the largest cargo ships in the world.It can carry some , containers at a time.

Photo courtesy of Google.She said: “I was in town on Saturday and there was a wedding at the church and the clock was an hour slow.“I am sure it confused the bridal party.”Cllr Tinsley said when she discovered the historic clock needed repairs, she immediately raised it with Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council.She revealed that ABC Council has responsibility for around six clocks in the town.“It will need accessing to seeit needs parts so hopefully they can do that this week,” said the DUP councillor.She has asked that it be reset to  o’clock and help avoid confusion.St. Mark’s Church was built in . The site on which it now stands, was given by Viscount Mandeville, later, The Duke Of Manchester. The church was enlarged in  and again in , it was practically rebuilt, with a seating capacity for , people. The Nave and the Tower were left unfinished. In , what was left of the old Tower, was demolished. A new taller Tower was built as a Memorial to all who lost their lives in the - war. In , the Nave was extended and a Carillon of  bells were presented by ious donors. The bells are still played regularly by a few Capanologists and also provide the chimes on the hour, and every quarter of an hour, for the -faced clock which was given by the Portadown Urban Council after the new Tower was built.Vaccine jabs to be available in community pharmacies Read full story hereEditor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.

However, she is constrained by the level of funding available and continues to stress to Executive colleagues the need for investment in roads infrastructure to help address regional imbalance, help communities and improve safety.”The spokesperson said the Minister has bid for further funding for the - financial year and once confirmed, a list of roads set for repair in the next financial year will be made public.“The Minister has bid for £m for capital structural maintenance as part of the -  budget process,” said the spokesperson.“However, it is recognised that, while there is a negative correlation between funding and numbers of claims, evenbudgets were signicantly increased it is not possible to eliminate emergence of potholes and consequential submission of claims.“A provisional list of schemes in County Armagh is being developed across all programmes for delivery during the - financial year.“However, these programmes cannot be finalised until the Department’s - budget allocations are confirmed.“Once finalised, programmes will be included in the spring council reports which will, in due course, be presented to Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council before being made publiclyavailable online.”Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Stormont to councils in Northern Ireland, has been backed by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council.By The NewsroomWednesday, th March , : am  \"       \"  The motion was broughtto March’s meeting of Council by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by Councillor Eoin Tennyson.The motion read: “In recognition of the consultation on Programme for Government, InvestmentStrategy and Budget, lobbying by NILGA and other stakeholders, we call on Council to write to The Executive Office and the Department for Communities for the transfer of full regeneration powers and associated resources to local authorities as a matter of priority.”Following an amendment proposed by Councillor Liam Mackle and seconded by Councillor Paul Duffy it receivedthe unanimous support of the chamber.\"Craigavon Civic CentreIntroducing the motion, Cllr Pope said it was vital Council has the necessarypowers and funding to support the rebuilding of the local economy.“One of the key levers councils were promised to help them revitalise their boroughs is the power of regeneration,” he said.“Place shaping has become a critical part of the recovery process, especially in an environment where our places will be dferent and there is a real need for local solutions.“If Council had control over regeneration it could help plan for the longer term and consider all local towns, towns like Rathfriland, Markethill, Tandragee, Keady, Pontzypass and others could benefit.\"“There is also the issue that capital schemes are currently awarded on an annual basis and there are limitations on the ability to carry over funds at year end.If Council had control over these budgets it would be able to plan for the long term and potentially lead to better outcomes.”Seconding the motion, Cllr Tennyson said it would allow for a “holistic and joined up approach of our cities, towns and villages” and allow for the “local economy to be shaped by local voices”.Sinn Fein group leader, Councillor Liam Mackle said he was “generally supportive of the motion” but given the history of some “councils in the north” wanted safeguardsin place and proposed an amendment to the motion.The amendment reads: “…we call on Council to write to The Executive Office and the Department for Communities for the transfer of full regeneration powers and associated resources to local authorities as soon as an equality statement is agreed by all councils to ensure the principal of objective need is central to any future use of these powers or resources.”This amendment was seconded by his party colleague, Councillor Paul Duffy.DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said he was “fairly content” with the motion but asked for some time to consider Cllr Mackle’s amendment as he had one of his own.Cllr Pope then told the chamber he would accept the amendment as it “is really important this letter gets sent”.Ulster Unionist group leader, Alderman Jim Speers said he had “no particularproblem with the motion” and noted the he had brought a similar one to Council on January , .“It was not supported by everyone at the time but I always welcome people’s opportunity to change their minds,” said Alderman Speers.His party colleague, Sam Nicholson said from both a “personal and professional perspective” giving Council the ability to put a medium term regeneration plan in place is “needed now more than ever” but warnedthe power must not come without the necessaryfinance.Councillor Paul Berry said he fully supported the motion and agreedwith Councillor Nicholson “we need to be abundantly clear that when we call for this, we must ensure the finance is in place”.SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon also stressed the importance of the budget.“There is no point in powers comingthey don’t give us the adequate resources in terms of the personal that would come with it but also financial resources to allow us to do these works,” he said.Councillor Duffy askedCouncil would have the space to house extra staffthe powers were to be transferred and was assured by Council’s Chief Executive, Roger Wilson that once the detail is in place, Council would “work through that”.Cllr Baxter then confirmed that his amendment was “not dissimilar” to Cllr Mackle’s and said he was happy to support the motion.Thanking members for their support, Cllr Pope said he was of the belief Council had taken an “important decision that will resonate with other councils”.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
