It leads out onto one of the two courtyard gardens          The large kitchen is fitted out in a retro style, with pale green kitchen cabinets and a parquet floor. There are two tables that accommodate their large familiesMr Lazarus, an architect, said it took them almost five years to get past red tape after they purchased the plot before they were able to start building work in 2016.It then took another two years before their creation on the 12ft by 216ft plot was finally built, the Evening Standard reports.   Mr Lazurus, who paid £240,00 for the site, said: \u0027One of the challenges was to build something where the spaces felt well-proportioned.\u0027It felt like a lot of money to be handing over.

Reality TV shows like Love Island are \u0027dangerous\u0027 to children and could undermine #MeToo movementMrs Lunnon says young people might not be able to distinguish between what is real and what is fake.She said: \u0027The problem attached to that is what are the long-term consequences of a world where a) we are celebrating something essentially trivial, and b) we are focused, such relentless focus on appearance and the presentation of brand self - which we know is a spillover from social media itself.\u0027And Love Island\u0027s message, it seems to me, is conform and look beautiful otherwise you are not worthy of being loved.Kim Kardashian is the \u0027most dangerous\u0027 celebrity to search...Share this article \u0027Which is unbelievably dangerous.

Love Island was described as \u0027trivial\u0027 reality TV culture which obsesses over image by Mrs Lunnon\u0027So there is nothing wrong with a bit of light-hearted entertainment at all.\u0027Mrs Lunnon explained that one way to tackle the effect of reality TV and social media would be for schools to remind students they belong to a community.She added that in recent years she had witnessed pupils become increasing engaged in political debate, something she found promising.\u0027It is youthquake rather than snowflake, I think. I think we should stop telling kids that they are insignificant and fragile and vulnerable.\u0027The snowflake thing is not helpful.

Wade Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in most circumstances in the U.S.Kavanaugh had previously stated that the Roe v. Wade decision was ‘settled law’ in the country.The Maine Senator previously voted to confirm Kavanaugh after he was nominated by former President George W. Bush for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2006.Despite her previous confirmation vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Collins has faced intense pressure to vote against his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. A group of progressive activists has reportedly raised more than $1.75 million (£1.3m) in crowdfunding and vowed to release the funds to her future campaign opponents if she indeed votes in favor of Kavanaugh’s confirmation.Both the campaign funds and confirmation vote could have a key impact on Collins’s future Senate race, as polls reportedly showed that Maine voters were less likely to support Collins if she voted to confirm Kavanaugh – even before the sexual misconduct allegations against him surfaced.Senator Lisa Murkowski – Republican from AlaskaMurkowski, much like Collins, has become known as one of the leading moderate Republicans in the U.S. Senate.The 61-year-old Senator, who has been a member of the legislative chamber since 2002, has been known as an independent voice during her tenure, supporting abortion rights and, alongside Collins, helping to scuttle an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act signed by former President Barack Obama.Murkowski’s self-imposed test on the Kavanaugh confirmation vote comes, not from perilous reelection prospects – she’s not up for reelection until 2022 in a reliably Republican state – but whether women who allege that a sexual assault took place against them should be taken seriously.‘We are now in a place where it’s not about whether or not Judge Kavanaugh is qualified. It is about whether or not a woman who has been a victim at some point in her life is to be believed,’ she said.Murkowski, who soon joined fellow Republican Senator Jeff Flake in calling for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, does indeed have a political balancing act to do ahead of the confirmation vote.The Senator has long been supported by Native Alaskans, whose backing of her could falter after it was revealed by Hawaii Senator Mazie K. Hirono that Kavanaugh appeared to question whether Native Hawaiians were a legitimate protected group.          Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has a history of crossing party lines in the U.S. SenateSenator Jeff Flake – Republican from ArizonaFlake, 55, has long been a thorn in President Trump’s side. A vocal critic of the President who’s served in the U.S. Senate since 2013 and previously in the U.S. House of Representatives, Flake’s vote is seen as crucial.Unencumbered by political pressure – he’s opted not to run for reelection this year – Flake has expressed support for Kavanaugh’s conservative views but cautioned that the confirmation process needs the support of the whole country, something very difficult in the face of the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh and the polarized political climate that’s gripped the United States in recent years.‘I want to support him. I’m a conservative, he’s a conservative judge. But I want a process we can be proud of, and I think the country needs to be behind it,’ he said.Flake, who said that the testimonies of both Kavanaugh and Ford left him with ‘as much doubt as certainty,’ voted to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination but was also the first Republican Senator to call for an official FBI investigation to the allegations made against President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee.He’s made his views known that he intends to ultimately vote to confirm Kavanaugh unless the ongoing investigation turns up evidence the nominee lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee or engaged in unlawful sexual conduct.Though he has a long history of bucking Trump’s demands, Flake did indeed vote to confirm the President’s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.Senator Heidi Heitkamp – Democrat from North DakotaHeitkamp, 62, has served in the Senate since 2013 and is currently locked in a tight reelection battle in a state won easily by Trump.The North Dakota Senator, who previously voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, appeared to express at least some degree of support for Kavanaugh before the sexual misconduct allegations against him arose, even praising him as ‘highly-qualified’ for the position of Supreme Court Justice.However, the allegations against the nominee may have given Heitkamp pause.At a recent campaign stop in Grand Forks, North Dakota, she said that Kavanaugh’s nomination should not be something that’s ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ and also blasted her campaign opponent, U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer, for being critical of Ford’s allegations, denouncing the congressman as someone who has ‘a stunning lack of empathy for victims and the trauma they experience.’She’s also backed the ongoing FBI probe centered on the allegations made against Kavanaugh, saying: ‘We need to get politics out of this process and allow an independent law enforcement agency to do its job’  Heidi Heitkamp, left, is currently locked in a close reelection battle with Kevin Cramer, rightSenator Joe Manchin – Democrat from West VirginiaManchin, a 71-year-old conservative Democrat, is also facing reelection in a state overwhelmingly won by President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.Having first joined the Senate in 2010, Manchin voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2017 and has sided with Republicans on a number of issues.However, the West Virginia Senator has cited healthcare as a key deciding factor for him when it comes to Kavanaugh’s nomination, as he’s said that he’d like to see U.S. courts preserve the Affordable Care Act’s protections for Americans suffering with preexisting conditions.So far, Manchin has dropped few hints as to whether he’d vote to confirm Kavanaugh or not, but has stated that the judge had ‘all the right qualities’ after meeting with him earlier in 2018.Manchin has also backed the FBI investigation on the allegations made against Kavanaugh and has indicated he’d base his vote on the judge’s credentials if no evidence was found backing up the accusations made against Kavanaugh.‘If there’s nothing conclusive, then it’ll be based on the merits of him being qualified,’ he said. Fortnite season 6 searches on Pornhub doubled after launchThe 5 senators who will decide Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s fate revealedEuroMillions results: National lottery numbers for Tuesday, October 2Hocus Pocus 25th Anniversary Halloween Bash: All you need to know about Freeform\u0027s reunion specialColumbus Day 2018: When is it, how is it celebrated and is it a federal holiday?New on Netflix Australia in October 2018: All the new movies and TV shows revealedWorld Mental Health Day 2018: Everything you need to know What\u0027s on HBO in October 2018?

We are the solution that heals.\u0027Minutes later, he clarified: \u0027not abolish but. let\u0027s amend the 13th amendment We apply everyone\u0027s opinions to our platform.\u0027 But when a TMZ reporter who caught up with Kanye outside Mel\u0027s Diner in West Hollywood on Sunday  asked him to elaborate further, the singer admitted he had to study before he could answer.\u0027It\u0027s a political ad for the Dems\u0027: Trump lays into SNL...Share this articleIn a rambling interview, Kanye also touted a bizarre conspiracy theory that Abraham Lincoln may have been a black man.But when he was asked to explain which parts of the 13th Amendment he wished to amend, Kanye said: \u0027You know what?

When I speak, I have a feeling and I open up the conversation and I think we don\u0027t want to talk about… let me explain some of the things that I… that I wrote down on the plane.\u0027The principals that wrote the Constitution were Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Thomas Paine and John Adams – all white men. No women, no Jews, no black men. And we need to look at it. We need to examine it. One of the things about me tweeting about the First Amendment is the right to free speech.Alec Baldwin, who plays President trump on SNL, went after the rapper on Twitter one day after his comment. \u0027Dear Kanye, Your support of Trump is certainly your right. And the expression of any political ideas and support of candidates, so long as the violation of inidual rights is not involved, can only strengthen our system,\u0027 wrote Baldwin.\u0027But I believe that many people, perhaps most people in America, are either on to you or don’t care. U are a rich entertainer.

Word is that Kanye West, who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told \u0027no\u0027), was great. He\u0027s leading the charge!\u0027 An hour later, Trump randomly declared his confidence in winning the \u0027Black Vote\u0027 - despite the fact he only claimed eight percent of the black vote in 2016.  \u0027So if African-American unemployment is now at the lowest number in history, median income the highest, and you then add all of the other things I have done, how do Democrats, who have done NOTHING for African-Americans but TALK, win the Black Vote? And it will only get better!\u0027 he tweeted on Sunday.           West\u0027s tweets were met with dozens of responses as some fans asked him to explain his comments more directly and others slammed him for writing nonsense     The rapper said this week he had \u0027redesigned\u0027 the controversial hat and \u0027put positive energy into it\u0027. It is unclear why Kanye was wearing a Free Hoover shirt, but it appears to be related to Chicago gang leader Larry Hoover (right)Meanwhile, Kanye posted a selfie wearing the Make America Great Again cap while flying, adding: \u0027this represents good and America becoming whole again. \u0027We will no longer outsource to other countries. We build factories here in America and create jobs. \u0027We will provide jobs for all who are free from prisons as we abolish the 13th Amendment. Message sent with love.\u0027Many fans replied to his tweets with direct excerpts from the 13th Amendment, asking him to explain his musings more directly.The amendment reads: \u0027Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\u0027  One user @King_Yunn wrote: \u0027Saying abolish the amendment that also help (sic) abolish slavery without being specific on what you mean by abolishing it...is him purposely being indirect for drama?\u0027Another follower @AlishaFruits wrote: \u0027There\u0027s a hundred different ways he could\u0027ve said it without sounding like an uneducated fool and stirring up unnecessary controversy, but that\u0027s all he\u0027s got.\u0027  One of the sharpest rebukes came from actor Chris Evans, who tweeted: \u0027There\u0027s nothing more maddening than debating someone who doesn\u0027t know history, doesn\u0027t read books, and frames their myopia as virtue. \u0027The level of unapologetic conjecture I\u0027ve encountered lately isn\u0027t just frustrating, it\u0027s retrogressive, unprecedented and absolutely terrifying.\u0027Arguably the most prominent theory posed was that West\u0027s critique of the 13th Amendment is centered on a specific clause in the writing which says people who have been convicted of a crime can still be enslaved. One Twitter user behind this theory, @LBS4L, wrote: \u0027he\u0027s obviously referring to the \u0027as a punishment for crime\u0027 part. there is a reason why the US has the most prisoners total and per capita. it\u0027s because prison labor is akin to modern day slavery. he has talked about this in his music before (sic).\u0027 Such an explanation is supported by the fact that during his SNL performance  West wore a sweatshirt with the words \u0027FREE HOOVER\u0027 written across the front.The sweatshirt reportedly refers to jailed Chicago street gang leader Larry Hoover. Hoover founded the Chicago street gang the Gangster Disciples. He is currently serving six life sentences in Florence, Colorado. The sweatshirt is available for sale at $90 on Kanye\u0027s online store.     Donald Trump took aim at Saturday Night Live once again, after his embattled Supreme Court nominee was made the punching bag for the show\u0027s season premiere          An hour later, Trump seemed to feel confident that he would be able to garner the \u0027Black vote\u0027 It\u0027s not the first time West has shared controversial opinions about slavery. The rapper sparked outrage in May when he called slavery a \u0027choice\u0027 during an interview with TMZ. \u0027When you hear about slavery for 400 years — for 400 years? That sounds like a choice,\u0027 he said. \u0027You were there for 400 years and it\u0027s all of y\u0027all. It\u0027s like we\u0027re mentally imprisoned.\u0027It wasn\u0027t until months later that West finally apologized for the outburst during a radio appearance in late August.West told WGCI he never \u0027approached or addressed the slavery comment fully\u0027 because \u0027it\u0027s not something for me to overly intellectualize\u0027.He then apologized for how his tone and how his actions, including wearing the MAGA hat on several occasions, have affected his fans.            West has spoken in support of Trump on several occasions since he was elected to the Oval Office. The pair are pictured at Trump Tower in December 2016\u0027I\u0027m sorry for the one-two of the MAGA hat into the slavery comment. And I\u0027m sorry for people who felt let down by that moment,\u0027 he said.Fans praised what appeared to be a heartfelt apology, but were in for another let down when West unveiled his redesigned version of the red cap bearing Trump\u0027s 2016 campaign earlier this week. He told Fader that he had added \u0027positive energy\u0027 to the hat by flattening the brim and changing its shape slightly.   Kanye has stunned fans by becoming one of the few celebrities - as well as one of the only prominent African Americans - to support Trump.He went to visit Trump in 2016 shortly after the rapper disappeared to seek mental health treatment.His wife, reality television star Kim Kardashian, has gone twice to see Trump at the White House.Kanye recently promised that a new album, called \u0027Yahndi,\u0027 would come out on Saturday but no work immediately appeared.    Watch exclusive videos of Kanye West¿s visit to The FADER | The FADERKanye West Says His Slavery Comment Abolishing 13th Amendment is Work in Progress | TMZ.com"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/26/14/50A97E0D00000578-0-image-a-22_1537968940322.jpg","title":"Naomi Campbell lectures staffers outside New York Stock Exchange","story":"    The Vogue cover star looked as stylish as ever in black slimline pants, towering heels and a fashionable white trench coat, with large shades shielding her eyes  Campbell was seen gesturing emphatically with two members of her staff as she sashayed out of the New York Stock Exchange after ringing the closing bell last Monday           Campbell had just rung the closing bell with rapper French Montana (pictured together) on behalf of Global Citizen, an organization that aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030The eyewitness continued: \u0027I couldn\u0027t hear exactly what she was saying but there were a lot of hand gestures and she was speaking in an authoritative, demanding tone.\u0027She had a very severe expression but she did soften and give the blonde woman a hug and a kiss on both cheeks.

The plot of land was unwanted by architects and developers because of its size and shape          The first floor is where the family spends most of their time, in a large open-plan kitchen and living room. It leads out onto one of the two courtyard gardens          The large kitchen is fitted out in a retro style, with pale green kitchen cabinets and a parquet floor. There are two tables that accommodate their large familiesMr Lazarus, an architect, said it took them almost five years to get past red tape after they purchased the plot before they were able to start building work in 2016.It then took another two years before their creation on the 12ft by 216ft plot was finally built, the Evening Standard reports.   Mr Lazurus, who paid £240,00 for the site, said: \u0027One of the challenges was to build something where the spaces felt well-proportioned.\u0027It felt like a lot of money to be handing over. I remember thinking, Oh my God, what have I done?\u0027 The couple also wanted to \u0027give something to the street\u0027 so they made the bricks \u0027shine\u0027 with parts of the front of the property covered in mirror cladding. It makes the house glitter at night under street lights, and people often stop to take photographs.          A brightly lit hallway leads into the sizeable kitchen. The floor to ceiling glass doors maintain the sense of space felt throughout the property          The central staircase from the ground floor of the house. The property was built in two parts with the shell built first, which took a year and cost just over £300,000. By the start of last year they had a structure with a roof, windows, a staircase and wallsThe ground floor is overlaid with an anodised aluminium grid which is anti slip safety flooring used in factories.The property was built in two parts. The shell was built first, which took a year and cost just over £300,000. By the start of last year they had a structure with a roof, windows, a staircase and walls.They then spent another £200,000, hiring builders to finish installing the flooring, plastering the walls, plumbing and fitting the three bathrooms and kitchen. Just before Christmas Mr Lazurus and his family were able to move into the house.          In daylight the front of the house looks like a dark and textured tower thanks to the brickwork. It means at night the street lights make it glitter  The unusual design of the building makes it stand out from the rest of the street in Hackney, east London. Mr Lazurus says that at night time people often stop to take pictures as the building twinkles in street lights          The three bedroom property has a large open plan kitchen and living room and a mechanical ventilation and heat recovery system which sucks in fresh air from outdoors.

Kennedy\u0027s privileged childhood and teen years, growing up with his eight siblings in Massachusetts and New York, and vacationing at the family homes in Hyannis Port and Palm Beach, Florida as well as abroad. The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum recently made the Kennedy family photos available for viewing online after completing an 18-month project to catalog and digitize them.Born on May 29, 2017 in Brookline, an area outside of Boston in Massachusetts, Jack, as he was called by his family and friends, was named after his maternal grandfather, John Francis Fitzgerald, a former Congressman and mayor of Boston, who was known as ‘Honey Fitz’ for his charm and charisma. From a young age, the future 35th president would follow in his namesake\u0027s footsteps: Jack was considered a ‘natural wit’ to the point his mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy wrote down things that he would say, according to Nigel Hamilton’s ‘JFK: Reckless Youth.’Jack would parlay that charisma and wit all the way to the highest office in the land, and along the way attend elite preparatory schools where he would win friends and titles such as \u0027Most Likely to Succeed\u0027 but not always academic accolades despite an inidualist mind that enjoyed to read. Jack battled being seriously ill off and on throughout his childhood and teens years, but remained amiable and was considered the family\u0027s joker. All of the Kennedy kids contended with their parents - Rose and Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. - contentious marriage as Kennedy Sr. had several affairs, including with actress Gloria Swanson, according to the book.Rose Kennedy would have nine children – four boys and five girls – and began a ‘card-index filing system to keep track of the children’s medical histories and vital statistics’, and had a ‘daily inspection’ where she ‘looked for signs of fraying garments,’ according to the book. Jack, the second eldest after his older brother Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., ‘seemed unconcerned about dress,’ Hamilton wrote, and was at times disheveled with his shirt not tucked into his pants.          Born on May 29, 1917, John F. Kennedy was the second eldest child of the Kennedy clan.

Jack was close to death but recovered, and would face spells of sickness throughout his childhood and his teens, according to the book.Meanwhile, the family moved to a new home: a ‘colonial-style mansion with two-story, curving bay windows, a wraparound porch, fourteen rooms and a garage for the new Rolls-Royce’ in Brookline, according to the book.Rare Kennedy photos go inside America\u0027s most famous family...\u0027Childlike innocence\u0027 of JFK\u0027s eldest sister Rosemary is...EXCLUSIVE: How the bitter rivalry between sisters Jackie...Share this articleJack and his older brother, Joe, who was named after their father, were rivals, and ‘when not engaged in fisticuffs with his older brother, Jack turned more and more to books,’ according to the book. Hamilton surmises that while being ill, Jack took up the habit of reading. By aged six, Jack was promoted to second grade, and the next year to third grade when he was seven - ‘a year if not two ahead of most children his age,’ according to the book.Meanwhile his sister, Rosemary, who was a year younger than him, was a slow learner and was ‘unable to hold a knife and fork at first,’ according to the book, and Rose spent more time with her than Jack. By October 22, 1994, while Jack is in third grade at the Edward Devotion School, he pulled out of that institution and sent, along with his older brother, Joe, then nine, to the $400 a year Noble and Greenough Lower School. The Kennedy boys were likely the only Irish Catholic family at the school where most were Protestant and Anglo-Saxon, and as new boys they were the ‘object of derision and taunts,’ according to the book.           John F. Kennedy (left) stands with an unidentified boy holding a dog (right) outside the Kennedy family home in Brookline, Massachusetts, circa 1922. When Jack was two-years-old, he was struck by scarlet fever, and would face spells of sickness throughout his childhood and his teens, according to Nigel Hamilton’s ‘JFK: Reckless Youth\u0027          John F.

John F. Kennedy (center) has his arms around his sisters, Rosemary Kennedy (left) and Eunice Kennedy (right), outside the Kennedy family home  in Brookline, Massachusetts in May 1926          Newly available online Kennedy photos show the family vacationing often at the family homes in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts and Palm Beach, Florida as well as abroad. John F. Kennedy (center) is on skis on the snow-covered slopes in Poland Spring, Maine circa 1923They were driven to school by a chauffeur in a big black shiny car, and both Jack, with his ‘precocious intellect,’ and his older brother Joe liked the school despite all the ‘social and ethnic prejudice they suffered,’ Hamilton wrote. Joe and Jack were also ‘steadfastly loyal to the ex-mayor,’ their grandfather Honey Fitz, and would go campaigning with him.Among Boston’s upper crust, a contemporary of the Kennedy boys, Augustus Soule, said in Hamilton’s book that they ‘were very down on the Irish’ and that his father would have nothing to do with Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., who had made money ‘in ways that were known, in banking circles, to be unsavory.’Kennedy Sr. was a wealthy businessman who manipulated share prices, according to the book, and at one time owned production companies and tried his hand as a Hollywood impresario. It was during this period that Kennedy Sr., who was considered a womanizer, had an affair with icon and actress Gloria Swanson, according to the book.When Noble and Greenough Lower School faced calamity and was on the verge of closing, Kennedy Sr. stepped in with other families to financially save it, but not long after, in September 1927, the family moved to Riverdale, a wealthy residential neighborhood in the Bronx, and the Kennedy boys started class at the exclusive, nonsectarian Riverdale Country Day School, according to the book.The family would then move to a 12-bedroom colonial in nearby Bronxville in Westchester, and ‘at last acquired a summer house at Hyannis Port, on the east coast of Cape Cod,’ according to the book. The Kennedys would vacation often - in Hyannis Port, at their sprawling property in Palm Beach, Florida, and abroad.          Joseph P.

New York society circles continued to shun the Kennedys as ‘Irish micks’ and with the Swanson scandal, the Kennedys ‘found themselves even less accepted in polite society,’ according to the book.The ‘record of parental absenteeism shockingly high’ for the Kennedy kids, and the ‘general deterioration in the relationship between mother and father created an emotional wasteland,’ Hamilton wrote.On October 29, 1929, the stock market crashes, billions are lost and the United States is plunged into the Great Depression that follows. Kennedy Sr., however, ‘had shrewdly moved most of his investments out of stocks,’ according to the book.Joe is sent to the Choate School, the elite boarding school in Connecticut, while Jack attended a boarding school in New England called the Canterbury School. At 13, Jack has an appendectomy, and would leave Canterbury to follow his older brother at Choate, according to the book. Unlike Joe, Jack had a hard time conforming to the rules and struggled academically at Choate, and Hamilton said Jack\u0027s four years at the boarding school were ‘grueling.\u0027 Jack was popular with his classmates and had a reputation for ‘wit and clownishness,\u0027 and ‘on one occasion Jack stole a life-size cardboard cutout of Mae West from the Wallingford cinema and slipped it into his bed to shock the cleaning woman the following morning,’ according to the book.          The Kennedy children had several governesses growing up, and their father, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. had affairs during his marriage to their mother Rose, according to Nigel Hamilton’s ‘JFK: Reckless Youth.’ Above, the siblings sit on the porch steps of a rented house in Cohasset, Massachusetts in 1923-1924. Seated in descending order, from top step: Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., John F.

She had ventured abroad seventeen times in four years, but could not manage the journey to Connecticut, where Jack lay in the hospital further north,’ Hamilton wrote.Jack would bounce back again, and once healthy, would form a group called ‘The Muckers Club’ at Choate, which wasn’t about smoking or drinking but rather about planning pranks. Jack and the other members were almost expelled for a proposed prank but the headmaster reconsidered the punishment, which would have dashed the boys\u0027 Ivy League ambitions, according to the book.Kennedy Sr. pushed his children to be competitive with a winning is everything mentality, according to the book, and a school friend said that while at first the Kennedys appeared to be a ‘model family,’ over time, the \u0027storybook façade concealed an almost psychotic drama, with Mrs. Kennedy eclipsed by her ruthless, bullying husband and the tension of that unspoken interparental hostility pervading everything. The competitiveness Mr. Kennedy generate among his nine children was awesomely fascinating.’Hamilton added: ‘Perhaps most damaging of all was the sexual example Joseph Kennedy set for his children. Jack came home from school to having his father cover his bed with pornographic magazines ‘all open to display the female anatomy at its most immodest.’Jack would vie for ‘Most Likely to Succeed’ at Choate and win. By the summer of 1935, Jack found out that he got into Harvard and would be put on a path toward the presidency.          John F.

Now, pedestrian walkways are being reimagined for a 21st-century cityOn Pudding Lane in the City of London, the fateful alleyway where the Great Fire began in 1666, an unprepossessing staircase leads off the cobbled street. There doesn’t seem to be much reason to climb the steps, tucked away behind a row of granite columns at the base of a dumpy office block, but inquisitive walkers will be rewarded. Those who follow the stairs find themselves led along a walkway, shuttled across a bridge above a busy dual carriageway, channelled through a gloomy undercroft, finally emerging on to a deserted piazza raised above the Thames, with one of the most unexpected prospects in London: a wide-open river view. The Shard stands straight ahead, Tower Bridge rises to the east and the new tower of the South Bank sparkles to the west.This forgotten terrace, miraculously left uncolonised by a riverside dining concept, is a fragment of a larger vision that would have seen the entire City area threaded with a network of elevated walkways, punctuated by such squares in the sky. The “pedway” was an ambitious postwar plan to whisk pedestrians up from the car-choked streets of London and give them a utopia of streamlined paths and bridges, providing safe and efficient passage between the financial hubs of the Square Mile.The network was intended to stretch for 30 miles, from Fleet Street to the Tower of London, and from Liverpool Street to the Thames, but only a fraction was built, much of which has since been demolished. A few fragments remain, from plaintive bridge abutments still waiting for their connection to arrive, to winding staircases that lead to dead-end landings, scattered across the City like curious portals to a secret dimension.Just when the last remains appeared to be facing extinction, these floating walkways are showing signs of a revival. The London Wall Place project includes a new network of flying decks and serpentine walkways that thread their way around ancient chunks of the Roman city wall. Together with 21 Moorfields – the shopping mall at the new Crossrail station at Moorgate – they herald the beginning of an elevated journey where you will be able to go from Moorgate to the Museum of London without touching the ground.The parallel pedestrian universe was first hinted at by architects William Holford and Charles Holden, who drew up a plan for rebuilding London’s financial centre in 1947, after it had been devastated by bombing during the second world war. “There is, of course, even a functional pattern in the ant-heap,” they wrote, describing the jumbled network of alleyways and spaces that defined the medieval street network of the City. “The planner’s problem is to make this pattern more efficient.” Their plan contained a bold chapter on pedestrian ways that were to be “as fit for the traffic it carries as any of the main streets”, an idea that would inform the redevelopment of the City for the next three decades.The urge to separate pedestrians from traffic was nothing new: the construction of Holborn Viaduct, Rosebery Avenue and Clerkenwell Road in the 19th century were all attempts to sweep people up above the noise and grime down below. But the rapid growth of car ownership in the 1950s and 60s spawned increasing anxiety around congestion and collision, leading to the widely accepted belief that people and cars should be segregated for the benefit of both. The influential book Traffic in Towns, published by planner Colin Buchanan in 1964, set the mould for the hostile apparatus of flyovers, gyratories and ring roads that would proliferate across British cities for the rest of the 20th century.“It was because traffic engineers were in charge,” says Peter Rees, chief planner of the City of London from 1985 to 2014, now a professor at University College London, explaining the origins of the pedway. “It wasn’t driven by some great feeling of compassion towards pedestrians it was simply about getting people out of the way in order to speed up traffic flow.” With the new dual carriageways of London Wall and Lower Thames Street slicing right through the centre of the capital, pedestrians were lifted up on bridges so they wouldn’t slow down the cars.The doctrine of vertical separation informed the reconstruction plans for the major bomb sites of the Barbican and Paternoster Square, both designed with towers emerging from podiums, threaded with pedestrian walkways. The former remains a thrilling (if labyrinthine) brutalist Babylon of bush-hammered concrete bridges over bodies of water, christened with names such as Speed Highwalk. The latter was a bleak, barren expanse of elevated paving between dreary office blocks and, thankfully, no longer exists.Apart from these projects, the rest of the pedway plan was developed almost by stealth. An obscure City of London Corporation document published in 1965, mysteriously known as Drawing 3400B, mentioned the pedway by name for the first time and, within a couple of years, the provision of dedicated pedestrian walkways had become cemented in policy as a condition for securing planning consent.In a revealing documentary, Elevating London, Michael Hebbert, professor of planning at UCL, sheds light on the haphazard nature of the pedway’s evolution. “It was never really conceived as a system,” he says. “They didn’t even have a drawing of the network as a whole. It had to be constructed from the separate planning consents for inidual office blocks.” It was a British version of a postwar planning strategy that would eschew a top-down vision for an incremental network that would be negotiated on an ad hoc, site-by-site basis – and thus almost doomed to fail from the beginning.The piecemeal plan was to be lubricated by incentives. Developers were offered plot ratio concessions, allowing them to squeeze more rentable office area out of their sites, and permitted to use their pedway-connection platforms for temporary offices, giving them extra revenue while they waited to be joined to their neighbour – connections that would usually never arrive. Walking the streets of the City today, you can still make out chunks of unconsummated pedway at first-floor level that have remained glazed in ever since. Other sections have been spruced up: at Suffolk Lane, just east of Cannon Street station, a pedway ramp begins inside a grand neoclassical colonnade before emerging on to a bridge, recently clad in smart timber slats. A forlorn concrete bridge over Wormwood Street, meanwhile, has just been adorned with a traditional Korean house, impaled at an angle as if fallen from the skies, by artist Do Ho Suh. Redundant for their original purpose, these aerial fingers are becoming armatures for other inventive happenings.Beyond the lack of a joined-up masterplan, there were plenty of other obstacles to the pedway’s progression. Development didn’t proceed quite as quickly as had been imagined, while the fire brigade struggled to find equipment suitable for the walkways and the police were unsure of their legal powers on these new-fangled floating arteries. All the while, bills for maintenance, cleaning and lighting soared. But the main problem was that people didn’t use them. As Rees explains: “In as far as people carry mental maps to get around, those maps are based on streets. The minute you displace that map by taking people up on to walkways, their mental map function breaks down and they get lost.”The effort of going up a flight of stairs only to come down another also proved less attractive to many than the prospect of gingerly picking their way along the kerb of a dual carriageway. The growing conservation movement put up a strong fight, too. Looking at the 1963 map, it is not hard to see why, given that sections of pedways appear to slice right through St Paul’s Cathedral.With the Big Bang of the 1980s, which brought about deregulation, banks started to acquire larger sites to accommodate their dealing floors, making it harder to thread pedestrians through the buildings at first-floor level. A belated attempt to lure people up to the existing walkways with pubs, shops and kiosks came too late. Architect Terry Farrell’s Alban Gate, a gargantuan postmodern palace that straddled London Wall and was completed in 1992, was one of the few projects of the era that embraced the pedway, welcoming people with a theatrical drawbridge entrance, but few others followed suit, leaving the Barbican and Museum of London sites as quaint anomalies.So it comes as a surprise to walk along London Wall today and find a rusted orange steel bridge flung above the carriageway. This is London Wall Place, one of the most agile projects to emerge from Make Architects, which has reimagined the pedway as a more playful and generous version of the original, with decks wide enough to incorporate benches on which you might want to sit awhile, beside green walls and reflecting pools.It will soon be joined a little way to the north by Wilkinson Eyre’s 21 Moorfields project, the commercial bounty of Moorgate station’s Crossrail redevelopment, a 564,000 sq ft glass and steel behemoth that will be connected to the Barbican at first-floor level by a modern interpretation of the highwalk, welcoming you in to the inevitable podium of retail and dining opportunities. Like London Wall Place, it will be a hulking beast, but, as you are led through the sequence of walkways in a suspended realm between street and slab, you probably won’t even notice.The elevated network will end at the Museum of London site, where the new £250m Centre for Music is planned. The concert hall’s design is appropriately in the hands of Diller Scofidio + Renfro, architects of New York’s High Line, who have a penchant for aerial drama.The ultimate City-wide plan will never be realised, but, more than 50 years from its conception, these segments of pedway are being reincarnated in a more imaginative form than ever.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33068885489bf6e6a0b46f52e2eaebba63801b12/0_178_5395_3236/master/5395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1374ddeed48d9c6a41e7fd507d1eb234","title":"science men cern physicist research misogynist","story":"If anywhere were to be immune from our planetary post-fact plague, you’d think it would be the realm of nuclear physics. Cern – the nuclear research centre in Geneva, currently at the centre of a sexism row – spends a billion dollars a year looking for evidence of a particle, for goodness sake. These guys deal in facts like no one else. That didn’t stop the male physicist Alessandro Strumia using a speech at the centre to make the totally nonsensical claims that women have made no contribution to physics and now enjoy so much support to enter science that men have become victims of discrimination.I can only assume Strumia is following the well-rehearsed technique of making some essentialist comment that has no basis in fact, and then when hit by a backlash – Strumia has already been suspended by the University of Pisa – becoming a martyr, falling nobly on one’s sword at the hands of the militant politically correct.Only the politically correct, presumably, would get distracted by a history of women who have made fundamental contributions to physics, although many were denied the same recognition as their male contemporaries because, like Sophie Germain, who pioneered Napoleon-era findings on elasticity, they were shunned because of their sex or, like Rosalind Franklin, who discovered the inner structures of DNA, they died young or, as in the case of Hypatia, they were murdered by male zealots. And don’t dwell too much on contemporary statistics about women in science, which show that last year women made up less than a quarter of the UK scientific workforce. The global figure for women in scientific research and development roles is just under a third.I’m not sure how much Strumia elaborated – his comments have been removed from the website of Cern – which is led, incidentally, by Fabiola Gianotti, one of the most prominent women in physics. Perhaps he agreed with Tim Hunt, the University College London physicist who said in 2015 that the trouble with allowing “girls” into laboratories was that “you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them, they cry”.These scientists could be isolated misogynists. But I suspect there is something deeper going on. We live in a society guided by a set of highly gendered cultural beliefs about essential skills. Men, we are encouraged to believe – not least by a litany of self-help books – are rational, status oriented, competitive and, it’s probably reasonable to assume, good at nuclear physics. Women are empathetic, emotional, and good at communication and intimacy. Claims that women utter 13,000 more words a day than men, though regularly debunked by academics, help condition us into believing women really are much better at people skills.These ideas have always been problematic in themselves, but they are also loaded with an entirely new ideology. In the UK, for example, globalisation has created many more job opportunities in the service sector than in manufacturing. And these jobs – particularly when they involve direct contact with customers – place a premium on language and communication skills. Researchers have found that managers of call centres, for example, have internalised the beliefs about female verbal superiority, creating hiring biases in their favour.The result is a kind of lose-lose bind. Working-class male anxiety may well be linked to a sense – conscious or not – that men are fundamentally ill equipped for the employment of the future, while women continue to experience sexist stereotyping and crowding into lower-wage, lower-status roles. Because while having good emotional literacy helps with working in call centres, it is not a route to the kinds of highly paid leadership roles still dominated by men. It certainly does nothing to dissolve ancient biases against the capacity of women to work in science and technology.I can’t help wonder whether Strumia is performing a kind of territorial ritual. To borrow another outdated stereotype about typical male behaviour: if women are going to get the other sectors, then science, more than ever, should belong to men. Whatever men are doing, it’s certainly working. Until the physics Nobel prize was awarded to Donna Strickland this week, it had been 55 years since the last female recipient – there is not a single other living female physics Nobel laureate.The cause of these problems goes deeper than any words one man, or indeed all men, could utter. But language does influence behaviour. Academic language is so gendered I hope one day we will look back and laugh. We study for our “bachelor’s” degree, and then our “master’s”, and even if we are not in an institution of learning, we try to “master” life in general. I opened this column talking about “these guys”, which I must stop using, it’s hardly a neutral phrase. Less helpful self-help advice women lower their pitch, phrase commands like questions, and “approximate the popular linguistic stereotype of a man”. I’m not bossy, I’m the boss, the #banbossy movement tells us - correctly identifying the harmful effects of gendered language, but wrongly thinking that since the word “boss” is usually used for men, it must be better. And women who follow that advice are rarely described approvingly for “being in touch with their masculine side”, whereas men are highly praised for demonstrating sensitivity or emotion.It’s irksome in politics – where female leaders endure all kinds of backward behaviour. But in science, directly leading us into the dawn of evidence-based progress, it’s utter rubbish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c1cba5014a8604dc4672db98c529c6d7bc62245/40_0_4066_2440/master/4066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f485cc88f40227c45be838dab0223312","title":"tory conference government brexit","story":"What have we, the people of Britain, done to the Conservative party? Why do they hate us so much? As the odours from their annual feasting in Birmingham drift over the airwaves, I find my responses metastasising beyond the merely political and into the realms of the psychological.I get the sense that they’re punishing us, somehow. That there’s some deep-seated Jungian weirdness being acted out on the British public, every time the zealot Daniel Hannan vows to feed us his chlorinated chicken, every time Jeremy Hunt threatens us with his leadership credentials. It’s as if we (Britain) are the child. And they (the Tories) are the dysfunctional parents, ripping themselves apart, occasionally grabbing us by the wrists to prove some sort of point to the other.Theresa May comes up for air. She would like it to be known that she hopes to end freedom of movement within the European Union. She will remove – just like that! – our right to work in France or retire in Spain as that, she has decided, is what we want. She seems weirdly proud about it, too, a little bit “Look what you made me do.” But no member of the British public asked for this. No one made her do it other than the peculiar tribe to which she has pledged allegiance.There’s something similarly demented about Boris Johnson’s ambitions too. You don’t want this reckless narcissist in charge of the country. No one wants that. Aside from perhaps, a certain portion of the 120,000-odd people who are still perverse enough to be members of the Tory party – because it’s his turn. And somehow, by some convoluted ancestral logic, this is the wing who must be appeased, these are the appetites that must be indulged, these are the people who might actually decide.England, as George Orwell once wrote, is a family with the wrong members in control. There are the rich relations who must be sucked up to, the poor relations who must be spat upon, and it’s best not to ask too many questions about where all the wealth came from. And remember: “It is a family in which the young are generally thwarted and most of the power is in the hands of irresponsible uncles and bedridden aunts.” Just as adult family squabbles bring with them that same sense of “Why am I still dealing with this shit?”, so it is here: the patrician fossils aren’t talking to the reckless Atlanticists, and the oleaginous metropolitan wing is at odds with the racist granddads – and Cousin Jacob must have his special plate. Stop being the difficult one!Toxic introspection is not confined to the Tories. There is a certain species of Labourite who believes their own internal squabbles are of paramount interest to Labour voters too. But at least this tendency of the left was counterbalanced by a set of coherent ideas emerging from the Labour conference, a vision for the sort of country we might like to become. There is none of that emerging from Birmingham – no policies, no direction from our bedridden aunt of a prime minister.The reason all this feels more personal than political is that Tory dysfunction has already infected our lives. No one outside the Tory membership much cared much about the European Union prior to David Cameron calling a referendum. The 2016 vote was intended as a way of resolving the Tory family squabble. All it has done is impose it on the nation as a whole their problem is now our problem.And perhaps the most insidious effect is the way that Brexit has entered actual families too, setting children against parents, sibling against sibling, such that the word “Brexit” conjures something beyond mere trade deals and treaties. It has poisoned relationships, distanced generations, infected homes. For a party that is supposed to stand up for family values, that will be quite a legacy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1218770aaafc387f65f28df37c970d6565e2e613/253_26_5084_3050/master/5084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f47d577dcbd76d05e2645994e02d8cf","title":"never return teach england refuge abroad","story":"An estimated 15,000 teachers are snapped up overseas each year, driven away by the stress in British schoolsThe English education system is broken, says Freya Odell, a state secondary school teacher with 18 years’ experience. This month, she followed in the footsteps of thousands of other talented, fed-up teachers and moved abroad – in her case, to St George’s British International School in Rome.“It wasn’t a difficult decision. My job in England took over my life. Over the past year, I had stopped laughing and smiling. I had lost all sense of who I am.”Despite being director of learning, literacy lead and director of English at her previous school, Odell, 38, had to teach 20 out of 30 lessons and mentor three new staff. “I had to get up at 4.30am to get everything done, returning home at 7pm and working for another hour before bed, as well as at weekends.” She offered to take a pay cut to reduce her teaching load, but was refused.In Italy, she has been allocated the same amount of teaching but none of the responsibilities – and she will teach a class of 16 children, instead of 34. “If St George’s will have me for ever, I will never return to teaching in England,” she says.As the new school year gets under way, an Education Policy Institute report has highlighted how the government’s failure to recruit enough trainee teachers to stem the flow of experienced staff leaving the profession has led to a “severe shortage” in England’s schools.“There’s a toxic mix of factors, created by this government, that is making teachers decide they cannot teach in England in particular any more,” says Mary Bousted, general secretary of the National Education Union. “The low net pay of teachers means many cannot even afford rent. There is systemic overworking, with teachers routinely working 55 hours a week, and a vicious accountability system, which means teachers are not given the time and support to get better at what they do.” It reflects badly on the government, she says, that so many highly qualified teachers are going abroad. “It’s not that they don’t want to teach, it’s that they don’t want to teach in the context we’ve created in this country, and the government is responsible for that. We are haemorrhaging teachers, particularly at secondary school level.”Teaching timetables in the UK are similar to the OECD average. “But our teachers spend twice as long as other teachers in high-performing OECD countries preparing lessons, assessing and looking at data. It is that, combined with low pay, which is driving teachers away. The very measures the government has taken to police standards are decimating the numbers of teachers in the classroom and lowering educational standards.”Meanwhile, four in five British international school teachers say they are happy or very happy with their new jobs, according to the Cobis survey. “Other countries exercise much more trust in their teachers,” says Bousted. “They enable their teachers to concentrate on what’s important.”Over the next 10 years, it is expected that international schools will require up to 230,000 more teachers to meet staffing needs – 145,000 of them will be recruited from the UK, ISC Research predicts. If so, according to Schools Week, international schools could snap up more than half of all the UK’s trainee teachers over the next 10 years to meet their targets.According to Nick Gibb, the schools minister, more than 14,000 teachers returned to teaching last year, many of whom had been working abroad. “A period teaching in another country has always been an option which adds to a teacher’s experience,” he said.In Italy, Odell enjoys lower living costs and free lunches, so expects to be better off despite a lower salary. “I feel optimistic that I’ll develop as a teacher here while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance.”She says: “We had very limited resources. If you have a child with significant behaviour challenges because of childhood trauma, you need access to a clinical psychologist. For example, there was a child we worked with tirelessly to keep in school, to keep him safe. He absolutely needed specialist support but children’s mental health services said they were taking only life-threatening cases.”The child was later excluded from junior school. “Despite government spouting off about the importance of early intervention, it wasn’t there. Due to this lack of resources, the needs of very young children at my school were not being met.”The job left her with high blood pressure and, like her colleagues, she suffered chronic stress and insomnia. “I feel like I’ve done my bit and I was not prepared to compromise my personal health.”With 23 years’ experience as a teacher, 12 as a head, she found it easy to get a job abroad, choosing Jeddah because the teaching profession seemed highly valued there. Now her earnings are tax-free, her transport to work is paid for, and she has a complementary two-bedroom flat. “It’s the equivalent of getting a six-figure salary in the UK.” She is not sure she will work in Britain again.Jenny Anderton (not her real name), 51, who taught at state primary schools in southern England for more than 10 years, says that in the UK she was “more of a social worker than a teacher”. She is now teaching in Seville. “I love teaching, but it was frustrating at my UK school – there was a lot of paperwork and meetings for the sake of meetings,” she says.The last straw came when a child who had severe emotional issues was excluded. “I had flagged up that he needed help. He was a child in crisis.” Instead of supporting him, the school involved the police when he bit another teacher. Anderton’s wages are £500 less a year but she is confident she will be better off because of the lower cost of living. “I’m looking forward to being appreciated, rather than having the whip cracked over me all the time, and enjoying my job again, rather than being comatose at the end of every half term. The focus in the UK on attainment, when social services is on the brink, is bonkers and exhausting. I’m not planning to ever go back.”“Teaching in the UK is a thankless task,” says Victoria Mitchell, 39, who has taught at state primary schools in Nottingham for 11 years. She took a job at an English language school in Puglia, Italy, this month. “In the UK we’re set unrealistic targets and, compared to when I started, there’s little support. Things just get swept under the carpet.”She left a previous school after she discovered a leader from the academy chain lurking in the corridor, monitoring her teaching through a window. “I felt I was constantly being watched.”Her GP advised her to get a new job and, along with 11 other experienced teachers at that school, she did. But her new school was equally stressful. “Everybody was still under immense pressure. I love teaching PE, music and art and am passionate about languages. But in the UK, the focus is entirely on maths and English.”After holidaying in Puglia, she decided to send her CV to all the language schools there and received three job offers. “I chose the one that seemed the best fit for me.”On her last day of the UK summer term a parent yelled in her face. “I drove home from my final ever day in a primary school in this country in tears.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edadf29b9629799f47bfd59410d3263c5c2449cc/0_234_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a12539d8744ffee02978f99b1604f237","title":"10 steps to starting your own creative business","story":"If you like the idea of launching a startup, but you’re not sure where to begin, here are some top tips to get you going – from hooking the market to cooking up investmentFancy unleashing your inner entrepreneur and setting up your own business? For those with a creative streak, this can be a daunting proposition. You may see yourself as an artist, designer or maker rather than a business manager. But many creative businesses are thriving in the modern economy – such as in fashion and interiors, digital development and graphic design, advertising and marketing – and creative entrepreneurs are flourishing.If you can combine your creative ability with an entrepreneurial mindset, you could make a healthy living from your talent while retaining a high degree of independence. But competition in the creative industries is massive and fear of failure looms large for many people. So how on earth do you go about making a success of a new venture? Here are the key questions to ask yourself and issues to consider as you ponder starting out on your own.1. What problem are you solving?Business advisers say that every business idea should solve somebody’s problem. This may come as a surprise if, for instance, you are setting up a cake business. But since cakes are on sale everywhere, why are yours any different? They may solve the problem for people seeking lower calorie cakes or low-cost party cakes, for instance. Entrepreneurs can succeed by offering novel solutions to old problems.2. Test your productWhatever your business idea, it is essential to test that it has a strong appeal and a discernible market. This is the all-important market research stage, where you find out who your potential customers are and how they feel about your product. Only by market testing can you hone the product into something successful. You should be prepared to radically change the idea in response to trials before any wider-scale plans.3. Identify your customersDefining your market is a key element of market research. If you’re selling dog baskets then your target market is dog owners. The next stage is finding ways to locate and connect with them. Social media offers effective lifestyle targeting and is relatively cost effective.4. Research your competitorsBecome an expert on your competitors, find out their strengths and weaknesses and look for areas where you can outcompete them.5. Come up with a business modelThe business model is the method and means you use to run the business. Are you selling from a physical shop or via e-commerce? Do you take payment in advance or by subscription? Innovative business models help entrepreneurs thrive in existing industries that are already heavily catered for, as Spotify has in music (through its subscription model) and Uber has in travel (with taxis ordered and paid for via an app). Don’t be put off by having a product that is already widely available, just try and think of a new and interesting angle to market it.7. Raise financeThe boom in entrepreneurial businesses in recent years has been fuelled by angel investors and venture capitalists. These are talent spotters with the funds to back new ventures they believe in. Banks also lend funds to small businesses, though in the current climate they are highly risk averse. Any serious backer will demand to see a well worked out business plan. This needs to detail market research and present a strong argument about why the product or service will succeed. It needs an informed estimate of the funding needed and a prediction of future sales. Watch The BBC’s Dragons’ Den to see how easily such plans can be pulled apart under rigorous scrutiny. That said, don’t be put off by rejection. Persistence can pay off. And you could always try crowdfunding through Kickstarter, Indiegogo or Crowdfunder.8. Big bang, slow burn or delayed launch?If you have a new and exciting offer, a big bang launch can be a great opportunity for maximising publicity and gives a date to work towards. But many creative businesses will build up gradually as they gather a head of steam. It could be worth creating a launch further down the line when you have some business experience to boast about.9. Cashflow! Cashflow! Cashflow!Getting paid for your services in a timely fashion is vital to the long-term survival of the business. This may be out of the entrepreneur’s hands, but it is important to understand payment cycles in the industry and factor payments into sales projections.10. Can you bootstrap?Bootstrapping – as in pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps – means running your own business, at least initially, without external funding, and ploughing the income from your activities back into the business. For many creatives, this could be quite feasible, if they sell their services on a freelance basis anyway. Once your business idea takes off, the bootstraps can be untied as you start attracting interest and funding from venture capitalists. Fundamental to the successful businesses of the future will be the way in which they adapt harnessing the power of creative thinking and innovation.Falmouth University’s business school offers courses where creativity meets commerce, and ideas and entrepreneurship are given space to grow. Combining industry experience and academic study, students are given the chance to establish their own start-ups, initiatives or services as part of their degree.

But at the Chanel show in the Grand Palais, Karl Lagerfeld ensured that summer stuck around for a bit longer. The designer, who previously brought a Chanel supermarket and a rocket bearing the brand’s signature double “C” logo to fashion week, doesn’t do things by half. This time, a beach was recreated that included an ocean with gentle waves, blue sky, wooden docks and lifeguards. To complete the scene, the former Baywatch actor Pamela Anderson watched the proceedings from the front row.The sound of gulls signalled the show had started and the first model strolled through the waves, shoes in hand. The beach theme went on to include bikinis and swimsuits, sun hats, a bag shaped like a beach ball, macs for rainy days and a parasol print.However, Chanel didn’t forgo it’s signature style: models wore colourful tweed skirt-suits and some carried several handbags at once. Then there were the iconic logos: the show featured Chanel-emblazoned swimwear, jackets, knitwear, earrings and hair slides, much of which will appeal most to the millennials who lust after vintage Chanel from the 80s.This generation may also approve of the brand’s sustainability drive. In a post-show announcement, Chanel said the water used for the scenery would be reprocessed by the Paris sewage system and the sand recycled by the construction industry.Coco Chanel, the brand’s founder, had a longtime love affair with the beach. She would holiday in the seaside resort of Deauville in the south of France, and the sea was a constant inspiration, with Breton tops and sailors’ jackets featuring in many of her collections. She has even been credited with making sunbathing fashionable after being photographed in the 1920s after a Mediterranean cruise.The beach remains central to the brand. In June, Chanel launched the Coco Beach collection in 26 stores. The limited edition line features espadrilles, summer bags and cover-ups. And last month the fashion house announced it had bought the British men’s premium swimwear brand Orlebar Brown, whose fans include the UK’s former prime minister David Cameron. The acquisition joins Eres, a women’s swimwear brand Chanel bought in 1996."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c4ef18eb56eade0cb12ef6738e80385719036dd/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8112dcf3ea1fac27fee0a52173f80511","title":"out with the old in with the fold fashions new favourite trick","story":"From Calvin Klein to Zara, folding has staged a comeback – and even helps you to get away wearing the same outfit three timesThe fastest way to kill a trend is to put it on a politician. Just as William Hague killed baseball caps and Amber Rudd killed Perspex glasses frames, when Theresa May stepped into the Hyatt Regency on the eve of the annual Conservative party conference last weekend wearing a front-tying knot dress in sky blue – its third appearance to date – she killed the tied-wrap dress.This summer you could not move for a skirt or dress that tied at the side or front, a dress like May’s. Here, we used the word wrap so many times we had to think of new ways to describe it, recently settling on “drape”. It is a relief that as we encounter a new season, we find a new way to fasten our clothes.At current season Jacquemus, dresses folded at the waist to become skirts. At Calvin Klein’s spring 2019 show, the folding was a little more specialised – a tie-dye neoprene top folded over to become a miniskirt. On the high street, Zara has a grey cashmere skirt with an elastic band designed for folding, while Finery has a selection of jumpers in ecru and oatmeal with too-long sleeves, also meant to be folded back. New-season Levi’s include a pair of overalls with a hem folded over precisely an inch, while Asos has trousers and tops with in-built folds.In modern fashion, the discussion around folding started in the second half of the 20th century with Balenciaga’s 1960s envelope dress. By the 1980s it was loaded with meaning thanks to the deconstructionist movement, where prevalent Japanese designers including Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto used folds to “play with, conceal and change the human body”, according to the fashion historian Monica Sklar. This idea has stuck, she says. Folding is the opposite of a corset, it is neither tight nor restrictive and it is not gender-dependent. Folding your waistband might pivot on comfort, but in many ways it is a power move. You wear the clothes, not the other way round.If you ever rolled up your skirt at school, news that folding is “a thing” won’t set your screen on fire, although fashion’s latest take on folding is slightly more arch, being born out of necessity. For me, it started in 2017, when we reached critical mass for large sleeves. They ballooned and dragged, as if our arms had been swallowed by snakes, but no one dared to fold them. Then Off White created a dadaist jumper with the logo printed on to the folded part of the sleeve and suddenly we were supposed to fold our sleeves. Hallelujah. Our washing bills would finally dwindle.Elsewhere, we bought chinos – which were too long, but instead of hemming them, we folded the hems, so as to wear them with flats not heels. Victoria Beckham, a woman who has switched from heels to flats, tends to make trousers with folded hems for precisely this reason. The whole model of Celine under Phoebe Philo was anchored around trousers which you could fold and wear with Stan Smiths (then) or Veja trainers (now). The subtext was simple: practicality was standing up to fashion and it was winning.Sklar thinks there are three deep-seated reasons why folding has staged a comeback: iniduality, sexuality-slash-gender and a backlash against fast fashion. “It might seem tangential, the idea of personalising things by folding them,” says Sklar. “But in this age of Instagram, you need a tweak that distinguishes you from everyone else.” So if everyone is wearing overalls, then you need to undo one side, like model Adesuwa Aighewi.As for sexuality, “it’s about not subscribing to one notion of sexiness. And it’s not obvious. It’s about playing with what you reveal, and owning what you reveal. The slightly undone look.” And fast fashion? It is the bogof look – one skirt to wear three different ways. “Folding turns a garment into something else entirely. It’s art for art’s sake but it’s also upcycling,” says Sklar.Pre-folded clothes are not for everyone. The trick is to find the fold that works for you, and make it your own. Neon polo necks are this season’s base layer but try to fold the neck over once (it makes the neck look longer). Buy a skirt that is too long (try the tall section of shops) and fold the excess fabric over at the waist. Or simply make like Jennifer Aniston in early Friends and wear dungarees – see Ashley Williams, Marc Jacobs and Topshop – at half mast.

Coarsely mince or finely chop 200g of smoked streaky bacon and add to the chicken. Season generously and set aside.Grate 100g of fontina cheese then combine with 10g of finely chopped tarragon and a generous amount of black pepper. Roll the seasoned cheese into 4 balls.Divide the chicken and bacon into 4. Take 1 of the 4 pieces and roll it into a large ball, press a hollow in the meat with your fingers and place 1 of the balls of cheese into it. Close the minced meat around the cheese, making sure none of the cheese is showing. Continue with the other 3 pieces of mince. Place on a baking sheet and chill for at least 20 minutes. Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.Warm a couple of tbsp of olive oil in a shallow pan over a moderate heat, then lower in the little cakes, letting them brown sweetly on the base, then turn them over to colour the rest of the outside. Slide the pan into the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes until they are cooked right through and the cheese is molten. Serve immediately. Enough for 2.Chilling the cakes before cooking helps prevent them falling apart as they cook. You can do them a few hours in advance, but bring them to room temperature before you fry them. Minced chicken should always be cooked thoroughly.Season the meat as the fancy takes you. I have used tarragon, but garlic is good here, too, as is chopped thyme or lemon thyme, rosemary needles and dried oregano. In place of the fontina use a blue cheese, such as gorgonzola (wonderful if you have used chopped rosemary as a seasoning)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f047454ff473d7a506c894b9abec2758d98e1df/0_101_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=057e056eef10dbda844934e58fcf1c3d","title":"hoffenheim manchester city champions league match report","story":"Manchester City are spluttering at the start of the Champions League and needed a late David Silva winner to beat Hoffenheim. A scrappy display followed the opening defeat to Lyon and while Pep Guardiola can point to his side’s spirit and three points there will be concern.This was Hoffenheim’s home debut in the competition and Julian Nagelsmann’s side can be proud of knocking their heralded opponents out of their rhythm.City endured a nightmare start, going behind after less than 60 seconds owing to a sleep-walking defence. When Ishak Belfodil ran on to a slick pass, Aymeric Laporte, City’s left-back for the match, was left trailing and the Hoffenheim striker beat Ederson expertly.Cut to a stoney faced Guardiola and while City tried to absorb the shock Joelinton came close to creating a second, following a run down the right. Luckily for City his shot was hit straight into Ederson’s arms.The equaliser came straight from the Guardiola playbook: Leroy Sané got in behind Hoffenheim and Sergio Agüero fired past Oliver Baumann.Pavel Kaderabak was proving a danger. The 26-year-old winger’s pace was too much even for Kyle Walker and he might have won a penalty when going to ground.Guardiola had selected as strong an XI as he could, which meant Agüero at centre-forward, despite a heel problem. The match was the first of “five finals” the City manager spoke of during the buildup and as Hoffenheim lost at the weekend and are 11th in the Bundesliga City began as favourites.After half an hour City had established dominance as they peppered the Hoffenheim area with crosses and corners. Yet the tension was illustrated by Guardiola receiving a lecture from the referee, who was apparently unhappy at the manager for stepping out of his area.When Hoffenheim managed to move forward they usually threatened, which will have worried Guardiola. Belfodil skimmed a ball that Ederson did well to collect, then Joelinton hit a fierce shot the keeper beat away.Belfodil nearly scored again when the second half started with a near-mirror image of his opener but this time he flashed a shot across goal.Ederson went close to being embarrassed when he charged out to clear and missed the ball.Considering their callowness Hoffenheim were performing admirably. Yet when Sané was pulled down by Baumann it was a mystery why City were not awarded a penalty.By the close Hoffenheim were hanging on as City pressed for a winner that came when Silva ghosted into the area to stab beyond Baumann."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd0d1637c43a25c5b322d9a63501dba2f93d1f68/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c300c59a044c8103e85429eb0606474b","title":"mauricio pochettino ernesto valverde tottenha barcelona","story":"Mauricio Pochettino was, by his own admission, living inside the typical footballer’s bubble. Ernesto Valverde was the man who popped it and, boy, did it come as a shock. It was the summer of 2006 and Valverde had been installed as the new Eyol manager. Pochettino was one of the club’s senior players, the most influential voice in the dressing room.Too influential, Valverde thought. He decided he did not want Pochettino in the squad, having been led to believe he undermined his predecessor, Miguel Ángel Lotina. Pochettino has always denied this. “In football, there are people who live off confusion and you sometimes don’t know who the good and bad apples are,” he wrote in his autobiography, suggesting Valverde had been misinformed.But the decision was the decision and, at 34, it spelled the end of Pochettino’s playing career. He said his farewells at a highly charged press conference, in which he broke down in tears and had to leave the room to compose himself.It was tough for Pochettino to accept but time has healed the wounds and when the Tottenham manager encounters Valverde on the touchline at Wembley on Wednesday night, before the Champions League Group B tie against Barcelona, he will embrace him.“That day, it was difficult to understand his position but I talked to him in pre-season, when we played Barcelona in Los Angeles, and I completely understand,” Pochettino said. “He arrived at Eyol at not a good time for me. I could not see it at the time but I can now.“In football, you are always protected by this bubble and then, when somebody shows you the reality, it can surprise you. These things show you that situations in life and in football change very quickly and, when one door closes, many others open. I never wanted to be the victim and I am now going to face the coach who gave me the opportunity to become a coach.”Pochettino is pathologically opposed to presenting himself as the victim and, as he considered an injury crisis that has stripped him of four, maybe five, starting players, he was defiant. Hugo Lloris is back in goal after a thigh problem but Jan Vertonghen, Serge Aurier, Mousa Dembélé, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli are out – together with the backup goalkeeper, Michel Vorm.“I never make excuses if players are injured,” Pochettino said. “We are not going to win or lose because we have some players out. We believe we are going to win – with young players, senior players, I don’t care – because it’s Tottenham that is going to play. We need to build that mentality if we want to win some trophies. I repeat again. I am not the victim and I am not going to be the victim in football and in life.”Pochettino will attack the problems in front of him with gusto and yet, at the same time, he was happy enough to highlight them: to explain why this season “will be the most difficult for us”. He made the now obligatory reference to the delay in the completion of the new stadium and he gave the impression that it was unsettling the club have no base so they can merely busk it from game to game.Pochettino also flagged up the looming fixture black spot, in which his team must play four times in nine days – including the Carabao Cup tie at West Ham. It has been caused, in part, by the necessity to move the home match against Manchester City to Monday 29 October, because Wembley was not available on the day before and the new stadium is not ready.“The ambition is to win but maybe reality, and dreams and perception, are not in a good balance today,” Pochettino said. “It’s difficult to say if the team will be better or improve from last season because the circumstances this season are so tough.“Look at what is going to happen in the Carabao Cup. We are going to play on the Monday against City, then the Carabao Cup tie on Wednesday or Thursday and then we must play on Saturday at Wolves and in the Champions League the following Tuesday against PSV Eindhoven. It is completely unfair for a team that wants to win titles.“We don’t know when we are going to play in the new stadium and everything like this makes you more cautious to guess what will happen. We will see what happens at the end of the season when we will settle ourselves, the fans and the team in the new stadium. Then, we can start to talk about objectives but, today, we can only be focused on the next game.”Spurs are fortified by their Champions League victory over Real Madrid last season, although Pochettino pointed out he could not motivate the players in the same way. “That was the most important game they had played but since then, they’ve played at the World Cup,” he said. For Pochettino, the challenges keep on getting bigger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60478bdc559fa72fe4fe0ac09636f78df9f3cdb9/3_170_3910_2345/master/3910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aa52b66a5176c83eda64e688ed09b3c","title":"manchester united hammered sturridges stunner and hampden rumble football weekly","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Mark Langdon to look back at the weekend’s action.

Their Champions League campaign is back on track after that opening-day stumble, and their four-game losing run in Europe is over. Jamie Jackson was there, and here’s his report. Thanks for reading this MBM!We’ll hear from Pep in a wee while, no doubt ... but remember City’s neighbours are in action tonight also. Jacob Steinberg has all the latest news from Old Trafford.But there’s no time for the home side to put anything together, and the whistle goes! City get their Champions League campaign up and running. And deservedly so: they were the better team tonight, dominating the match ... though they left it late!90 min +4: Sane has a lash from distance. It’s miles over the bar, and allows Hoffenheim the chance to launch one Hail Mary attack. Before that happens, Aguero is booked for kicking the ball away.90 min +3: Aguero races after a long ball on the break. Baumann comes out of his goal and can’t intercept. Aguero rounds him on the left, but though the goal is unguarded, he’s right on the touchline and miles from goal. He shanks his effort wide left.90 min +2: Joelinton bustles his way past Mahrez on the left and enters the City box. But the ball he then delivers is neither cross nor pullback, and City close the door.90 min: Bittencourt has a dig from distance. It’s nowhere near. There will be four added minutes.89 min: Hack comes on for Demirbay. The home fans are stunned. City had been pressing, but were looking at the end of their tether. Then a sensational smash-and-grab by Silva!Just as it looks like being a frustrating evening for City, Silva sniffs out a goal from nothing! Bernardo Silva whips in a cross from the left. Posch should clear, but he chests down, assuming he’s got more time than he has. Nope! Silva nips in from his right and steals the dropping ball, then slams it across Baumann and into the bottom right! What a mistake by Posch, but what livewire brilliance by Silva!86 min: Kramaric threatens to burst into the City box from the right, but Stones and Ederson combine to put a stop to his gallop.85 min: Mahrez turns on the jets and makes ground down the right. But his cross flies straight down the throat of the well-positioned Baumann.84 min: City come straight back at Hoffenheim, the brilliant Sane earning a corner down the left with another audacious dribble. The set piece comes to nothing.83 min: Silva is knocked over 35 yards from goal. Free kick. Mahrez loops it down the inside-right channel, hoping Kompany can get a head on it, but the ball’s cleared.82 min: Bittencourt comes on for Grillitsch.81 min: City are dominating possession again. Hoffenheim are sitting back, hoping to see this out for a draw and a precious point against one of the favourites for this competition. They look very solid. But there’s still a long way to go against this relentless City side.79 min: A scintillating run by Sane, who fizzes his way to the byline on the left, then pulls the ball back for a certain goal. But somehow the ball evades Aguero, Mahrez and David Silva, as well as all the defenders, and harmlessly dribbles off towards the right touchline. How did he manage to thread the ball through that thicket?! Very odd do that another 99 times, and it’s a pinball game every time.78 min: Joelinton bundles Augero to the ground near the left-hand corner flag. Sane’s free kick is dreadful, a pea-roller that’s easily hacked back upfield.77 min: On the touchline, Pep holds his head in his hands, a study in frustration. City haven’t forced Baumann into serious action in this half.75 min: Sterling is replaced by Mahrez.73 min: Sane goes racing after a Bernardo Silva pass down the inside-left channel. He’s clear in the area. Baumann comes out and spreads himself. And Sane goes over him. That looks a clear penalty, the keeper having got nowhere near the ball, but the referee doesn’t give it. Sane is genuinely puzzled. I wonder if his effort to stay on his feet as he went over the keeper counted against him?72 min: Bernardo Silva slips and slithers his way past Kaderabek on the left. He strides into the area and chips to the far post for Aguero, who heads goalwards from six yards. But there’s no power on the header, and Baumann gets across to claim with ease. A real chance, that, and a sensational run by Bernardo Silva.70 min: City flick the ball around stylishly, but the gaps aren’t opening up in the Hoffenheim defence in this half. Eventually they get closed down: Aguero is barged off the ball, Sterling hustled out of it. The hosts are much improved in this second period.68 min: Gundogan appears to have pulled a hamstring. He’s holding the back of his right leg, anyway, and frowning quite a lot. On comes Bernardo Silva in his wake.66 min: Walker is booked for a hefty challenge on Kaderabek. His studs were showing there, and for a second he was flying through the air in the uncontrolled style. But he pulled back at the very last second, which might have saved his bacon.64 min: Otamendi is replaced by Stones, Guardiola responding to Hoffenheim’s big improvement since the break.63 min: Ederson claims the corner, then sets Aguero romping up the other end. But he’s soon dispossessed and Demirbay’s swinging another ball into the City area. The visitors only half clear. Then Kramaric tries to dance his way out of a tight space on the edge of the box he nearly wriggles free but can’t get a shot away. 62 min: Demirbay curls the free kick into the mixer, forcing Laporte to slap the ball out for a corner on the right.61 min: Demirbay looks to release Kaderabek down the inside-left channel. Kompany is forced to bump Kaderabek to the ground in the professional style. He escapees a booking, but that’ll be a free kick 35 yards from the City goal.59 min: Silva is upended as he meanders down the left. A free kick. Silva sends it long. Otamendi rises at the far post, and plants a header on target ... but it’s deflected over the bar for a corner. From the set piece, Fernandinho has a dig from distance. It’s gathered by Baumann, who immediately launches long for Belfodil. And he’s clear, chasing the long pass! Ederson comes haring out of his goal, hoping to clear, but misjudges the bounce. Thankfully for City, Sane has tracked back, and is able to make a challenge and clear the danger. But for a second, the goal was wide open for Hoffenheim!57 min: Demirbay is booked for a cynical clip on Silva.56 min: City ping it around awhile, then lose possession carelessly. Suddenly Hoffenheim break quickly, and Belfodil is stopped in his tracks unfairly. A free kick, and a chance for the hosts to load the City box. The set piece comes to nothing, but City have occasionally looked wide open at the back a sharper team than Hoffenheim might have caused them a few more problems.54 min: The first change of the evening, as Kramaric replaces Szalai.53 min: Sane sends a poor pass wide left towards Laporte. Brenet should intercept. But his challenge is tissue-paper weak, and Laporte breaks through it. Laporte reaches the byline, and fires to the near post for Silva, who tries to flick home but can only hoick it wide.49 min: City draw a little sting from the game, stroking it around the middle, lest Hoffenheim build up a head of steam.47 min: But once again Hoffenheim start the half strongly, with Belfodil sent into acres of space down the right. His ball across the middle might have been a cross, it might have been a shot. But the danger’s cleared. However the hosts come straight back at City, Grillitsch striding down the middle and unleashing a rising ripper that very nearly nestles in the top-right corner. Just over, and I think Ederson might have had it covered. But it was close.And we’re off again! No changes. City get the ball rolling for the second half, and get through the first 43 seconds unscathed this time. Half-time entertainment ... and it doesn’t come any better than David Squires.I have no idea how there were no goals in the final 37 minutes of that half. Glorious entertainment. City look the business tonight.45 min: Walker blazes down the right and whistles a ball along the corridor of uncertainty. Aguero isn’t able to get into the area quickly enough, and the cross flies out on the other side. “How’s Joelinton doing?” It’s Mac Millings again. “Putting a shift in? Because if he’s anything like my pal Joe Linton, he’ll more likely have nipped round the back of the school for a couple of Benson \u0026amp Hedges, or maybe even a quick toot on a jazz cigarette.”42 min: Aguero cuts in from the left and pearls a riser towards the top left. It’s inches over the bar. I think Baumann might have been able to fingertip that over, had it been on target, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it.41 min: Sane glides in from the left, then sends the ball wide right for Sterling, who crosses it back towards Silva. City’s movement is sensational. Hoffenheim are constantly having to make last-ditch interventions.

Within seconds, Aguero’s in space down the right his chipped cross very nearly finds Sane clear on the penalty spot, but Akpoguma eyebrows it away from the City winger.38 min: Sane dribbles at trademark speed down the left.

Piccini saunters past him and Pogba falls down in a manner that suggests he’s injured, enabling the right-back to cross from the byline. Rodrigo lays it off to Batshuayi, who rattles a sharp effort over the bar. Pogba’s fine again.66 min: “Come to think of it, “Keith Matic” has a nice ring to it,” Peter Oh says. “And I wonder how Wernham Hogg’s workplace morale compares to that in the United locker room and training facility these days.”63 min: Valencia struggle to clear their lines from the corner and almost shoot themselves in the foot, only for Lukaku to give away a free-kick when he catches Piccichi in the face with a stray boot. The visitors are edgy at the moment. It’s almost like United have worked out they aren’t particularly special.62 min: With Beckham still in his seat, it’s left to Pogba to take the free-kick. He summons a decent effort but Neto pushes it over.61 min: Pogba swerves a pass towards Sanchez, who’s bundled over by Gabriel, his former Arsenal team-mate. The referee awards the free-kick after a brief delay. The camera picks out David Beckham in the stands. The ball’s in a central position and 25 yards from goal. He’d fancy this.58 min: Smalling meets Sanchez’s driven corner but Neto easily claims the defender’s tame header. “Even FERGIE took a few years to get United motoring,” Simon McMahon says. “So let’s cut José some slack, eh? It’s not like he’s got a big city neighbour showing him how it’s done, is it? Or even a historic rival just along the road that are on the up. And a clean sheet is a clean sheet, right? Small steps etc. #believe #united”57 min: This is a good spell from United, with Shaw’s persistence forcing Piccini to concede a corner. Kondogbia glances Rashford’s corner behind for another corner over on the right.54 min: Sanchez sticks a ball into the middle. It lands at Rashford’s feet. Shot. Blocked. Kondogbia falls over and the referee decides to stop play as Rashford tries to run at Valencia again. Still, this is a bit better from United. “What does Matic do?” Liam Moseley says. “What are his strengths?”53 min: Sanchez tries to inject some urgency with a dart down the right. He hoofs a ball into the middle, looking for Rashford, and Piccini doesn’t do enough with his attempt to head away. The ball drops to Pogba but his shot’s deflected wide by Garay. Rashford’s corner is poor.52 min: A flowing Valencia counterattack falters when the commentator says the words “And now Coquelin...”51 min: Ryan Lukaku seems to have given up playing on the left already.49 min: Rodrigo turns and nicks a pass inside to Guedes, who curls one a yard or two wide from 18 yards. 48 min: Rashford is through the middle and Lukaku is on the left. Lukaku boots the ball five yards in front of him and out for a throw.46 min: Valencia get the second half underway and Kondogbia doesn’t take long to win a free-kick in United’s half. “I don’t remember Moyes’ or Van Gaal’s teams being this bad at home in the Champions League,” Eddie Munro says. “This is dire. You can see the lack of cohesion not just tactically but personally as well. Some of the players aren’t even talking to each other at all, the front 3 specifically. And thanks to Valencia’s (the team) lack of cutting edge it’s this weird purgatory where if you want United to lose so Jose leaves sooner, it’s not happening and if you want United to find some form and confidence from scoring, it’s not happening. Nothing’s happening, but it almost is, but it wont, but you hope it might, so you keep watching, but nothing’s happening.”Slow, plodding and unimaginative, and that’s just me. As for Manchester United, they are a tedious mess. This can only get better ... right?45 min+3: Shaw gives the ball away with a sloppy pass and Valencia probe down the right. Rodrigo’s cross drifts over Guedes.45 min+1: There will be three more minutes of this filth. Guedes cuts inside and shoots over from 20 yards.45 min: Parejo’s booked for grabbing and snatching and pulling Pogba’s shirt on the halfway line. He must really like that shirt.44 min: Pogba and Lukaku combine to send Shaw speeding down the left. Garay cuts out the left-back’s cross with his chest. The referee ignores appeals for handball.43 min: I AM BORED.40 min: This is a very boring game.39 min: Parejo blooters one over from 20 yards after another neat move from Valencia.38 min: Bailly’s back on. Scott McTominay can stand down.35 min: Bailly is still being seen to by the physio. Victor Lindelof is warming up.34 min: Bailly’s back on his feet. On we go, with Batshuayi holding the ball up and sending Guedes clear down the left. Can he make anything of this opening? Nope. The winger selfishly cuts inside, runs into traffic and sees a shot blocked. Poor. His end product hasn’t been sharp enough yet. Valencia have found so much space down the left. Bailly, meanwhile, has gone down again and needs more treatment.33 min: Bailly is down and receiving treatment after that blow to the throat from Rodrigo. It wasn’t intentional but it was pretty reckless from the Valencia forward.32 min: Sanchez fires the free-kick into the wall. Then Eric Bailly decides to shoot from 35 yards. It doesn’t merit a description. Up the other end, Rodrigo receives a booking for catching Bailly with a stray arm as he tries to control a high ball.31 min: Batshuayi bundles Pogba over 25 yards from goal. It’s over to the left of the D. Sanchez fancies this.30 min: Gabriel hacks Rashford’s cross behind for a corner. Can United exert some aerial pressure? Nope. Rashford sends the corner to the near post and Rodrigo heads away.27 min: Gaya sprays a pass down the line to Guedes, who’s run away from Matic too easily. Fortunately for United, the winger’s cutback isn’t good enough. Up the other end, Antonio Valencia crosses from the right and the unmarked Rashford sees his header blocked.26 min: Rashford turns and shoots straight at Neto from 30 yards.23 min: Old Trafford is quiet. Smalling knocks a simple pass out for a throw.21 min: Valencia are seeing a lot of the ball but they aren’t really going anywhere. Kondogbia gives possession away and Coquelin cynically brings down Rashford. Yellow card for the former Arsenal midfielder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961b2d7870f1d69aa1d0172adc5aae5ab5b6fedf/120_339_2769_1661/master/2769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b13365f3c7a854b7c31290ea25c401a","title":"aint no mountain fair enough how urban hiking can change the way you see your city","story":"Yes, most cities are peak-free zones, but you can still find challenging hiking conditions – all without a trip to the countryUrban hiking might sound like an oxymoron, but it’s actually a thing. There are plenty of maps, blogs and guided tours cropping up online (more about that below).So what is urban hiking? Well, it’s exactly what it says on the tin: taking on a challenging walk – perhaps at pace – in city and town settings, often with a view to racking up some considerable elevation. Much like a bracing country hike in the Peaks, Alps or Highlands, climbs and descents (either via hills or staircases) are something to be enjoyed and attacked, rather than endured.The appeal of urban hiking is obvious. It’s a great way for city folk to get more exercise without any fancy equipment, it’s a sport that enables locals to discover more about the history and background of where they live and it’s a handy way for older people to get active and to socialise. Best of all? It’s pretty much cost-free.Many of us love to ramble on a weekend away, so it’s odd that when we return to our urban lives we forget how to use our legs, hopping on the bus or tube rather than stretching our limbs. Urban hiking reverses this trend and makes sport of tackling lanes, mews and markets along the way. It can be educational too – lots of guides and maps encourage urban hikers to take in local landmarks and buildings, with notes describing their connections to the history of the area.There are plenty of ways to get involved, too. People living in towns and larger cities can simply look up walking tours aimed at tourists and join these organised treks and hikes. After all, they’re not just designed for the enjoyment of people who are new to the area. Be warned though, if you want to cover a considerable distance you’d be better off striking out alone. Urban walking tours aimed at visitors are often more focused on cramming lots of sites into shorter strolls and focusing on a particular theme or period in history, rather than packing in the miles (or hills).To take to the streets without assistance, you need a bit of preparation. But not much. Armed with a smartphone with a map app and a destination punched in, you should be fine. While a bit of pre-hike research will put you in better stead, you can easily find pre-made routes and loops online to suit your desired distance (and your appetite for hills). The website of walking charity Ramblers has plenty of maps and resources for newcomers and, once you’ve signed up for its free membership, you can get stuck into the in-depth routes and guides. You can also plot your own routes on websites such as Mapometer, which allow you to easily create maps to follow and share.One of the benefits of urban hiking is how little gear you need beyond the basics (and a bit of common sense). It’s sensible to take a small bag with essentials such as water, a sugary snack, such as an energy bar or flapjack, and a light rain jacket. If your phone’s battery is poor, it’s worth packing a back-up or charger, just in case.But beyond that, try not to weigh yourself down – you’re likely to never be too far from a shop, cafe or pub, so cut yourself loose from lugging too much garb. Oh, but don’t forget a box of plasters to treat any sore feet.Thankfully there aren’t any strict rules to adhere to when urban hiking (beyond those you’d normally comply with as a pedestrian), however, one tip is to not use the same road twice along a route. Or to put it another way, you should always aim to cover new ground and not double-back on your previous, outward passage.Other than that, you’re set. What are you waiting for? Pack your bag, pull on some comfy trainers, find a route and hit the streets. There’s a world of stairs to climb out there – last one to the top buys the ice-cream, beers or prosecco!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dea838322b41a323d140dd6b63fe477b31892f77/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc202c03b8c3fce09a29b273264e7f04","title":"the slow steady rise of conscious movement","story":"Forget high-intensity interval training. More and more people are realising that easy-going, thoughtful exercise can have surprising benefitsThis year, the Harper’s Bazaar list of “best new fitness trends and classes to try for 2018” included an incongruous addition. At No 7, wedged between hula-hoop body-toning sessions and trampoline fitness classes, was “walking” – plain, old-fashioned walking, that anyone can do for free. It seemed an odd choice of “new” activity to highlight in a list of fitness trends.The idea that walking is suddenly fashionable appears, at first, to be at odds with everything we’re told about where fitness is going – and the pace at which people want to be doing it. A worldwide survey of fitness trends shows that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is the most popular fitness trend in the west this year. In the UK, spinning is most popular, according to an industry report from UKActive and DataHub. Of course, the idea of fast, intense, time-efficient exercise that delivers insta-results fits in with how we see ourselves: as people whose lives are the busiest in world history. “I went for a walk” lacks the heroic ring of: “I just killed myself doing 50 burpees.” However, a deeper look at how people are exercising or, more importantly, want to be exercising, shows a different trend: a move away from the quick fix, back to slower (although not necessarily less difficult), more measured forms of fitness. “Conscious” is the word I kept coming across while researching this article: “conscious motion”, “conscious flow”, “conscious control”. Imagine the opposite of hurling your, perhaps uncoordinated body around a fitness class at high speed: that’s conscious movement. The idea is that, if you’re “conscious”, you’re doing whatever it is that you’re doing to your body with precision and a full awareness of the physical mechanisms at work – yin yoga is conscious, rugby is not.More importantly, it’s also about being self-aware enough to see the big picture, diagnosing your physical, spiritual and emotional needs. As you step back from your once-a-week spinning class you might become aware, for example, that you’re still a stressed, underslept commuter with a bad shoulder, dull skin, uneven muscle tone, a spine that has morphed itself into the exact shape of your office chair, an iffy diet and a soulless box-set habit. Having ascertained these things, consciously, you would then go about, best-case scenario, reconfiguring your lifestyle accordingly.The elite trainer David Higgins delivers bad news, however, for anyone who is hoping consciousness might mean not having to do any exercise at all. “The gym,” he says “is not a substitute for lack of activity during the week. It’s not, ‘OK, I’ve been sitting on my arse or lying on my back for 23 hours of the day and then I’m going to go to the gym for an hour.” Higgins was the first person I heard use the term “conscious movement”. “I don’t think most people have heard of it. I think it’s a new thing even though it’s been around for ever. I think, finally, people are realising that they don’t have to necessarily kill themselves to get major, meaningful results.”The way we’re living is not anatomically sustainable, he says. We should be integrating conscious movement into every area of our lives: lateral lunges in front of the TV rolling on our backs like children to loosen up our spines, to give two examples.“If you can find something that maybe takes you into your body a little bit more, then I’m all for it, rather than trying to escape from the stresses of life. Kind of internalise things a little bit and say, ‘How do I feel? What is my body saying to me right now?’”He says that HIIT is a quick fix whose practitioners often don’t have adequate control over their bodies to execute it safely. “That’s not where I’m coming from. I’m interested in longevity, postural control and a pain-free lifestyle. We are all going to have to look a bit more inwards if we are going to survive and live a happier, healthier, more pain-free life.”Those already doing conscious movement may be part of a wider step-change. A look at the sorts of classes on offer in Britain’s rapidly expanding independent exercise sector, for example, indicates a move towards less hyper forms of exercise. MoveGB gives its 300,000 users access to more than 6,000 physical activity providers across Britain. Its CEO, Alister Rollins, says that yoga, pilates and mind-body classes are “by far the most popular activity, with yoga at least twice as popular as a genre than any other single genre available on MoveGB” (the other three genres are gym and swimming fitness classes outdoor activities and climbing). “Mindful exercise such as yoga and pilates are growing in popularity as the market becomes more educated to holistic wellbeing, whereas HIIT once was on the top of everyone’s list for fast-hitting results,” he says. “Consumers are becoming more in tune with their bodies and the impact that mindful exercise can have psychologically.” He points to an increase in “niche yoga classes – for example, yoga for climbers and yoga for cyclists”. Yoga that is, in Higgins’s words, mitigating against any damage you might do yourself in other sports.Beyond yoga and pilates, what else counts as conscious movement? LIIT – low-impact interval training – is a good example. And a good example of LIIT is the government’s nine-week Couch to 5K initiative, where your three runs a week begin with a five-minute walk, followed by 15 minutes of walking and running split into one- and one-and-a-half-minute intervals. LISS – low-impact steady state – is another form of exercise where you’re using conscious control, whether swimming, running, jogging. And high-intensity fitness workouts have created their own niche in mindful exercise: “active recovery”, a short, low-intensity workout that aims to increase blood flow, metabolism and joint movement, has become a popular class for adrenaline junkies on their days off – or for people who have injured themselves in class.Niki Rein is the founding CEO of Barrecore, a dance-inspired workout that has expanded from one studio to 12 in a decade. Barrecore “integrates the fat-burning format of interval training, to exhaust each major muscle group, with static stretches which lengthen your muscles and offer relief”.How would Rein describe conscious movement? “When you’re not counting on momentum to execute the movement. If you imagine doing a slow bicep curl – you’re feeling the muscle on the front of your arm as you raise your hand up towards your shoulder and you’re feeling it on the back of your arm as you’re extending the arm straight. That would be a conscious movement. If you’re doing something at speed, you’re not necessarily working the entirety of the muscle and injury is more likely to happen over time. We try to work every single muscle in the body in a conscious way and you can really feel those imbalances. So, when you start seeing results, you understand why.”Rein thinks the current fascination with high-intensity exercise is linked, firstly, to the false assumption that exercising faster gets better results and, secondly, to the bragging rights that come with saying: “I’m busy.” “People feel guilty if they don’t say they’re busy. For a long time I set a bad example to my staff by not doing any self-care. There’s a lot of value placed on being busy and I think it’s a scapegoat for not keeping fit, for not eating right, not getting a pedicure, having dinner with friends. The term ‘self-care’ is growing and is helping that issue.” For those wanting the hit of a strong workout with the benefit of self-care, she recommends a mixed class such as yin-yang yoga: “Strength yoga followed by flow and yin so you don’t feel guilty for not getting in what you think you need, but you’re also getting what you probably need the most.”Walking, explains Harper’s Bazaar, somewhat awkwardly, is “often not even considered a sport and when it is only for those around retirement age”. But however unintentionally, the magazine has hit on possibly the biggest driver of conscious movement – a desire for healthy longevity. “I’m 35,” says Higgins, “and I’m looking at the long-term approach unlike the 20-year-old trainer who’s had zero stress in their life and can’t understand why you can’t get to the gym every day. I want to be a grandad one day and live as long as possible, obviously. If you get injured, you get ill, you suffer from pain – then what the hell is the point?” David Higgins’s book The Hollywood Body Plan will be published by Headline on 27 December, priced £25.

He said the series, which stars David Tennant and Michael Sheen, was written after Pratchett sent a letter on his deathbed urging him to create a TV adaptation.“He wrote me a letter saying: ‘You have to do this because I want to watch it before the lights go out. You have the passion of the old girl that I have.’“Then he died, which made it a last request, so I spent 18 months writing six scripts, reinventing it as television while trying to stay faithful – because we have tens of millions of people who would murder me if it’s not – but I wanted surprises.”Good Omens was originally in development exclusively with the BBC but the scale of the production meant a partner organisation was needed. Gaiman’s experience working with Amazon on that project prompted him to sign the exclusive deal.Other forthcoming Amazon shows include the psychological thriller Homecoming, starring Julia Roberts and based on a successful podcast, and Carnival Row, starring Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne.The service also announced it had picked up a third series of the German drama Deutschland 83, which will go out under the name of Deutschland 89.Netflix and Amazon services are investing billions of pounds in original content. There are no independent figures on how many people are watching their programmes, although more Britons now pay pay for a TV streaming service than subscribe to a traditional pay TV broadcaster.In the UK, Amazon Prime Video is bundled with the wider Amazon Prime service, which offers unlimited next-day delivery on Amazon goods for £7.99 a month. Netflix’s basic package costs £6.99 a month, although customers have to pay more for HD streaming.

But the bottom line is that Boris is essentially still second rate. A man who imagines himself to be a latter day Winston Churchill, but is nothing more than an ersatz Donald Trump with little to offer other than his own narcissism masquerading as cheap populism.Yet in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, and Johnson is what passes for stardust in the Brexit circles of the Tory party. A faint flicker, raging against the dying of the light, as he struggles to avoid being sucked into the black hole. And for his one scheduled appearance at a fringe event, hundreds of delegates were queueing outside the 1,500-seater hall some two hours before he was due on stage. This was the golden ticket. A message of hope for the hopeless.Shortly before the start, the usual VIP suspects began to fill the front row. David Davis, Steve Baker, Priti Patel, Owen Paterson, Andrea Jenkyns, John Redwood and Andrew Bridgen. The same crew that had been at almost every “Chuck Chequers” event. None of whom most sane people would trust anywhere near government. The scene was set. This wasn’t going to be a serious speech so much as an act of communion for the already converted. A greatest hits rally at which Boris would deliver his own Boris tribute act.Johnson bumbled on to stage. Bumbling was what people expected of him – his trademark trope – and he didn’t want to disappoint. The audience rose to give him their first standing ovation and he relaxed a little. He still had the magic. “It’s great bumble bumble to be bumble bumble in Birmingham bumble bumble,” he bumbled, before insisting that he was standing before everyone “with all humility”. Always good to get the first lie in early. Boris has never done humble in his life.After that he was straight on to autopilot. A lot more bumble bumbling, a bit of hair tugging and the occasional thump of the lectern to suggest he actually cared about what he was saying. Pretty much the same speech he had given the time before and the time before that. The same feeble gags about Toblerones and bus shelters that never failed to get a few desultory laughs from people starved of genuine humour. The same sob story about how he had once felt sorry for a couple in a Wolverhampton council house. The same lies about things the EU had never done and what the Labour party planned to do. Always the lies.Bumble bumble. Loud whoops from the audience. Bumble bumble. The same broken record of why Boris thought that Boris would make a great prime minister and couldn’t believe that the whole world didn’t agree with Boris. He ran through a totally uncosted housing programme he did a drive-by shooting of Michael Gove he boasted of his record as foreign secretary. That last bit didn’t take long.Then Boris turned his attention to Theresa May and Brexit. Chequers was against the law – it wasn’t, but what the hell? – and Britain was being cheated. What was needed was someone like Boris who would bumble bumble, make Latin references, ruffle his hair and say that Britain could be great again if only we believed enough. Someone who lacked even the basic level of self-awareness to realise he had broken the system and had no real idea how to fix it. Someone whose only visible plan was to say sod off to the EU and that if it was very lucky we would let it trade with us again sometime in the future.Same old, same old. A vision of the future in which Boris was prime minister and the country was condemned to a seventh circle of hell in which the same speech, the same jokes, the same Latin, would be played on a loop indefinitely. Then a rare moment of clarity. Pathos even. Boris looked down at the front row and saw just a handful of the same hopeful faces. He might have the numbers to stop Chequers, but he was way short of what he would need to become prime minister. His speech bumble bumble tailed off into silence. As so often, he had made a splash. But the waters would soon close over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11b93cfc10d7b5eaa9f039dc1ee5bc5247391f19/0_19_2034_1220/master/2034.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0954a3f32a857dc792ce83649e09b0ed","title":"malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad calls jews hook nosed","story":"Mahathir Mohamad reignites accusations of antisemitism, blaming Jews for Middle East troublesThe Malaysian prime minister has described Jews as “hook-nosed” and blamed them for creating the troubles in the Middle East – reigniting accusations of antisemitism against him.Mahathir Mohamad, who at 93 became the world’s oldest head of government after starting his second stint as prime minister in May, has for decades been accused of antisemitism for his attacks against Jews, whom he has accused of perpetrating a humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories.“If you are going to be truthful, the problem in the Middle East began with the creation of Israel. That is the truth. But I cannot say that,” he said in an interview on BBC’s Hard Talk.Calling Israelis “special”, Mahathir challenged historical accounts that 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, saying the figure was 4 million.When asked about the description of Jews in his book The Malay Dilemma, he said: “They are hook-nosed. Many people called the Malays fat-nosed. We didn’t object, we didn’t go to war for that.”The Anti-Defamation League, a US-based organisation against antisemitism, was not immediately available for comment but attacked Mahathir’s “decades-long record of antisemitic conspiracy theories” in a tweet in May. “The world cannot accept this from any leader,” the tweet read.Last week, when addressing the UN general assembly in New York, Mahathir said the world “rewards Israel” for breaking international laws and committing acts of terrorism against Palestinians."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/196ca70240300e9df81de529a854f9cf455271c7/0_97_5418_3251/master/5418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b24859ffcd15806eac600a89b6030c9d","title":"manchester student union to replace clapping with jazz hands","story":"Move is designed to help students with disabilities such as anxiety or sensory issuesManchester University’s students’ union has become the latest student body to vote to replace applause with “jazz hands” in an attempt to make events more accessible for people with disabilities.At its first meeting of the academic year, the union voted to use British sign language clapping, which involves waving your hands in the air, instead of audible clapping, at events.“This union notes that since 2015, the National Union of Students (NUS) has been using British sign language (BSL) clapping (or ‘jazz hands’), as loud noises, including whooping and traditional applause, can pose an issue for students with disabilities such as anxiety or sensory issues,” the motion read.The union resolved “to swap audible clapping out for BSL clapping at SU events in order to make them more accessible” and “to encourage student groups and societies to do the same, and to include BSL clapping as part of inclusion training”.In a statement, the union said that the vote did not constitute a ban on clapping and that BSL applause would be used at democratic events and not gigs, theatre productions or sport.They said: “Inclusivity is one of the students’ union’s founding principles. We recognise that minority groups are underrepresented in political environments and we are working to address that. This policy is one way of doing so inside our union.“We have already received many positive responses from disabled students (some of whom are deaf or autistic), who are pleased to feel more included in our democratic process.

Speaking at the time, Nona Buckley-Irvine, the then general secretary of the London School of Economics students’ union, told the BBC: “Jazz hands are used throughout NUS in place of clapping as a way to show appreciation of someone’s point without interrupting or causing disturbance, as it can create anxiety.“I’m relatively new to this and it did feel odd at first, but once you’ve used jazz hands a couple of times, it becomes a genuinely nice way to show solidarity with a point and it does add to creating a more inclusive atmosphere.”A spokesperson for the British Deaf Association said it welcomed any steps to make events more accessible for deaf and disabled people.“Sign languages are languages within their own right, with their own grammar, syntax and idioms,” the association said.“For many people, they are also languages of necessity and of access. The uptake of the ‘wave’ applause used by many sign language users shows us that access measures can have positive knock-on effects for an even wider group.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c4f9925bed6b84a5a7dd62e76e2aff9f600ae66/0_173_5201_3120/master/5201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e80c1c8722711050387cbc8b5e126f98","title":"ballboy tennis fernando verdasco novak djokovic","story":"It’s little surprise that Fernando Verdasco snapped at a ballboy in China last week. Our job was fun, but we were also taught to soak up abuseDuring my three years as a ballboy at the Miami Open I learned that, like a waiter at a Michelin-starred restaurant, we should be invisible unless summoned.The players’ rage and adrenaline often smother the court, so when Fernando Verdasco snapped at a ballboy on court at the Shenzhen Open last week for being a millisecond late to deliver his towel, I was not surprised. I doubt the boy at the end of Verdasco’s anger was either: the job’s core is to tend to the players and umpire. The best ballpeople tether themselves to the wave and ride, although they still deserve respect.It’s not like the job doesn’t have its perks. We got free tickets and tennis gear, but the greatest prize was the privilege of being close enough to our idols to talk to them and – if you’re into sweaty athletes – smell them too. Between 2009 and 2011, I was lucky to be on court with every player – male and female – in the world top 25, except Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Juan Martin del Potro. Andy Murray could be grumpy but he was never abusive. Novak Djokovic and Gaël Monfils were fun and kind, but Marcos Baghdatis, who once told us jokes throughout a memorable doubles match, was my favorite.Not everyone was as easy to deal with. Andy Roddick refused to pocket a ball or move a centimeter from his path to receive one. Your toss, with one bounce, had to land on his racket. Roddick wanted his towel after every point. And he played fast, so you had to pay full attention to his body language. On days when players like Nicolás Massú and Michaël Llodra, both notorious hotheads towards the end of their careers, were slated to be on court, the program director would call a meeting and warn us that if we were cursed at we should stay silent and still.Beside discipline and fitness, the key strength for ballpeople is knowing the players’ superstitions. For example, although I was never on court with him, it was known that Nadal likes two water bottles, placed at his right foot. You were to hand them over for him to place. He always drinks the bottle on the left-hand side first, and places them delicately back in the same spot when he is finished. It’s been the same through his brilliant career. Upsetting his routine would likely end your chances of working in the big matches.The Miami Open made sure we were ready for the demands of the tournament. The program director boasted the Miami Open was second only to Wimbledon in the quality of its ballgirls and ballboys. Nearly 300 candidates tried out over the course of four Sundays before the tournament. The drills could be unorthodox: one measured how long we could keep our arms straight up in the air. We had to arrive at 7.30am sharp for the trials, and if you were late, you were instantly cut. During suicide sprints, the drill sergeant, an ex-military man, accused tired joggers of “hotdogging”, though no one knew what that meant. He would also make “boing boing” noises at heavier, slower runners.Once you were in, it was great. You were a fundamental part of the tournament, with the best seat in the house – as long as you didn’t mind dodging 135mph aces from Ivo Karlovic. But we were always told we weren’t the main event, the players were – and we understood they would show flashes of temper. Releasing tension is necessary in a high-pressure environment, and on each point, their earnings were on the line. The job of the ballperson is to make it as easy as possible for players and they know that. But there’s a balance, and sportsmanship and respect are truest virtue of the sport. Verdasco should know that most ballpeople are either volunteers or making minimum wage – they’re really there for the love of the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0351b714422504d2567ea013a921a3fda7b5cb9e/0_160_4602_2761/master/4602.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db03953b091d68cf2569a438a3b0546b","title":"joe marler suspended avoid england duty rugby union","story":"• Harlequins prop says comments have been misinterpreted• Marler was contacted by the RFU for clarificationJoe Marler will not face any disciplinary action from the Rugby Football Union over comments outlining how he used to try to get himself suspended in order to avoid England duty. It is understood Marler was contacted by the RFU for clarification over his remarks but the matter will not be taken any further.The 28-year-old announced his surprise international retirement last week, less than 12 months before the World Cup, and speaking to The Rugby Pod, he explained how his anxiety would lead him to seek a way out of England camps. Marler said: “The anxiety I would get about having to leave and go away again would start to manifest itself in giving away even more dull penalties and looking for outs, looking for a yellow card, looking for a red card, because if I could pick up a ban, that’s an easy way out without actually pulling the trigger.”Marler subsequently wrote on social media that his comments had been misinterpreted. “I have never deliberately done anything on a rugby pitch – or off it – to get a ban,” he said. “I was simply reflecting on my occasional irrational behaviour when England camps were looming and trying to understand my actions a little bit better.”The timeline of Marler’s recent ill-discipline correlates with impending spells away with England. Marler was named in the England squad to train in Bristol at the start of last week but pulled out for personal reasons on the Sunday before his decision to retire was made public. The day before, during Harlequins’ defeat by Bristol, he received a yellow card for a forearm to the shoulderhead area of the opposing scrum-half Andy Uren. “I played like an absolute helmet, which often happened around England time,” he added. “That mindset manifested itself. After that game, I said: ‘I can’t keep doing this. It’s not fair on my family it’s not fair on the club’.”Earlier this year, Marler missed England’s Six Nations matches against Italy and Wales after he was suspended for six weeks for a dangerous clear-out on Sale’s TJ Ioane and in October 2017 he was banned for three weeks for striking Wasps’ Will Rowlands in a Champions Cup match, forcing him to miss England’s opening match of the autumn against Argentina. In addition, Marler’s spat with James Haskell – for which he received a citing commissioner’s warning – during a different match against Wasps last September occurred just five days before Eddie Jones named an England training squad.Last week Marler cited a desire to spend more time with his family as the key driver for his decision, adding that he was unable to fully give himself to the England cause after winning 59 caps across six years. He has also explained that he weighed up the financial benefits of delaying his retirement, with England players receiving around £25,000 per match, but revealed he had already given serious consideration to taking the decision before the summer tour of South Africa in June.In 2016, Marler withdrew from England’s summer tour of Australia due to the mental strain that came with the furore over his “Gypsy boy” comment to the Wales prop Samson Lee during the Six Nations a few months earlier. He was eventually banned for two matches and fined £20,000. In his first match back from that ban he picked up another two-week suspension for kicking Grenoble hooker Arnaud Héguy in the head.Marler revealed that, because he had previously withdrawn from that tour of Australia, his conversation with Jones had been straightforward when informing him of his international retirement. “The relationship with I had with Eddie, based on what I did in 2016 and the Australia tour, he knew that if I had decided something , then that was it,” he said. “I pulled out of that tour. So there wasn’t a lot of chat he could give to change my mind.”In the aftermath of Marler’s announcement last week, the Rugby Players’ Association expressed its concerns that more internationals could follow his lead – a view echoed by the former England captains Phil Vickery and Lawrence Dallaglio, who has championed giving senior players sabbaticals as New Zealand have done in the past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/014532e19918fb5ca8fb8fe84180d02ea2d900b5/456_154_2359_1416/master/2359.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ceb41b200ae0851d4242c8f6666cf2d","title":"wakefield england squad autumn internationals rugby league","story":"The Wakefield duo, Tom Johnstone and Reece Lyne, believe the club’s first England call-ups for almost a decade are worthy recognition for the progress the Super League side have made in recent years, after they were among five debutants named in a new-look squad for the autumn internationals.With six of the squad that reached last year’s World Cup final injured, Wayne Bennett has drafted in a number of new names: including Johnstone and Lyne, who will almost certainly make their Test debuts against France on 17 October before the three-match series against New Zealand.Castleford’s Adam Milner, Wigan’s Joe Greenwood and the St Helens prop, Luke Thompson, are the other new call-ups, and Johnstone, who along with Lyne, could become Wakefield’s first England internationals since Ryan Atkins in 2009, admitted it is just reward for the club’s development.“It shows the club are going the way we want it to,” he said. “We’ve had two consecutive top-five finishes, three lads in the Super League Dream Team and now call-ups for England. It shows we’re not the bottom-four, struggling side we used to be and we’re working towards something special.”Johnstone’s inclusion is no surprise after he scored 24 tries this season, but Lyne’s perhaps is. The 25-year-old has been promoted from the England Knights – who name their squad for the tour to Papua New Guinea on Wednesday – and revealed he wasn’t even confident of a call-up to that squad, let alone the senior side.“I really wasn’t even expecting to go to Papua New Guinea with the Knights, it was more a case of hoping I would,” he admitted. “To then get that call from the senior squad, I’m over the moon. The group we’ve got here at Wakefield is really special and that’s played a part in my form.”Nine of the 17 that narrowly lost last year’s World Cup final are included, but Gareth Widdop, Kallum Watkins and James Roby are among those who miss out due to injury. The series begins in Hull on 27 October, before Tests at Anfield on 4 November, and Elland Road on 11 November.Bennett said: “It’s important that we build on the positive work of the last couple of years, including last year’s World Cup and the Denver Test, against what we’d expect to be the usual stern challenge from the Kiwis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1110387d26e1131e1276e77af114503b7b20725f/0_54_4743_2847/master/4743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55e5563f5c22023091243c7d83dee7e0","title":"mrs dalloway review virginia woolf arcola","story":"Arcola, LondonA cast of five take on more than 20 characters in Hal Coase’s experimental adaptation of the novelVirginia Woolf’s 1925 novel about a day in the life (and life in the day) of Clarissa Dalloway, a high-society wife in postwar London, is not an easy story to adapt for the stage. It jumps from past to present and from one character’s stream-of-consciousness to another.The writer Hal Coase meets Woolf’s experimentalism with his own. In the first scene, actors appear in costume but out of character. “I live in London,” says one. “I’m terrified,” says another. They speak about Woolf’s 1924 essay on the primacy of character, Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown, and quibble about how the play should begin stopping, starting, and narrating their lines from a lectern to stall our suspension of disbelief. The complications of staging an adaptation are exposed, but it all feels awkward and overplayed.Actors talk to each other but also speak their thoughts into a handheld recorder in a modern version of the theatrical aside. Sometimes they speak in unison as if a chorus a single scene contains multiple time and place perspectives, jumping from London to Milan in one moment, and from past to present. The book’s magnificent vistas of London are not presented visually – a white curtain is drawn to reveal a small blue board that symbolises a clear blue sky – but described instead in imaginary word-paintings.Many of these experiments don’t work, but Coase’s endeavour should be commended for its creative risk-taking. The five-strong cast perform the parts of more than 20 characters: Clare Perkins plays Clarissa with authority while Guy Rhys inhabits the haunted figure of Septimus Smith, a first world war veteran suffering from shell-shock through which Woolf played out elements of her own psychosis. Clare Lawrence Moody is a particularly strong presence (as Clarissa’s friend, Sally, and tutor, Doris Kilman, among others). Ultimately, though, their multiple voices and personas create a confused cacophony rather than a polyphonic orchestra of inner and outer worlds.Occasionally Thomas Bailey’s production comes together, such as in Clarissa’s party at the end, which is staged as a press conference and filled with spirited social satire. Such scenes have a bold, brave clarity of vision, but they are too few and far between."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0516c98e3481bb7e5a74ce8db9747f85a0e68846/0_727_6009_3606/master/6009.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f86836893cee769ff67a9fd5f496ad1","title":"theresa may drag queens interview prime minister","story":"Hard Brexit innuendos, frolics in fields of wheat, that strong and stable obsession … four drag queens reveal why the prime minister is camp goldThe UK drag community had been waiting for someone like Theresa May to come along. We had David Cameron – not camp. Gordon Brown – could not be less camp. So we were ready to take any hint of glamour we could get. Then Theresa wore a leopard-print kitten heel and we’ve been dining out on it for years. The number of queens I’ve seen singing Fields of Gold by Eva Cassidy as Fields of Wheat – I’d say it’s more than seven.My show is about Theresa going into Brexitland. It juxtaposes all the positive things she’s said about Brexit, through gritted teeth, with what Alice says when imagining what Wonderland will be like. And obviously Alice’s Wonderland turns out to be something quite different.I have performed it for politicians. The Labour MP Dawn Butler walked out. Maybe she didn’t want to be associated with something so anti-Brexit. I performed it once for the leader of Scottish Ukip. He loved it. He stayed right to the end of the night, dancing until 3am.I think a shift happened in drag just as Theresa came into power. A decade ago, British drag was 40-year-old men in sequins in pubs, lip-syncing Shirley Bassey. Nowadays, it has more serious things things to say. But part of me wonders whether the appeal with Theresa is simply the fact that she’s a woman, there being an expectation that it’s men who should occupy roles of power. Also, male politicians never have to worry about a load of drag queens doing a number on them – although there are a lot of Donald Trumps out there, because he’s so camp.After last year’s calamity, what’s your advice for her conference speech? Whenever I’m losing my voice and have to sing, I do a splits jump just before each high note so the note is drowned out by the audience whooping.The best job I ever had was working in a horror maze in Brighton, so I wanted my Theresa act to be terrifying. And politics at the moment is terrifying. When I come on stage, there’s a projection of a broken Union Jack and I do the first speech Theresa made as prime minister: “We will make Britain a country that works, not for the privileged few, but for every one of us.”But I slice this up with my version of the Grand High Witch, the character from Roald Dahl’s The Witches. As the act goes on, the wig comes off and everything gets darker – a bit like what happens when you delve into Theresa’s background and see what she said about Section 28.Everyone had their take on the whole Theresa versus Andrea Leadsom leadership race. Andrea was all lovely and smiley and floral, while Theresa was menacing. It reminded me a lot of The Witches, especially when Andrea dropped out, and so I started using the book in my act. Andrea had one bad headline and boom! Gone! It must have been witchcraft.The Witches starts by saying: “Real witches dress in ordinary clothes and look very much like ordinary women.” It also says they “hate children”. I don’t think the Tories care about the future of young people. I’ll never be able to buy a house – and now Brexit has happened, I might not be able to work overseas. So that was themotivation for my act: they want to destroy young people, like the Grand High Witch.It should be celebrated that we have a women in power, and it could be seen as misogynistic for me to call Theresa a witch. At the same time, though, there are a lot of empowering witches – like Fiona Goode in American Horror Story, Willow in Buffy. I hope Theresa takes it on the chin.Conference advice: When in doubt, just stick to the Macarena, hun.I had my eye on Theresa when she was home secretary but it’s only since she’s been prime minister that I’ve been doing her properly. You can have a real laugh with her. She’s a total pantomime villain – the way she carries herself is so menacing. When you see her come on TV, you just want to boo and hiss, which my audience often does.Our show’s strapline is: “A hot and sweaty Brexit.” When you sit and listen to what our politicians are saying – “a hard Brexit”, “strong and stable” – it’s such a double entendre, it’s farcical. It’s the kind of material drag queens have been waiting for.I love the idea that Theresa has this naughty side. I think: “What happens after hours with her husband, Philip?” The cabaret night I run is called Theresa May’s Legs Akimbo. I host the whole evening as Theresa, doing a few numbers myself. Last night, we did a communal singalong to Any Deal Will Do, to the tune from Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat. I also do a number as Marilyn Monroe, called Brexit is a Girl’s Best Friend.People could say that me dressing up as Theresa May in fishnets with my bum out is disrespectful, but then I would say she’s not been very respectful to the LGBTQ+ community or other minorities. It feels powerful to perform as the prime minister – and it gives me the opportunity to highlight these things in a way that doesn’t make it too politically preachy.This summer, she invited quite a few LGBTQ people to No 10 for Pride. So the last time I did the performance, I gave her the line: “Oh, I love the gays.” That said, I’ll be sad when she goes. Boris Johnson’s Legs Akimbo doesn’t quite have the same ring to it.Conference advice: Theresa needs to speak with the same gusto she gives running through a field of wheat. And if all else fails, she should channel her inner drag queen and give the audience a good hard Brexit innuendo. They’ll be putty in her hands!I started doing Theresa May in my show Like a Sturgeon, in which I perform as Nicola, the leader of the SNP. I’m from Edinburgh and I love her. She’s my biggest inspiration. The indyref really galvanised people: I don’t think Scots would have ever felt this renewed sense of identity if it weren’t for the SNP.I wanted to start exploring characters who were the antithesis of everything Nicola stands for, so Theresa was the obvious baddie. It was 2016, just after Brexit and the departure of David Cameron. I thought: “We finally have a real Conservative villain.” She’s very Dickensian, there’s something of Scrooge about her. I could picture her creeping up the stairs, candle in hand, swiping coal off people.As time has gone on, I think she’s weakened, what with all the U-turns. Now I play her as a more subservient character, a very shaken woman who jumps when someone rings the doorbell. The act is her tearing herself to shreds. She’ll say something then contradict herself. The whole show is based on things she’s said and done, like allowing Boris Johnson to just walk out of the cabinet of his own accord.She does a few camp numbers – a bit of Victoria Beckham’s solo material, a bit of Sophie Ellis Bextor. I describe my show as endurance lip-syncing. I constantly change into different female political figures: Arlene Foster, Angela Merkel, Theresa May, Melania and Ivanka Trump. I think any woman who comes into a position of power – especially if they have a catchphrase and two iconic pieces in their wardrobe – will immediately become fodder for anybody on the drag scene. Theresa repeating strong and stable, strong and stable, meant she just became a parody of herself overnight.She may not have been a gift to the country, but she’s definitely been a gift for the drag community.Conference advice: If she plans on sticking anything on the wall again, double-sided tape just isn’t going to cut it. I suggest a strong spray adhesive. It will last longer, plus the fumes will make the conference a lot more interesting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87acb964e09491736bfbec4d4dd4a959b78b3bad/0_36_3327_1996/master/3327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66ff65abbf4e8332d936aa7783370ac9","title":"amazon raises minimum wage us uk employees","story":"Company says it has ‘listened to its critics’ as it increases US rate to $15 and UK to £9.50 Amazon has raised its minimum wage for British and American workers, in a major milestone for campaigners pushing for pay increases to tackle rising levels of poverty and inequality.The company, which has become almost a byword for low-paid and low-quality work in recent years, said it would increase its US minimum wage to $15 (£11.57) an hour for more than 350,000 workers. In the UK 40,000 permanent and temporary staff will get an increase to £10.50 an hour in London and £9.50 across the rest of the country.Jeff Bezos, the multi-billionaire founder of the e-commerce company who is also the richest man in modern history, said: “We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead.“We’re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.”Lifting the minimum wage is designed to tackle the firm’s critics head on. But some economists said the move was becoming a necessity as a result of labour shortages on both sides of the Atlantic.Amazon has faced intense criticism in recent years over pay, working conditions and the company’s tax affairs around the world, which critics claim have helped it undercut traditional retailers. Protests took place across Europe this summer by workers demanding higher pay. However, the company said there were no plans for pay rises in countries other than the UK and the US.Bernie Sanders, one of the company’s most vocal critics, said other companies should now follow Amazon’s lead.News of the pay increase comes only a day after Philip Hammond, the UK chancellor, said Britain was ready to put a new digital tax on web companies. Donald Trump has also attacked Amazon for its tax affairs in an ongoing spat with Bezos.Last month, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, attacked Amazon for not paying the living wage and said the company “leeched off the taxpayer” by paying too little in tax. The new US and UK minimum wage will apply to all workers, full and part-time, seasonal employees and temporary workers hired by recruitment agencies.Union leaders welcomed the move but said Amazon still needed to improve its employment practices. Observers pointed out that a US worker on the $15 minimum would need to work for at least 133 hours to buy just one share in the $1tn company.Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said trade union pressure had prompted the pay rise, adding: “The fight goes on to improve working conditions and get this company to pay its fair share of taxes.”Undercover reports have found some Amazon workers needing to urinate in plastic bottles for fear of missing draconian productivity targets, with life in its warehouses described as being akin to a prison sentence.Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said raising the minimum wage was only a start and shouldn’t be seen as an act of generosity.“If Amazon is really serious about looking after its workforce it must recognise trade unions. And it must end the exploitative working practices that have seen hundreds of ambulances called to its UK warehouses,” she said.It added: “We pay all taxes required in the UK and every country where we operate.” It also added: “We respect the inidual rights of our associates to join a union.”American workers, led by those in the fast-food industry, have been demanding an increase in the minimum wage as part of the Fight for $15 campaign. The US federal minimum wage, set in 2009, is $7.25, which Amazon said it would now lobby to have increased.Walmart increased wages for its 1 million workers to a minimum $11 an hour earlier this year, while Target, another US retailer, has raised minimum pay to $12 an hour and has promised $15 by 2020.Falling levels of unemployment in the US have started to help workers demand higher pay, leading to the fastest wage rises in nine years.In the UK a slowdown in the number of EU workers arriving since the Brexit vote, together with record job vacancies, has made it harder for UK companies to find staff, with potential to force companies to increase pay. Retailers including Amazon are also likely to need more staff ahead of the Black Friday and Christmas shopping season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ada86054c762266c044af9591be506f8ed028ed/0_33_5150_3089/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=609c1b4a947a8f2d52a3baed2de0df52","title":"us national trails wilderness walking scenic favourites hiking","story":"To mark today’s 50th anniversary of the US national trails system, six hikers and outdoor writers pick their favourite routes across the American wildernessLength: 3,700 milesRoute: St Louis, Missouri, north-west over the Rockies to Oregon By Bart Smith, as told to William R BuckThe Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail follows the expedition of Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, sent to explore the West by President Thomas Jefferson in 1804. They began near St Louis, Missouri, continued to the Pacific Ocean, then returned – a round-trip that took over two years.In 1992, I began a quest to walk all 30 routes in the national trails system. After 25 years of travelling these trails — “walking down a dream” as I have called it — this week I take my final steps on the Lewis and Clark Trail in St Louis, Missouri. Lewis and Clark also ended their journey here in 1806 and I will join in celebrating their achievement as well as the 50th anniversary of the trails network.The Upper Missouri River Breaks in Montana is one of the best stretches of the trail. East of Great Falls I loaded food and supplies into a canoe and began a long voyage downstream, passing the same places Lewis and Clark saw on their trip home. There’s a sublime beauty there that captures the romantic view of the American West.Having walked 34,000 miles across America, as I paddled down Class I rapids I was fascinated, and felt humbled by the ever-changing landscape and geological features of the Upper Missouri. On one afternoon, an eagle flew directly overhead, then an osprey circled above the eagle. As the two birds circled ever higher into the great blue yonder, I sat in wonder, gazing up, watching the osprey get ever smaller until it simply vanished. • lewisandclark.orgBart Smith has walked and photographed all 30 national trails in the US. His photography can be viewed online at walkingdownadream and in this  gallery Length 2,650 miles Route Mexico to Canada, through California, Oregon, and WashingtonBy Monica PrelleDescribed as a “wilderness path in our backyard”, the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), goes through 57 major mountain passes, dips into 19 major canyons and meanders alongside more than 1,000 lakes and tarns. For those who don’t have the months – or stamina – needed to walk the entire route, it is broken into sections for shorter, multi-night treks and within those sections are plenty of options for day hikes along the national trail. One of my favourites of these is the seven-mile High Trail with its views of the jagged peaks of the Minarets and other summits of the Ritter Range in California. The river flowing through the polished glacial rock below is dramatic, but it’s the void between the high mountains and low valley that makes onlookers feel small.“Everything is flowing,” the naturalist John Muir wrote of the region, “going somewhere, animals and so-called lifeless rocks as well as water.”Starting at the Agnew Meadows Trailhead near Mammoth Lakes, the High Trail contours the west slope of the Sierra Nevada crest and stays above the river before meeting the headwaters of the San Joaquin at Thousand Island Lake. The High Trail-PCT is in the Ansel Adams Wilderness, which s more than 230,000 acres between the John Muir Wilderness to the south and Yosemite national park to the north. I often join this trail – skiing in winter and backpacking in the halcyon days of summer, but mostly running, stopping often. I watch the trail change through the seasons. Snow falling and melting, wildflowers blooming and withering. I see aspen leaves transition from green to yellow, orange and red.My dad, who was never an avid hiker, once went for a walk on the High Trail and returned at dusk so tired that he went to bed without dinner. He told the story of that long walk for the rest of his life.At Thousand Island Lake, the PCT continues north to Yosemite, but the 3,000-metre alpine lake is the final destination for most day hikers. Muir called it Islet, for its abundance of tiny granite islands.

A quarter of the trail (550 miles) is in Virginia. Its highest point is 2,025-metre Clingmans Dome in the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee.By Philip WernerIt is the camaraderie of hikers that makes the experience of walking this trail, established in 1937, so special. The Appalachian Trail is a melting pot of nationalities and people of all ages, occupations, social classes, races, and religions. People who hike the trail congregate at the lean-tos each night, spaced every 10 miles or so along the trail, and tell their stories, comparing notes on how they are coping physically. An estimated three million visitors hike portions of the trail each year, which is within driving range of major cities such as Atlanta, Richmond, Washington DC, New York, and Boston. Each year about 2,000 “thru-hikers” complete the trail in one continuous trip lasting from five to seven months. Others hike sections over years to complete the entire trail.The many shorter sections include routes through the Shenandoah national park, and the White Mountain national forest.There are no fees or permits required to hike the trail, which links existing trail systems through numerous national parks, national forests, designated wilderness areas, state parks, and other public lands. It is maintained by an army of volunteers who build shelters, repair eroded sections of trail, and repaint the 150,000 white rectangular blazes that mark the route from one end to the other.My favourite section is the 100 Mile Wilderness in Maine, just before you reach the northern terminus of the trail and climb Mount Katahdin (1,605 metres) in Baxter state park. It’s a wild and rugged stretch of mountains, forest, and lakes with little vehicle access and takes 6-10 days to backpack end-to-end. I prefer hiking on the trail in mid- to late- September when it is ablaze with autumn colour, the nights are cool and the biting insects have disappeared.• 12 easy section hikes on the Appalachian TrailPhilip Werner has been section hiking the Appalachian Trail since 2007.

The CDT showcases one of the most spectacular parts of the world: the snow-covered Rockies, alpine wildflowers and high-elevation forests. This is a place of massive scale, where remote, rugged lands ide the watersheds of the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.Of the “Triple Crown” of long-distance routes (along with the Appalachian and Pacific Crest), the CDT is by far the least-used of the three.Yellowstone national park, on the Wyoming border, has grizzly bears, bison and wolves – but be sure to give all wildlife a wide berth and research current conditions. Turning west the trail intersects with the Nez Perce historic trail, a path of untold stories from one of America’s most celebrated tribes.When camping on the CDT, you can see the stars more vividly than in most places in the US (as long as forest fires aren’t smoking up the skies). Trail towns and gateway communities across the country play an important role in the trail experience (see map). These are places with unique culture, good food, parks and activities appealing to different interests. Silver City in New Mexico and Lincoln, Montana, are two towns that enrich the trail experience.I have walked the many varied routes across the national trails system, but the CDT remains one of the most special to me: it encapsulates the promise of our public lands, vast landscapes that preserve our wild and scenic treasures for future generations – and for wildlife.• The Continental Divide Trail Coalition has free guides and maps.

My favourite follows the edge of the last Ice Age from east to west across Wisconsin.Until 12,000 years ago, massive ice sheets blanketed all of Canada, with the southern fringe of the glaciers dipping down past the Great Lakes. The Ice Age national scenic trail follows a zig-zagging line of rock piles called moraines and other ice age relics – such as long ridge lines called eskers, large boulders called glacial erratics and small basins left by melting ice chunks called kettle ponds – for over a thousand miles. Many of the textbook-worthy geographical features along the trail are protected in the Ice Age national scientific preserve, part of the US national park system.Wisconsin’s rolling landscape alternates between mature forests and open fields connected by streams and rivers that flow into thousands of lakes. The trail meanders along the shore of Lake Michigan, before plummeting south of Madison, the state capital, and then heading north again to undulate across the western half of the state, linking numerous state parks and rural counties. Large sections of the trail, marked by yellow blazes on trees, rocks and fenceposts, are designated hiking-only footpaths others follow scenic backroads perfect for cyclists.This is my favourite long-distance trail because its unique focus on the region’s geological history transports hikers back in time, to an era when the landscape was all wilderness. As you walk, ride or drive in the footsteps of the woolly mammoths that once grazed the lush grasslands cultivated by the retreating glaciers, keep your eyes peeled for porcupines, foxes and black bears. And at night, your ears may ring with the howls of wolves: about 1,000 grey wolves live in Wisconsin, about a third of the endangered Western Great Lakes population.

She is the author of Aerial Geology: A High-Altitude Tour of North America’s Spectacular Volcanoes, Canyons, Glaciers, Lakes, Craters, and PeaksLength 93 milesRoute A circuit around Mount Rainier, Washington, giving views of all sides of the Cascade’s highest volcanoBy Peter PotterfieldRising from its lowland valleys like a vision, 4,392-metre Mount Rainier is the highest of all the snow-clad volcanoes of the Cascade Range. And the 93-mile Wonderland trail offers a truly intimate connection with Rainier, as the route makes a complete circuit of this magic mountain through the moody, rugged wilderness at its feet.The simple desire to climb Rainier was the very thing that brought me to the Pacific Northwest decades ago. There I was, puking on the summit with the other pilgrims who had climbed too high, too fast. Only later did I realise that time spent in the backcountry around the mountain can be even more rewarding. The allure here is the tremendous variety of terrain, which makes for fascinating backcountry travel.To hike all 93 miles of the Wonderland, a designated Recreation Trail, is to take in all the majestic nuances of Mount Rainier’s domain. The 360-degree view of the mountain, under volatile weather and changing light, is reason enough to come. The cathedral-like ancient forests of Douglas fir and western hemlock, the expanses of lovely alpine meadows (locally called “parks”), the high volcanic ridges, and the 35 cubic miles of ice draping the rocky flanks of the mountain all combine for a landscape unique in the lower 48 states. At high points along the route, such as Panhandle Gap, the hiker is taken deep into the alpine zone, into the realm of ice and snow far above the trees.Just be prepared to do a little work. Distinctive radial ridges called “cleavers” reach from high on Rainier right into the surrounding backcountry. These ridges create serious topography, a successive series of obstructing ridgelines above valleys deeply dug by raging glacial torrents. These require multiple climbs above 2,000 metres from deep green valleys, taking the hiker into a high, austere wilderness of ice and rock. Going up and over these ridges means the backcountry traveller who makes a complete circuit gains more than 6,000 metres of elevation in those 93 miles.Not everyone has the time or inclination to hike for months on the longer-distance trails. In my opinion, shorter trails such as the Wonderland bring the biggest reward for time and effort applied.Most hikers set out from the village of Longmire and do the Wonderland in 12-14 days, a period that allows for a relaxed pace, time to appreciate the scenery, and a rain day or two. You can do all in a single push, or in sections over several seasons – even over a decade in two- or three-day stints. The trail is usually hikable from mid-July through September, but depending on the previous winter’s snowfall, trails above 1,800 metres may be covered in snow into August.

But can it be reformed?It is no secret that I hate The Apprentice, because this hatred tends to manifest itself in articles about how The Apprentice should definitely end now. Such as this one that I wrote in 2014 and this one I wrote in 2015 and this one I wrote in 2016, that effectively blamed the entire current US administration on the morality of The Apprentice. Last year, like an ageing covers-band hauling itself back onstage for a mediocre Freebird encore, I reverted to the hits and wrote something about how, you guessed it, The Apprentice should definitely end now.But none of these articles actually worked. The Apprentice, despite being roughly as enjoyable as getting pelted with sun-hardened donkey dung, inexplicably remains a thing. It is still a miserable, joyless, Brexity slog about big-tied dickheads failing to make any money in a series of repetitively menial tasks, then getting shouted at until one of them gets to leave in a taxi. But I cannot kill it. So, fine, you win and I lose. Hooray for The Apprentice. Whoopy doo.But if The Apprentice is going to remain bizarrely uncancelled for the foreseeable future, can’t we at least try to make it better? I have some ideas on how to improve the series, and I’d happily welcome yours. Together we can make this dreck very slightly less abject.My biggest gripe with The Apprentice is that every single episode is identical. If you have seen one, you have basically seen them all. A large part of this is down to the tasks, which invariably involve selling things. Sweets. Soap. Snacks. Part of the reasoning behind this obsession with selling is that it plays into Alan Sugar’s origin story as someone who got his start flogging scrap metal to the Krays as a toddler or whatever, but it is tedious to watch. Not only is it predictable (oh look, they are cold-selling to shops again) but it simply is not how businesses operate. Let’s have a more realistic episode where the candidates are dropped into a real-life failing business and have to sack some real people in person. Let’s have one where they are investigated for tax fraud. Let’s have one where they brace for a no-deal Brexit. Anything – anything – not to have to watch them sell sweets again.Nothing would improve The Apprentice like making the candidates live off their earnings as the weeks go by. So, in week one, they sell some sweets. There are eight people in the team, all working two full days to acquire and sell products, and at the end they make a group profit of £200. Instead of celebrating this as a towering achievement like the show usually does, let’s ide the winnings between everyone. Each candidate gets £25 for the task, or £12.50 a day, or just under £1 an hour to spend on food and bills and tax, and that is all they are allowed for the week. Let’s see how many private jets you can buy with that.One reason I hate The Apprentice is it celebrates denial of culpability. Whenever a team member messes up, it becomes their duty in the boardroom to protect their own failings by blaming everyone else with an increasing level of genuinely unpleasant viciousness. If they succeed, they are allowed to stay. If they crack and admit that they were actually at fault, they almost definitely end up being fired. Every significant problem this country faces stems from people who were unwilling to admit their own mistakes. It is ugly, and I blame The Apprentice for it.Fourteen years. The Apprentice has been on the air for 14 years (15 in the US), and every single candidate has been a dipstick. No matter their age or background, they’ve all been aggressive, oblivious, self-interested dipsticks. You’d have hoped that the dipstick well would have run dry long ago, but no. In fact, thanks to quotes such as: “There’s no need to watch your back when I’m already two steps in front,” they are perhaps more dipsticky than ever this year. Imagine how great it would be if you could actually relate to one of the contestants. Imagine if any of them, even for a single fleeting moment, were actually nice? Obviously this would kill the show if it ever happened, but you won’t hear me complaining about that.The Apprentice starts Wednesday 3 October at 9pm on BBC One"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99137837ef27e342c7682dd4f03f9c9e61bf0de4/0_105_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8d076cf020650c712e65bc34377f99d","title":"rupaul dragcon nyc in pictures","story":"RuPaul’s TV show Drag Race has brought drag queen glamour and wisdom into the living rooms of families worldwide.

The era of Portuguese colonialism was ending, the fight for independence that would become one of the many proxy battlefields of the cold war was intensifying and, after three months spent on dangerous roads and in a capital city growing more paranoid and hallucinatory by the day, the Polish Press Agency reporter was spent.“My money ran out and I am barely alive,” he wrote. “It is more or less clear what will happen, which is that the Angolans will win, but it is going to take a while and I am on my last legs.”Kapuściński, long acknowledged as one of the greatest journalists of the 20th century for his literary evocations of wars and revolutions in Africa and Latin America, was right on both counts.He was haunted by what he had seen, what he had done – and what he had failed to do – while the nascent conflict he had chronicled would stagger on until 2002.The experience provided him with the raw material for Another Day of Life, his deeply personal book “about being alone and lost” in the chaos and confusion of Angola.Eleven years after Kapuściński’s death, the book has been adapted into an award-winning film that mixes animation and documentary to retell and update the story.The idea came to the film’s co-director, Raúl de la Fuente, and his producer and partner, Amaia Remírez, when they were on holiday on Menorca 10 years ago. The Spaniards had loved Kapuściński since they were teenagers, and saw Another Day of Life as both a geopolitical parable and a portrait of a journalist enduring a dark night of the soul.One of the main challenges they faced was how to evoke the sense of confusão “a state of absolute disorientation” – that permeates the book. The answer lay in Kapuściński’s two-notebook habit: one for straightforward, factual reporting one for impressionistic observations and reflections.While De la Fuente and Remírez travelled to Angola to shoot documentary footage and track down the book’s surviving protagonists, the Polish animator Damian Nenow took on the task of translating Kapuściński’s brutal poetry for the screen. “His descriptions of the world and how it changes are pure animation – they just cry out for animation,” says Nenow.The journalist’s thoughts, fears and recollections are rendered in surreal sequences of disintegrating cities, bodies and even a fragmenting telex machine. In one of the film’s most stunning scenes, Kapuściński and an Angolan journalist, Artur, come across a long stretch of road littered with the corpses of civilians, and imagine them being slaughtered by a cloud of weapons that roils a red sky.“We never debated whether it was right or wrong because it somehow felt natural in the context of Kapuściński’s writing,” says Nenow. “This guy wasn’t following facts per se he was always showing the world through the prism of the emotions of the people he met. He was always adding a lot of allegorical magic and poetry to it.”Accusations of “not following the facts per se” – or of simply inventing episodes – were levelled against Kapuściński in a biography published eight years ago, which claimed he had crossed the line between reportage and fiction.Nenow acknowledges the controversy, but says Kapuściński remains an iconic figure in Poland, where, he says, people have long been aware of his approach. “Kapuściński’s books are obligatory in school you have to read them when you’re a teenager. So it’s not a surprise for any Polish person – it’s not rocket science – that he was not strictly following facts.”Another Day of Life ends with the journalist speculating as to the fates of some of those he met in the confusão of 1975: Artur, the bright young guerrilla Carlotta, and the Che Guevara-like figure of Comandante Farrusco, a Portuguese special forces soldier who swapped sides to fight for liberation.It was that epilogue that gave De la Fuente his way into the film, which is released in Spain this month and is due to reach British cinemas next year. “I had the chance to go back to Angola with my camera and look for them, and say, ‘Look Ryszard, here’s Artur’, who feels like the biggest loser in the war because the society he wanted never materialised, ‘here’s Farrusco’, who’s still a soldier, ‘here’s Carlotta’s sister’. I felt I had to fulfil a commitment to him and I wanted to answer his questions.”Not long before he died in 2007, Kapuściński and Farrusco managed to speak by phone with the help of the Polish ambassador in Angola. The former commando, who still addresses people as “comrade”, is now 70 and his bones have begun to ache as he tends his garden.Time, however, has done nothing to diminish his affection and admiration for the middle-aged Pole who materialised at his redoubt almost half a century ago, an unexpected emissary from a habitually indifferent world.“Kapuściński was a born writer and he’s someone who’ll never be forgotten in Angola,” says Farrusco. “He knew what injustice was. He wasn’t just a journalist. Journalists sometimes do in-depth reporting from war zones but Kapuściński was a man of principle. I don’t have the words to describe exactly what his presence and personality meant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44bd1d9c91b2e5dab1910c1e7b64c180d0eb1f66/0_28_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=743171494008b84e992e109fb69c10ea","title":"spanish pm accuses catalan president of encouraging radicals","story":"Quim Torra tells Pedro Sánchez he will retract parliamentary support in absence of progressThe Catalan president, Quim Torra, has threatened to withdraw his crucial parliamentary support for Spain’s minority government unless it offers a new plan for regional independence by the end of the month.His ultimatum to Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish prime minister, came a day after protests to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s unilateral independence referendum ended with riot police charging towards demonstrators outside the regional parliament.Torra, a hardline nationalist who has been accused of stoking up the direct action that marred the commemoration, said the region’s patience “is not infinite” and called for a meeting as soon as possible.“If there is no agreed mechanism by November, then the pro-independence parties will no longer guarantee stability in the Spanish parliament to Mr Pedro Sánchez,” he told the Catalan parliament on Tuesday afternoon.Sánchez came into office through a vote of no confidence in the conservative administration of his predecessor, Mariano Rajoy. But to do so, he had to rely on the support of Basque and Catalan nationalists.As Sánchez’s Socialist Workers’ party has only 84 of the 350 seats in Spain’s parliament, it is reliant on smaller nationalist parties to pass the budget and other key parts of its legislative agenda.However, the Spanish government dismissed the threat on Tuesday evening. Its spokeswoman, the education minister, Isabel Celaá, told Torra that while negotiations on greater Catalan self-government remained on the table, the Sánchez administration would not be dictated to.“The president of the Catalan government doesn’t need to wait until November for our answer. We’ll give it to him right now,” she said.“The answer is self-government and not independence the proposal is coexistence and not independence. The Spanish government does not accept ultimatums and maintains its determination to carry on with the path of dialogue.”Celaá said Torra had made a mistake on Monday by “cheering on the radicals” as they scuffled with Catalan police, adding: “He’s making another mistake today by tossing around threats that only serve to damage the coexistence between Catalans.”About 180,000 people were estimated to have gathered in Barcelona on Monday to mark the anniversary of the referendum and show their support for Catalan independence. Many of them carried banners reading: “1 October, no forgiving, no forgetting.”However, the peaceful demonstrations were accompanied by the blocking of city streets, motorways and a high-speed rail line, and activists later attempted to surround the Catalan parliament and the Barcelona headquarters of the Spanish national police.Torra had praised those undertaking direct action, urging them to “keep up the pressure”.The Catalan police force, the Mossos d’Esquadra, said 30 of its officers were injured on Monday night as they tried to stop protesters forcing their way into the regional parliament and demonstrating outside the police HQ.Sánchez had urged Torra to rein in those responsible for the violence. “Catalan politics has to come back to the Catalan parliament,” he tweeted on Tuesday morning.“President Torra needs to fulfil his obligations and not jeopardise the political return to normality by encouraging radicals to besiege the institutions that represent all Catalans. Violence is not the answer.”The scenes of unrest will be damaging for the Catalan independence movement, which has always prided itself on being peaceful and democratic – even in the face of the violence used by Spanish police to prevent the referendum.But with the movement increasingly ided and political progress limited, its radical sectors are growing impatient at their leaders’ failure to deliver the republic they promised, and some have called for Torra to resign.The former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium after the Spanish government sacked him and his cabinet for staging the referendum, was among the first to criticise the masked activists who had tried to enter parliament.“If they’re wearing hoods, they aren’t 1 October people,” he tweeted. “If they use violence, they aren’t 1 October people. We did it with our faces uncovered and in a peaceful way. That is how, a year ago, we overcame an authoritarian state.”Puigdemont’s former vice-president Oriol Junqueras – who has been in custody awaiting trial for almost a year – also called on pro-independence Catalans to remain peaceful in their protests.“The 1 October taught us that truncheons and blows are always the worst solution and cannot be our way,” he wrote on Twitter. “We still have open wounds, we are people of peace and ours is, and always has been, a peaceful movement.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3649543.1538511326!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coveney admits he has tough time at cabinet making case for more overseas aid","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney  said it would “probably be more popular politically” to spend overseas aid money on domestic needs. Photograph: Tom Honan Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has admitted he has a “tough time” at Cabinet when making the case for increased overseas development aid. Speaking at the launch of the 2017 Irish Aid annual report on Tuesday evening, Mr Coveney said Ireland had made commitments to raise its aid budget, but it remained a difficult issue in the context of investment needs at home, particularly with next week’s budget looming.“We have an economy that is certainly roaring forward but we also have in many ways 10 years of under-investment in many areas domestically at home. Whether that’s healthcare provision or housing in particular,” he said. “And so it’s a pretty tough time to be making the case around the Cabinet table to be spending significantly more money on aid.“In order to make those choices when we could be spending the money domestically - and let’s be honest, probably be more popular politically - we do need to make the case to the public as to why this is necessary. Why this actually represents the kind of people we are.” Irish expenditure on Official Development Assistance (ODA) increased last year by about €17 million to €743.4 million. That represents about 0.3 per cent of GDP, the lowest proportion since 2000 but the highest overall spend since 2008. The majority of that goes to multilateral aid organisations, followed by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), with the greatest proportion of expenditure on humanitarian assistance. Last year, Ireland contributed €1.4 million to the crisis in Myanmar which has led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims to refugee camps in neighbouring countries. The budget has also helped responses to famine in South Sudan, Yemen, Somalia and Nigeria. Mr Coveney also said the effectiveness of the United Nations as a platform for negotiation and compromise can no longer be taken for granted.He recently raised the need to broker a peace deal in the Middle East during a speech to the UN general assembly. While he did not mention that particular issue at the launch of the 2017 Irish Aid annual report on Tuesday evening, he did raise general concerns about the ability of the UN to deal with international affairs. “Believe me, and I hate saying it, we can no longer take multilateralism for granted,” he said. “We can no longer take the effectiveness of the UN as an impartial intermediary and a platform for sensible debate and negotiation and compromise for granted any longer.”During his time in New York, the Foreign Affairs Minister also met with representatives of about 30 countries, hoping to garner support for Ireland’s bid to secure a rotating seat on the UN Security Council in 2021-2022. Speaking at the Irish Aid report launch in Dublin, he said the visit had reminded him of the role small countries like Ireland must play in safeguarding multilateralism. “And so countries that survive on the back of an international rules based order, and grow and influence as small countries on the back of the strength of argument that we have, as opposed to the strength of our military or our economy we need to speak up right now,” he said. “And I tried to do that in New York last week, in a way that I hope wasn’t offensive to anybody but in a way that I think needs to be said. And hopefully others will be encouraged to do the same.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648914.1538485514!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"foster very wrong on belfast agreement remarks flanagan says","story":"Speaking in the Dáil, the Taoiseach has said that the Good Friday Agreement is not up for negotiation in response to comments made by DUP leader Arlene Foster.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin has accused the DUP of showing a reckless disregard for the Good Friday Agreement. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe .Sinn Féin has accused the DUP of showing a reckless disregard for the Good Friday Agreement after leader Arlene Foster claimed the peace deal was not sacrosanct.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald insisted the 1998 accord between the UK and Ireland must not become a bargaining chip in the Brexit negotiations.She reacted angrily after Mrs Foster suggested the terms of the agreement could be altered in efforts to strike an EU exit deal.“Today’s comments by DUP leader Arlene Foster on the Good Friday Agreement are unacceptable and reveal a reckless disregard for the peace process, prosperity and progress,” said Ms McDonald.Critics of Brexit have warned of its potential to undermine aspects of the international treaty, including its provisions for cross-border co-operation and rights protections.The DUP campaigned against the Belfast Agreement when it was resoundingly endorsed in referenda on both sides of the Border in 1998.Elements of the deal have been altered by subsequent political agreements in Northern Ireland, such as the 2006 St Andrews Agreement.In an interview with the Daily , Mrs Foster said: “It has been deeply frustrating to hear people who voted Remain and in Europe talk about Northern Ireland as though we can’t touch the Belfast Agreement. Things evolve, even in the EU context.“There has been a lot of misinterpretation, holding it up as a sacrosanct piece of legislation.”In response, Ms McDonald called on the Government to make clear that the terms of the deal would be protected.“It should be remembered that Arlene Foster left the UUP, which supported the Good Friday Agreement, to join the anti-agreement DUP,” she added.“It appears the DUP leader has learnt nothing over the past 15 years.”The latest row between the DUP and Sinn Fein comes amid the ongoing political impasse in Northern Ireland following the collapse of the powersharing institutions in early 2017.“The Good Friday Agreement was endorsed by the vast majority of people north and south,” said the Sinn Fein president.“It is the people’s agreement and not a chip to be bargained with as part of any ToryDUP Brexit deal.“Brexit is incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement. The actions of the DUP and their deal with the Tories is bad for our economy and undermines the rights of citizens.“The DUP should commit to the full implementation of the Good Friday, and other agreements, rather than seeking to undermine them.“This would unlock the pathway to re-establishing the political institutions and safeguarding the interests of all the people in the north.”The Good Friday Agreement (also known as the Belfast Agreement) enshrines the “consent principle” that Northern Ireland’s position within the UK can only change if a majority of the region’s citizens vote for it.Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann claimed Mrs Foster’s comments potentially undermined that principle.“Arlene Foster’s comments on the Belfast Agreement are strategically shortsighted,” he said.“The DUP may have been happy to corrupt the 1998 agreement for their owns ends at St Andrews, but I cannot believe the DUP leader has been so careless as to throw it open in such a haphazard way which is of no benefit to unionism.“The reality is that the principle of consent is what binds us to the United Kingdom, it is the best settlement for unionists and should be sacrosanct.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3649325.1538509324!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"president to take part in three debates before polling day","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins and his wife Sabina  on Grafton Street. Photograph: Cyril Byrne President Michael D Higgins has described as “outrageous” media reports that he used part of a €317,000 allowance to “top up” the pay of a special adviser. Mr Higgins said the claim, made in a Sunday newspaper, was slanderous and hurtful to the inidual involved. “I just want to say I found the suggestion that it was used for anything other than what the Act specified absolutely outrageous. The suggestion that I used it to top up an employee’s salary, that was simply wrong and it was not true,” he said. He added: “I was really hurt for a member of my staff who was very unfairly treated and suggested that he had somehow or another benefited. “That was an outrageous slanderous comment to make.”He again maintained the allowance was spent only for the purposes for which it was intended – largely to host events at Áras an Uachtaráin – and that there would be a balance of unspent monies from this allowance which he would return to the exchequer at the end of his seven-year term.“At the end of the period, the month of November, we will make a full return. Everything is receipted. There is a statement. There is stock-taking in relation to the kitchen.“In exactly the same way at the end of the first term, I will be sending the balance straight back to the exchequer.”He continued: “I can say that every single euro has been properly spent and every single euro will be accounted for.”He said he would be open to a new mechanism to show spending in future but insisted he had done nothing differently from any of his predecessors. The President was speaking during a walkabout of Grafton Street on Wednesday afternoon. He also disclosed that he would participate in three broadcast debates between now and polling day on October 26th. They will be Saturday with Cormac Ó hEadhra, RTÉ Radio 1, on Saturday, October 13th a debate with Pat Kenny on Virgin Media 1 on Wednesday, October 17th and a PrimeTime debate on RTÉ 1 on Tuesday, October 23rd.Mr Higgins also said he and the secretary general to the presidency, Art O’Leary, had sat down in July to confirm which presidential events he would attend during the course of the campaign. He said he had not reduced the number of events but had not agreed to new requests once he had decided to announce his candidacy.“There are constraints on what I can do. There are also obligations. “I intend to honour every obligation I made some time ago. We are not accepting new ones. Those that are on the diary at the moment came out of discussion with the secretary general of the president’s office and myself. “They will stay. I will honour all of this.”He confirmed that no new events were included from July but also said he had not reduced the number of public engagements. Asked about DUP leader Arlene Foster’s comments that the Good Friday Agreement could be amended, Mr Higgins said the agreement was an important base for rights that could be availed of by all communities across Ireland. Asked to gauge the mood of the country at present, he said in 2011 there was a sense that there were “many people with disappointed expectations and many people in great distress”. “One of the innovations was on State visits I would give a substantive address,” he said, saying that led to the series of speeches he made critiquing the economic model. He said matters had improved since then but there were still great challenges, saying he had taken the opportunity of addressing the issues of equality, and the country was currently concerned about what was happening in housing. “There is a debate about whether or not housing can be resolved by the market or not,” he said, adding that he would address this issue within the limits of his office.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648169.1538423428!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joan freeman a long ago love a loan and the lack of a helicopter","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenator Joan Freeman launching her presidential campaign to questions about Des Walsh, the LA businessman who  contributed €120,000 to her cause.    Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsIt panned out more like the final scenes of a Barbara Cartland novel than the launch of a presidential campaign. If you read the blurb it goes something like this: A generous loan from a mystery businessman reveals a chance encounter with a long lost love in the shade of a gigantic pyramid.The launch of her official campaign on Monday saw Joan Freeman being bombarded with questions about Des Walsh, the Los Angeles businessman who had contributed €120,000 to her cause by way of a loan.As she recounted at her launch, and earlier to Seán O’Rourke on RTÉ, it had little to do with boring politics, rather a grand romance.For as it happened, she went out with Des Walsh when she was 19 in 1970s Dublin.“So we broke up after less than a year. Des went his way, I went my way. Seemingly what happened was Des moved to America, moved to I think Texas, and then moved to LA.“And after 40 years, he sent me an email. We spoke on the phone.”When asked had she conducted background checks on him, or done due diligence, her response came straight out of the Mills and Boons political playbook.“The fundamental question – sorry I might seem very shallow – what does he look like 40 years later? Is he married? Does he have children? Where does he live?”Despite the persistent efforts of reporters to change the literary genre from romance to hard-boiled, Freeman was not taking the bait.“No I didn’t need to do a background check on him. This guy is a very good guy.”Walsh used to be the president of a huge dietary supplement company called Herbalife which escaped being designated a “pyramid scheme” in 2016 but only after paying a fine of $200 million.In a clear case of rose-tinted ocularitis, Freeman could see no conflict, or no wrong. Walsh had made the contribution in his personal capacity and was now retired from the company. Besides, there had been no “criminal activity” by the company.“Just the way he remembers me from 40 years ago, he believes in what I’m doing. It is a loan,” she said.Freeman has a point in saying that Ireland is becoming like Trump’s America, where only the very rich, or those backed by the resources of a party, can become a candidate for president.She pointed out she will be paying the loan back at 9 per cent interest for five years, or possibly for 10. And she is the only one of the candidates who hasn’t a campaign bus, or, indeed, a campaign helicopter.Freeman arrived to her launch wearing a dress of royal purple with flared sleeves, a colour very reminiscent of Mary McAleese during her campaign in 1997.She outlined a number of interesting initiatives including extending the president’s An Gaisce awards to all age groups, having a national day of wellbeing, clamping down on cyber bullying and valuing our ageing population.The location was the City Assembly House, an eye-catching Georgian building in the city centre. And as is the wont of presidential launches this year, the room always seem too small for the scrum of media and supporters.Freeman talked about the hidden powers and the symbolic powers of the president that can mobilise communities across the country.That said, she is by far the richest when it comes to the timbre of voice and her ability not to get riled by questions. She sounds so like her sister Theresa Lowe, the former RTÉ presenter.

Photograph: Collins“I’m very proud of my time in Fianna Fáil, I joined Fianna Fáil when I was 21,” Mr Gallagher said.Mr Gallagher said the amount he had fundraised for Fianna Fáil was “in the region of €5,000 to €10,000 over a lifetime”.Asked about ‘tweetgate’, the moment on the RTÉ Frontline programme centred on the use of a tweet which claimed falsely to come from an official Twitter account of Martin McGuinness, the late Sinn Féin politician who was also running for the presidency, Mr Gallagher said: “I’ve shaken hands with RTÉ, we’ve put it behind us”. The tweet said a man who claimed to have given a cheque to Mr Gallagher for a Fianna Fáil fundraiser would be presented at a press conference the following day.The incident RTÉ Frontline programme was regarded as a turning point in the campaign. Mr Gallagher subsequently lost a commanding lead in the polls and then the election. Asked if his response to the tweet during the debate in 2011 cost him the election, Mr Gallagher responded: “I would leave that to much more experienced and wiser commentators, but there were lessons to be learned for me. It wasn’t my greatest performance in the end and there were lessons also for RTÉ.”After the election he took a case against RTÉ which, after six years, saw him win an apology and damages.“I accepted RTÉ’s apology, we had the fight for the six years and I’m happy that’s done”. He also clarified recent comments he made in which he appeared to compare his legal battle with RTÉ to the experience some victims of clerical abuse suffered at the hands of the Catholic Church. “The point I was trying to make, I wouldn’t compare my situation, anyone sitting at home who has ever taken on a ‘David and Goliath’ fight against an institution, the only point I was making is that big institutions do what they do, they lock down, double down, become defensive and ultimately, eventually will put their hands up.“If they would put their hands up early then it would save everybody time, money and resources, eventually just accept it. Sometimes by being defensive you further compound the very issue that set it all in train, that was the point I was making.”He also denied he had any part in recent leaks to newspapers relating to ‘tweetgate’, saying as far as he was concerned, he had moved on. He added he “saluted” the person he described as a whistleblower. “My focus now is not on 2011, it’s on 2018.”Asked about his low public profile during the seven years since the last presidential election in 2011, Mr Gallagher said it had taken him around 18 months to recover from the campaign.“It was not because of losing the election. The first challenge was because I had stepped away from my businesses, I was starting again, that took some time. I had two children, that changes perspective,” he said.“I started a new business, continued to do what I committed to do, what I had outlined in 2011, in terms of my commitment to jobs, to SMEs, to trying to help inspire the next generation of business leaders.”When asked about DUP leader Arlene Foster’s contention that the Belfast Agreement could be changed to accommodate a final Brexit deal, Mr Gallagher said the Brexit discussions were at a sensitive stage.He said it was important that all six candidates in the presidential race to be careful with their comments.Instead of commenting on Ms Fosters view, Mr Gallagher said there should be a return to the work commenced by former president Mary McAleese and her husband Martin in establishing cross-community contacts, relationships and trust.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA Wire The Belfast Agreement is not up for negotiation in the Brexit talks, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Mr Varadkar told the Dáil that the Government would stand by and defend the primacy of the agreement.“We see the Government as being co-defenders of that agreement,” he said.“And certainly as far as this Government is concerned the Good Friday Agreement is not up for negotiation in these talks over Brexit.”The Taoiseach was responding to Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald who raised the issue following the publication of a newspaper interview in which DUP leader Arlene Foster said the Belfast Agreement was not sacrosanct and could be changed to facilitate a Brexit deal.Ms Foster had expressed deep frustration with EU officials and those in favour of the UK remaining in the union, who repeatedly stated that the Belfast Agreement could not be touched.Ms McDonald said: “The DUP rejected the Good Friday Agreement. They embrace Brexit and on both counts they act in defiance of the wishes of the people in the North.”She said “the Good Friday Agreement is not up for renegotiation as part of Brexit and it is sacrosanct”.She also accused the DUP of “play-acting” and playing to extremists.Mr Varadkar said he had worked very well with Ms Foster when they both had responsibility for tourism in their respective jurisdictions.“We should all respect the Good Friday Agreement and we should all work as hard as we can to ensure those institutions are back up and running again.”But he said the agreement “is not a piece of British legislation. It is an international agreement between the British and Irish governments as well as a multi-party agreement among the various parties.“And it was an agreement that was put to referendum, adopted with over 70 per cent support in Northern Ireland and over 90 per cent in this State”.He said: “It could only be changed with the agreement of the British and Irish Governments and it could only be changed with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland and indeed cross-community agreement at that.”Ms Foster, speaking to the Daily , had said the Belfast Agreement should not be considered untouchable in Brexit negotiations.She said: “It has been deeply frustrating to hear people who voted Remain and in Europe talk about Northern Ireland as though we can’t touch the Belfast Agreement.“Things evolve, even in the EU context.”Mrs Foster also said she wanted to see more focus on the positives of Brexit.“I think the reason why so many people are turned off by Brexit is because they are being fed a diet of negativity - whether it’s infighting, Brussels, being disrespected by people over there.Mrs Foster was speaking ahead of the Tory party conference where Boris Johnson will use his speech to issue a clarion call to activists to “believe in Conservative values”.In what will undoubtedly be seen as a pitch to replace Theresa May as leader, Mr Johnson will not only restate his opposition to the prime minister’s handling of Brexit but call on Tories to focus on law and order, tax cuts and house-building in order to defeat Labour.As Mrs May celebrated her 62nd birthday, Mr Johnson was pictured jogging through a field near his Oxfordshire home, in a photo apparently designed to mock the prime minister’s famous memories of “running through wheatfields” as a mischievous schoolgirl.Mrs Foster praised Mr Johnson’s “belief” and “spirit” and said she’d be happy to work with him as prime minister.“People want hope, they want to be positive,” Mrs Foster told the newspaper.She also said she would look at any new offer to the European Union on the Irish border, but Northern Ireland must leave on the same terms as rest of Britain.It was separately reported on Monday British Prime Minister Theresa May said she is preparing to make a new offer on the border aimed at breaking the deadlock in the Brexit negotiations.“We should wait to see what the text actually says in relation to any offer that has been made to the European Union,” Ms Foster said.“We always said that we have just the one red line - we cannot be separated from the rest of the United Kingdom, from a constitutional position and also from an economic reason as well.”Meanwhile, the DUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson said fixation on the Irish backstop is getting in the way of a deal that would be good for everyone.If people stopped being so pessimistic and put half as much effort into entering a trade agreement between the UK and the EU “then we would all be better off,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.Responding to Mrs Foster’s remarks saying she could work with Boris Johnson if he became UK prime minister, Mr Donaldson said she had said there was “a lot of solidity in what he said,” but that did not necessarily mean she supports him.It all depends on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, if there is a no deal scenario, then there will have to be a change in how northsouth institutions operate, he said.Mr Donaldson said he wants to see the Belfast Agreement continue. Ms Foster had been reflecting the reality of what could happen in a ‘no deal’ scenario.“We would be deluding ourselves if we think that (no deal) would not change the way we do business.”He gave the example of the single market for the island of Ireland. If there is a no deal outcome then that will have implications and adjustments will have to be made.In response to a Times of London report that Mrs May will put forward new proposals on the backstop which would involve the UK remaining tied to the EU’s customs rule book beyond the two-year transition, and until a mutually acceptable technological solution on the Irish Border could be found, Mr Donaldson said that such a proposal had not been put to the DUP.“It is a speech from one paper. We are meeting the prime minister this afternoon, let’s see what she has to say today. But it’s not just a matter for the prime minister, it is for the EU and the Irish Government too.” – Additional reporting PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: EPA European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has reiterated to British prime minister Theresa May that there must be agreement on the Irish border if the UK wants a Brexit deal.Despite the rejection of key elements of Mrs May’s Chequers blueprint for Brexit at last month’s informal summit in Salzburg, Mr Juncker said the EU still wanted an agreement.However, addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg ahead of the next EU summit in Brussels later this month, he stressed the EU would not compromise on key principles.“We will have an interesting meeting as far as Brexit is concerned. We want to have a deal. Those who think a no-deal would be a better solution are not aware of the difficulties such a scenario would imply,” he said.“When it comes to the Border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, we are sticking to the point of view we have expressed so many times - Ireland first.”The summit on October 18th to 19th has been billed as the “moment of truth” when it will become clear whether it is possible for the two sides to do a deal.Mrs May has said the Government is working on new proposals to resolve the issue of the Irish Border - ensuring there is no need for the return of “hard border” controls - although it is unclear whether they will be ready in time for the Brussels meeting.The parliament also heard renewed criticism of foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt over his comparison of the EU to the former Soviet Union. Manfred Weber, the leader of the main centre right grouping in the parliament, said Mr Hunt needed to apologise for his comments.“Now we experience a new level of populism when the foreign minister of Great Britain, Hunt, is comparing the European Union with the Soviet Union,” he said.He quoted Polish former foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski who said: “Please Mr Hunt, show us the gulag, please Mr Hunt show us the Soviet Union army troops in your country, please show us the Stasi system in your country.”He added: “So Sikorski is right. Mr Hunt, you should apologise for what you have said.”Mr Hunt’s comments were welcomed by former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who said the foreign secretary had been echoing a view he had expressed for years.“For a decade here I have noticed that that centralising authoritarian tone began to sound very much like the old Soviet Union,” he told the parliament.“To see the British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt now using that language means we have shifted the centre of gravity, we have shifted this debate.”The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MEP Diane Dodds - whose party props up Mrs May’s Government at Westminster - warned they would never accept the “impossible demands” of the EU for a “backstop” which would see the imposition of customs controls between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK if the two sides failed to reach a wider agreement on trade.“The idea, as proposed in the backstop, that we would allow Northern Ireland to become some sort of semi-detached part of the United Kingdom is both offensive and outrageous,” she said.“Protecting the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom is a red line that cannot be broken or bent.“When it comes to the stability of the United Kingdom and the security of Northern Ireland’s place in it - mark my words, we are not bluffing.” - PA Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The BBC was approached because they have a special relationship with Buckingham Palace and a formula that works.But they turned it down because they don’t think enough people will tune in and that there isn’t enough support for the Yorks.Instead, the BBC said clips from the service will appear across news services throughout the day.Sky said it will show the highlights, but will not broadcast the wedding live.ITV will also broadcast a 30-minute highlights programme, The Royal Wedding: A Family Celebration, at 8pm the same evening.The BBC broadcast the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s wedding Princess Eugenie and Mr Brooksbank, a brand ambassador for a tequila company, met through mutual friends while skiing in Verbier 2010.Their engagement was announced earlier this year.Around 850 guests have been invited to the October 12 wedding, with 1,200 members of the public invited to stand in the Windsor Palace grounds.The couple are thought to have invited several celebrities, including model Cara Delevingne and singer Ellie Goulding. George Clooney, who owns Casamigos Tequila, the copany that Mr rooksbank works for, could also attend, with his wife Amal.After the ceremony, the newlyweds will undertake a carriage ride through Windsor. The route will not include the Long Walk, tactfully avoiding any visual comparison between the number of admirers who turn out to celebrate their day with the crowds who lined the streets for Prince Harry on May 19.Princess Eugenie and Jack BrooksbankPlease review our commenting policyThe Great British Bake Off 2018: pastry week - inedible delicacies, favourites fall and a dark horse returnsOlympic gold medalist Amy Williams moved into a bungalow after sport left her body brokenThis Morning: 30 Unforgettable Years, review – a fitting tribute to the show that changed daytime TVComment: We must protect the \u0026#39offensive\u0026#39 ritual of clapping from the jazz-handing snowflakesUS halts visas for same-sex partners of diplomatsIndonesian earthquake aid workers \u0026#39too scared to go on\u0026#39 as night falls in devastated townArmy reviews beard ban amid fears rule is putting off younger generation of potential recruits Austria ridiculed for plan to ban \u0026#39extremist\u0026#39 hand signals, including one identical to Churchill\u0026#39s \u0026#39V for Victory\u0026#39Michael Gove suggests Government could launch crackdown on disposable nappies - but rules out banHow Boris Johnson won over Tory faithful with his uncompromising call to \u0026#39chuck Chequers\u0026#39One of France\u0026#39s top wine chateaus embroiled in inquiry into \u0026#39rigged\u0026#39 St Emilion rankingsAmerican couple lose appeal to keep Pissarro painting looted by NazisArlene Foster torpedoes Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit compromise as she warns new regulatory checks in Irish Sea are a \u0026#39complete non-starter\u0026#39Knifeman arrested after stabbing at London Overground stationMelania Trump embarks on solo tour of Africa, visiting programmes funded by US aid that President wants to cutStreet Fascism: an excerpt from The Secret Life of Bill Clinton by Ambrose Evans-PritchardBoris Johnson warns the Conservatives will be \u0026#39punished\u0026#39 for Chequers at the polls as he urges Theresa May to \u0026#39chuck\u0026#39 her planBryony Kimmings interview: \u0026#39An audience member bit a chunk out of my leg – but motherhood was worse\u0026#39Foster mystery: a key witness ignored by the FBI reveals the face of a possible murdererWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/16/11/football-live-streaming-premier-league.jpg  width= 2027  height= 1145  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/16/11/football-live-streaming-premier-league.jpg","title":"beoutq football live stream network saudi arabia bein media piracy","story":"Created with Sketch.Join us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsThe beoutQ\u0026nbspnetwork has been illegally live streaming Premier League football games and Formula One races on an industrial scaleClick to followThe Independent TechA Qatar-based sports TV network is seeking $1 billion in damages from Saudi Arabia for the kingdom\u0027s alleged involvement in the most widespread piracy of sports broadcasting that the world has ever seen.BeIN\u0026nbspCorporation claims that the pirate network\u0026nbspbeoutQ\u0026nbsphas received State support in order to grow into an advanced piracy operation that serves content to potentially millions of viewers through illegal set-top boxes.Global sporting events have been broadcast through the beoutQ\u0026nbspnetwork – including the 2018 Fifa World Cup, the Formula One World Championship and the Premier League – after the pirate nework hijacked the feeds of legitimate broadcasters.Piracy is a major problem facing the sports and broadcasting industries. By supporting beoutQ\u0027s widespread and notorious infringement of the intellectual property rights of beIN and its partners, Saudi Arabia is setting a dangerous new precedent, said David Roney, a lawyer at Sidley Austin LLP who is leading the arbitration on behalf of beIN.\u0026nbspBeIN will pursue all available legal remedies to protect its rights and secure full compensation.BeIN also claims that Saudi Arabia has initiated a series of abusive measures aimed at forcing the Qatari sports network out of the local broadcasting market and destroying the value of beIN\u0027s investments in the country.This includes allegedly banning the importation and distribution of beIN set-top boxes and blocking access to beIN\u0027s websites and call centre.The alleged measures stem from a diplomatic dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which has resulted in a trade boycott of the tiny gulf state.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

Under current rules they must be paid a minimum salary of £30,000 - a figure Mr Javid hinted could be reviewed.Azad Azam, managing director of building firm\u0026nbspDPB Ltd in East London, said he was stunned by the government’s stance, which currently classes all building trades as low-skilled.Robot bricklayers to be deployed in Brexit BritainThree in five UK firms say it\u0027s getting harder to find skilled staffFirms face Brexit skills shortage, forcing up wages in some sectorsImmigrants face new \u0027British values test\u0027 to become UK citizensImmigration myths that fuelled Brexit blown apart by major reportImmigration has made the UK more productive and prosperousAbbott to dismiss ‘arbitrary’ immigration targets in major speech“We have not met the house building target for 12 years in this country and that’s with free movement of workers,” he said.Four in 10 of the staff he employs are from the EU, including many from Romania and Poland.\u0026nbsp“We were shocked when we heard the plans. I thought that, with housing supposedly being a top priority, there would be an exception for construction workers.”Mr Azam says he has a contract in the pipeline to build 300 houses near Walsall but if immigration is significantly reduced he simply will not be able to fulfil it.\u0026nbsp“It will set us back 10 years. It is bad for every construction business in this country.”A number of workers he employed from Romania have already had enough of the uncertainty over their future in the UK and have left to go and work in Spain.Finding British construction workers to replace them is hard, says Azam, whose father settled in the UK in the 1960s after moving here from Pakistan.“Work that many Asians were brought over here to do, like my dad in a steelworks in Sheffield - that kind of physical labour is now being done by EU migrants. It’s frowned upon by British workers. They don’t want to do it.”He advertised for an apprentice for four months in the UK and received just three applications. One young staff member he did take on left after just one day, saying, “It wasn’t for me.”It will set us back 10 years. It is bad for every construction business in this country.To make matters worse, the visa system soon to apply to all migrant workers under the government’s proposals is a “nightmare”, and will put firms off finding the skills they need, Azam says.He recently hired two highly specialised stonemasons from India. it took him more than six months to get the relevant permits, just for a three-month project.“If that is the system for all EU migrants as well it just won’t work. By the time I apply they will have found work in other countries.”Mr Azam said that while the approach would mean the country had no chance of hitting its house-building target, he was more concerned about a drastic skills shortage in the health and social care - another area the government has pledged fix.The social care system is strained by funding cuts and an ageing population but the Nuffield Trust said the planned approach to immigration would cause further damage.Helen Buckingham, Nuffield Trust’s director of strategy, said social care providers are already turning away hundreds of thousands people who would once have been considered in need of help.\u0026nbsp“If we cut off lower paid EU workers without putting in enough money to make social care a sector people in the UK want to work in, more and more people who really need help with the everyday tasks of life will find nowhere to go,” she said.“Either we address the financial crisis that has pushed social care providers too far into the red to pay decent wages, or we continue to allow migration to fill these gaps after Brexit.”It is not only companies hiring low-skilled roles that are being hit by falling immigration.\u0026nbspTobi Schneidler, co-founder of Bouncepad, which supplies secure enclosures for iPads and tablets, said the lack of clarity around immigration had stifled hiring and that he found the government’s approach “extremely frustrating”.“Uncertainty for businesses is the most poisonous of conditions,” he said, adding that several EU citizens he knew had returned to their home countries because the “atmosphere has soured” since the referendum vote.His own experience of applying for British citizenship has also been time-consuming and costly.Despite having first moved to the UK from Germany 26 years ago, he had to pay £5,000 in legal fees, completed an 80-page application form and pass the British citizenship test.“I’ve lived in the UK and paid taxes here for years, which must have been registered at HMRC, but I had to provide proof of a stable income, which entrepreneurs do not always have.\u0026nbspFemi Oluwole confronts a Brexiteer claiming the EU forces uncontrolled and harmful immigration on the United KingdomHospitality, which employs around 7 per cent of the UK workforce, is another area in which immigration policy is on a collision course with economic reality.The government has touted the sector as a potential winner from Brexit. Thanks to the weakened pound, holidays here are cheaper for overseas visitors. But many hotel, bar and kitchen staff will also be considered low-skilled, and millions of them are from the EU, leaving businesses short of staff.Neil Pattison, director of Caterer, a hospitality jobs board, said his customers have already noticed a drop-off in applications while his site has a higher number of open job adverts.“The competition for talent is already fierce, and a further reduction in migrant labour from the EU will likely push this to a critical level,” he said.“Should the proposed immigration policy progress, the talent pool in the sector would of course significantly decrease, particularly for the volumes of entry level roles in the sector that are essential for the smooth running of any hospitality business.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Under current rules they must be paid a minimum salary of £30,000 - a figure Mr Javid hinted could be reviewed.Azad Azam, managing director of building firm\u0026nbspDPB Ltd in East London, said he was stunned by the government’s stance, which currently classes all building trades as low-skilled.Robot bricklayers to be deployed in Brexit BritainThree in five UK firms say it\u0027s getting harder to find skilled staffFirms face Brexit skills shortage, forcing up wages in some sectorsImmigrants face new \u0027British values test\u0027 to become UK citizensImmigration myths that fuelled Brexit blown apart by major reportImmigration has made the UK more productive and prosperousAbbott to dismiss ‘arbitrary’ immigration targets in major speech“We have not met the house building target for 12 years in this country and that’s with free movement of workers,” he said.Four in 10 of the staff he employs are from the EU, including many from Romania and Poland.\u0026nbsp“We were shocked when we heard the plans. I thought that, with housing supposedly being a top priority, there would be an exception for construction workers.”Mr Azam says he has a contract in the pipeline to build 300 houses near Walsall but if immigration is significantly reduced he simply will not be able to fulfil it.\u0026nbsp“It will set us back 10 years. It is bad for every construction business in this country.”A number of workers he employed from Romania have already had enough of the uncertainty over their future in the UK and have left to go and work in Spain.Finding British construction workers to replace them is hard, says Azam, whose father settled in the UK in the 1960s after moving here from Pakistan.“Work that many Asians were brought over here to do, like my dad in a steelworks in Sheffield - that kind of physical labour is now being done by EU migrants. It’s frowned upon by British workers. They don’t want to do it.”He advertised for an apprentice for four months in the UK and received just three applications. One young staff member he did take on left after just one day, saying, “It wasn’t for me.”It will set us back 10 years. It is bad for every construction business in this country.To make matters worse, the visa system soon to apply to all migrant workers under the government’s proposals is a “nightmare”, and will put firms off finding the skills they need, Azam says.He recently hired two highly specialised stonemasons from India. it took him more than six months to get the relevant permits, just for a three-month project.“If that is the system for all EU migrants as well it just won’t work. By the time I apply they will have found work in other countries.”Mr Azam said that while the approach would mean the country had no chance of hitting its house-building target, he was more concerned about a drastic skills shortage in the health and social care - another area the government has pledged fix.The social care system is strained by funding cuts and an ageing population but the Nuffield Trust said the planned approach to immigration would cause further damage.Helen Buckingham, Nuffield Trust’s director of strategy, said social care providers are already turning away hundreds of thousands people who would once have been considered in need of help.\u0026nbsp“If we cut off lower paid EU workers without putting in enough money to make social care a sector people in the UK want to work in, more and more people who really need help with the everyday tasks of life will find nowhere to go,” she said.“Either we address the financial crisis that has pushed social care providers too far into the red to pay decent wages, or we continue to allow migration to fill these gaps after Brexit.”It is not only companies hiring low-skilled roles that are being hit by falling immigration.\u0026nbspTobi Schneidler, co-founder of Bouncepad, which supplies secure enclosures for iPads and tablets, said the lack of clarity around immigration had stifled hiring and that he found the government’s approach “extremely frustrating”.“Uncertainty for businesses is the most poisonous of conditions,” he said, adding that several EU citizens he knew had returned to their home countries because the “atmosphere has soured” since the referendum vote.His own experience of applying for British citizenship has also been time-consuming and costly.Despite having first moved to the UK from Germany 26 years ago, he had to pay £5,000 in legal fees, completed an 80-page application form and pass the British citizenship test.“I’ve lived in the UK and paid taxes here for years, which must have been registered at HMRC, but I had to provide proof of a stable income, which entrepreneurs do not always have.\u0026nbspFemi Oluwole confronts a Brexiteer claiming the EU forces uncontrolled and harmful immigration on the United KingdomHospitality, which employs around 7 per cent of the UK workforce, is another area in which immigration policy is on a collision course with economic reality.The government has touted the sector as a potential winner from Brexit. Thanks to the weakened pound, holidays here are cheaper for overseas visitors. But many hotel, bar and kitchen staff will also be considered low-skilled, and millions of them are from the EU, leaving businesses short of staff.Neil Pattison, director of Caterer, a hospitality jobs board, said his customers have already noticed a drop-off in applications while his site has a higher number of open job adverts.“The competition for talent is already fierce, and a further reduction in migrant labour from the EU will likely push this to a critical level,” he said.“Should the proposed immigration policy progress, the talent pool in the sector would of course significantly decrease, particularly for the volumes of entry level roles in the sector that are essential for the smooth running of any hospitality business.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The company offered no further details.\u0026nbspThe discount sports giant paid £90m for the troubled high street group, picking up all its UK stores, branding and stock. Mr Ashley said he planned to keep 80 per cent of House of Fraser outlets open, and outlined ambitions to turn the brand into the “Harrods of the high street”.However, last month it emerged that stores in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon were set to shut, with Mr Ashley blaming “greedy landlords”\u0026nbspfor “refusing to be reasonable”. The retail tycoon, who also owns Newcastle United, has come under fire from property groups for his approach to rent negotiations with landlords. Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, said: “What has been taking place is negotiations between House of Fraser and its landlords – a two-party process – where each party will have its own interests and one party simply can’t cry ‘unfair’ in the media when it doesn’t get what it wants.”House of Fraser stores in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon face closureSports Direct should hug House of Fraser customers even if it’s priceyHouse of Fraser customers’ anger as gift cards no longer validMr Ashley has also faced criticism for his failure to address House of Fraser customers’ concerns, after\u0026nbspall online orders were cancelled and gift cards were made invalid. Meanwhile, a number of brands have been left out of pocket following the sale of House of Fraser, after administrators EY revealed that suppliers including Gucci, Prada and Ralph Lauren, would not be paid money owed to them, with some amounts running to millions of pounds. Mike Saul, Mulberry founder,\u0026nbspwarned that luxury brands would “think very hard” about continuing to deal with House of Fraser under its new ownership.

Solid is how we evolve the web in order to restore balance – by giving every one of us complete control over data, personal or not, in a revolutionary way.Applications developed through Solid may have a similar function and feel to familiar apps – such as chat apps,\u0026nbspvideo-sharing sites and music players –\u0026nbsphowever there is one key difference: All data that passes through them is under the control of the user.But while the decentralised platform aims to wrest power away from\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspgiants like Amazon, Facebook and Google, the effort will need to be huge to have any kind of impact.Facebook and Google now have direct influence over nearly three quarters of all internet traffic, thanks to the vast amounts of apps and services they own that\u0026nbspincludes YouTube, WhatsApp\u0026nbspand Instagram.\u0026nbspBerners-Lee, waves as he in introduced to the audience during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games (Getty Images)To realise this vision, Berners-Lee has founded a new company called Inrupt, which will provide the necessary infrastructure to support Solid.\u0026nbspHe will also be taking a sabbatical from MIT and his other projects in order to\u0026nbspdedicate his time to Solid and Inrupt.People want to have a web they can trust. People want apps that help them do what they want and need to do – without spying on them, he wrote.Apps that don\u0027t have an ulterior motive of distracting them with propositions to buy this or that. People will pay for this kind of quality and assurance... It is going to take a lot of effort to build the new Solid platform and drive broad adoption but I think we have enough energy to take the world to a new tipping point.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On Twitter, she added: Trust me it\u0027s worth the wait.Appearing on TMZ, West himself confirmed the delay, saying that he hoped to record in Africa later in the year. “It’s just a full Ye album, and those five albums that I dropped earlier were like superhero rehabilitation,” he said, referring to the five albums he produced and released earlier in the year.ORIGINAL: Considering how sporadic and temperamental West’s current behaviour appears to be, there’s no way anyone can know for sure whether he intends on still releasing the album or scrapping it all together.Delaying the album inevitably would not be an unprecedented move for West take, for instance, Turbo Grafx 16, a record he\u0026nbsppromised to release in the summer of 2016. The album never materialised, with fans having to wait until summer 2018 for West’s\u0026nbspThe Life of Pablo follow-up –\u0026nbspthe seven-track album ye.However, Turbo Grafx 16 never had an exact release date, unlike Yandhi which also has an album cover – a clear MiniDisk with purple tape on it, reminicent of the 2013 album cover for Yeezus. Fans\u0026nbspand music critics have speculated that West has delayed the album so it doesn\u0027t\u0026nbspcompete with Lil Wayne’s new record\u0026nbspTha Carter V, although a Tweet from West contested\u0026nbspthis.The Independent has reached out to West’s representatives in a hope of getting a new release date.What have we heard of Yandhi so far?Whether any previously released tracks will actually appear on the album remains to be seen. However, West has released a couple of\u0026nbsptracks over the last few weeks, including the aforementioned Lil Pump collaboration “I Love It” and the track “XTCY”.During his Saturday Night Live appearance he also performed “We Got Love” with Teyana Taylor, a track initially meant for her album K.T.S.E,\u0026nbspwhich was produced by West and released earlier this year.There’s also a snippet of a track available on Instagram. The nearly minute-long clip came alongside a message reading: “Yandhi is releasing this Saturday”.Who will feature on Yandhi?A variety of other artists are rumoured to appear on the record, including regular collaborators Kid Cudi, 070 Shake, Ty Dolla Sign and Young Thug.Perhaps the most controversial collaborators expected to appear on the record include\u0026nbsp6ix9ine and XXXTenacion, who West says recorded vocals before his untimely death earlier this year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And if you have been to so many countries in books, what could be more natural than to go and see them yourself?”BBC News unveiled the illustration of Matilda as poet laureate, “widely celebrated for her moving performance of The Trunchbull Saga”, as part of the anniversary celebrations on 1 October.Roald Dahl Story Company 2018)The\u0026nbspRoald\u0026nbspDahl Story Company had asked the British public what Matilda’s life would be like now, from her work to who she would be friends with in real life.JK Rowling’s new book is full of twists and turns, but it’s bloatedJake Gyllenhaal to play the villain in Spider-Man sequelRoald Dahl’s Matilda at 30: A heroine who changed livesSuggestions for her friends\u0026nbspincluded Emma Watson, Ed Sheeran, and the Duchess of Sussex.

So it\u0027s possible that you might spot part of the Orionids\u0026nbspany time from now until 7 November.Rare electric blue clouds captured on film by NasaAnd while 21 October marks the peak of the show, the Moon might mean you\u0027re more likely to see them the week before. Around the middle of the month, it will get out of the way in the sky and make it easier for the Orionids\u0026nbspto shine through.At their peak, the Orionids could see as many as 20 of the meteors streaking across the sky. That makes it a relatively muted meteor shower compared with some of the other annual displays, but it still should be visible for the ground.And what they might lack in quantity they can make up for in quantity: the Orionids are known in particular for the brilliance of some of their lights, making them especially easy to spot.As ever, astronomers recommend heading out to somewhere with relatively little light pollution so that the night sky is more visible. Find somewhere dark and allow your eyes to adjust before looking up into the sky – wherever you\u0027d like, and with no special equipment needed at all.In keeping with their name, the meteor shower\u0026nbspwill be most visible from famous constellation of\u0026nbspOrion. But in practise, you can look just about wherever you want – and some experts recommend looking up with friends, so that you can survey the entire sky at once.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They found that a mysterious planet of the kind previously suggested — a huge Super-Earth on a very wide orbit — fit with the way that their new find was moving through the solar system.The newly discovered object is called\u0026nbsp2015 TG387, is probably a small dwarf planet at just 300km across,\u0026nbspand is incredibly far away. It is currently lying\u0026nbspabout two and a half times further away from the Sun than Pluto is.There could be many more planets like Earth than we realisedIt often reaches much further away. Its orbit takes it\u0026nbspto about 2,300 AU — that is\u0026nbsp2,300 times as far away from the sun as we are, and vastly more than the already huge\u0026nbsp34 AU that the distant Pluto sits at.At that distance,\u0026nbsp2015 TG387\u0026nbspis one of the few known objects that is so far away that its orbit is not affected by even the giant planets in our solar system like Neptune and Jupiter.These so-called Inner Oort Cloud objects like 2015 TG387, 2012 VP113, and Sedna are isolated from most of the Solar System\u0027s known mass, which makes them immensely interesting, said Sheppard. They can be used as probes to understand what is happening at the edge of our Solar System.The object is one of the strangest things that astronomers have ever spotted within our own solar system. But there could be many more of them than we have ever realised, the researchers said.We think there could be thousands of small bodies like 2015 TG387 out on the Solar System\u0027s fringes, but their distance makes finding them very difficult, said the University of Hawaii\u0027s David Tholen. Currently we would only detect 2015 TG387 when it is near its closest approach to the Sun. For some 99 percent of its 40,000-year orbit, it would be too faint to see.The new discovery is being announced by\u0026nbspInternational Astronomical Union\u0027s Minor Planet Center. A paper with full details has been submitted to the\u0026nbspAstronomical Journal.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The company offered no further details.\u0026nbspThe discount sports giant paid £90m for the troubled high street group, picking up all its UK stores, branding and stock. Mr Ashley said he planned to keep 80 per cent of House of Fraser outlets open, and outlined ambitions to turn the brand into the “Harrods of the high street”.However, last month it emerged that stores in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon were set to shut, with Mr Ashley blaming “greedy landlords”\u0026nbspfor “refusing to be reasonable”. The retail tycoon, who also owns Newcastle United, has come under fire from property groups for his approach to rent negotiations with landlords. Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, said: “What has been taking place is negotiations between House of Fraser and its landlords – a two-party process – where each party will have its own interests and one party simply can’t cry ‘unfair’ in the media when it doesn’t get what it wants.”House of Fraser stores in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon face closureSports Direct should hug House of Fraser customers even if it’s priceyHouse of Fraser customers’ anger as gift cards no longer validMr Ashley has also faced criticism for his failure to address House of Fraser customers’ concerns, after\u0026nbspall online orders were cancelled and gift cards were made invalid. Meanwhile, a number of brands have been left out of pocket following the sale of House of Fraser, after administrators EY revealed that suppliers including Gucci, Prada and Ralph Lauren, would not be paid money owed to them, with some amounts running to millions of pounds. Mike Saul, Mulberry founder,\u0026nbspwarned that luxury brands would “think very hard” about continuing to deal with House of Fraser under its new ownership.

Speaking at the launch of the 14th series at London’s Soho Hotel, he said: “She caused her problems herself, I believe. She went a step too far.“She’s made her bed, she’s going to have to lie in it. It’s one of life’s lessons that she’s learned. Maybe it might be a wake-up call for her. She’s got to solve this and then move on.

He will solve the problem by building a bridge between the UK mainland and Ireland. Mr Boris Johnson is more known for burning bridges than for building bridges!We will never undermine the principles of the European project to rescue a political party who is not even capable to find a common line on the mess of Brexit“Then there’s Mr Rees-Mogg who’s saying ‘yeah, I have the proposals for the future of Brexit, ordinary citizens and their savings can be secure after Brexit!’ and in the meantime he’s opening for himself an investment fund in Ireland, to transfer his money to Ireland.”He added: “Jeremy Hunt, who is comparing the European Union with the Soviet Union. But in his case that is not so abnormal: he has once even confused Japan with China. This is not the first time this is happening.\u0026nbsp“The previous time he was insulting his wife, but this time it’s something far more different: he’s insulting not us, but millions of ordinary citizens who have lived under Soviet rule for so long. That is in fact a point on which he has to apologise, I think, because we cannot take it as such a thing he said.”Other senior Brussels politicians also used the debate to tear into senior Conservatives. Manfred Weber, leader of the centre-right European People’s Party and an ally of Angela Merkel, told MEPs that British politicians would have to start taking responsibility for their mistakes.“Brexit means leaving the European Union and this means losing the advantages of this Union. That is the simple principle behind this,” Mr Weber said.“The big challenge for the politicians in Great Britain like Hunt and Johnson is probably that after March next year they have to take over responsibility.\u0026nbsp“For the first time they have to explain to people what they did, what are the mistakes of their political engagement, and they can’t blame Brussels anymore for what is happening in Britain. That is a big change for them.”Mr Weber, a likely candidate to be the next president of the European Commission, also called for “ringfenced” protections for EU citizens living in Britain and British citizens living in the EU in the event of a no-deal.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

public to decide what they want us to do next\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsHeidi Allen has become the latest Conservative MP to back a Final Say Brexit referendum, arguing there is now “no alternative”.The prominent backbencher said that, with the Chequers proposals “dead” and the threat to jobs from crashing out of the EU without a deal, the decision had to be thrown back to the public.Ms Allen blamed Boris Johnson and other Tory right-wingers for killing off Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which now had no chance of approval at Westminster – even if it can be revived in Brussels.Clark insists ‘we need to have a Brexit deal’, contradicting May“They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands,” she said. “It is they who have made Chequers dead.”She then added: “That being the case, then I think that it is the end of the road, which is very disappointing and for me leaves us with no alternative.“Should we come to that and no deal ... then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.”Crucially, Ms Allen said the option of staying in the EU under existing terms would have to be on the ballot paper.She told BBC Radio 4 that she would still support in principle an “11th hour” deal hammered out by the prime minister but that it was now clear many in her party would not.Her comments came as the Conservative faithful gather in Birmingham for the party’s annual conference and after Mr Johnson’s latest broadside against the prime minister’s negotiating stance.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s

Boris Johnson will draw a big crowd for his “Chuck Chequers” rally.But there is a bigger danger waiting in the wings for the Tories: They simply don’t have a domestic agenda big enough for the moment.Labour has, over the past few days, set out its vision for Britain. It is, in places, scary. But give Jeremy Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell this, it is undoubtedly clear and bold. As one Cabinet minister says, half admiringly:  “They’re hungry.”The Tories need to show  they have a better plan, one that will deal with people’s concerns— and they don’t have any time to waste. As one minister warns: “I’m just really terried. People don’t realise what a big deal this is.”The Tory Party’s problem is that it isn’t giving the country a vision of where it wants to take it. One former party leader has taken to lamenting that the Tories have “lost the narrative”.At conference last year, Theresa May declared that it was her mission to solve the housing crisis, to restore the British dream of home ownership for the many.But in the past  months, the Government has made far too little progress on this. Yes, some sensible steps have been taken. But the policies that will really solve this crisis, proper planning reform and a massive, Government-led housebuilding programme, haven’t happened.The result of all this: Jeremy Corbyn gets closer to power. As this newspaper revealed yesterday, Labour is now ahead in the seats that decide general elections thanks to its massive lead among renters.The likelihood of someone in their late twenties or early thirties on an average salary owning their own home has halved in the past  years.This is an electoral time bomb for the Tories. They can’t expect those without capital, or any prospect of getting it, to be capitalists.By the time of the next election, the Tories need to show people that their lives are getting better AND explain the damage  Corbyn would do to the country.One minister points the finger of blame at Number  for the Tory predicament. “A fish rots from the head down,” he tells me. But the Cabinet can’t escape its share of the blame, either.With a few exceptions, min­isters aren’t doing enough to take on Labour’s arguments. As one former Secretary of State fumed to me during Labour conference: “It’s outrageous. Where are the Cabinet ”If the Tories get Brexit wrong, it could cost them the next election. But eventhey get a decent deal, it won’t guarantee them victory. For the public will vote on domestic issues — whether the housing crisis is solved, the state of the health service and what is going on with schools.Corbyn has simple answers to all these questions: They might be wrong, but they are answers. The Tories now need to show the country  they have answers too.AT last, some positivity and optimism about this country’s post-Brexit future from the Government.I can reveal  it is planning a major new festival celebrating the UK for . The aim is for this festival to tell the world a story about Britain as we leave the EU and take charge of our own future. It is meant to coincide with the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee and the Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Birmingham that year.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright,  who is pushing this idea in Whitehall, has told colleagues  it will be: “Future-facing, telling a story about the UK’s unique strengths, particularly as a place to invest, as we forge a new future outside the European Union.”If the Government gets it right, this festival could be a great statement about the open, dynamic country that Britain is going to be after Brexit. It should emphasise how this country is going out into the world after leaving the EU, not pulling up the drawbridge.The aim should be to put on something that stands comparison with the great post-war Festival of Britain in  or even the Great Exhibition of , which showcased Victorian Britain’s global reach and technological edge.One Secretary of State, who is backing the idea, tells me: “People just want something really positive.”But cynics might note that there is an advantage for the Tories in a feel-good festival in an election year.But I understand he will  have a harsh message for the Westminster politicians in attendance. He will  tell them to stop bickering and positioning and get on with delivering for the country.Mr Street will say that outside the Westminster bubble, the public just want politicians to get on with things, rather than constantly jostling for position.What makes his  speech so interesting is that he is a Downing Street favourite. Indeed, I understand  some of those close to Theresa May are pushing for a similar tone in her speech.They believe  her post-Salzburg speech went down so well with the public not just because she was standing up to the EU but because she was taking charge and being that “bloody dficult woman”. They think she should use her speech to tell members  they won’t get everything  they want from the Brexit talks, but that she will get the best deal for Britain.Others, though, are wary of this approach. One Cabinet minister cautions that after last year, May should play it safe as “you can’t have two bad years  in a row”.THE Government has rightly guaranteed that the three million EU citizens living in Britain will be able to stay in the event of no deal.This is sensible. These citizens contribute a lot to this country, and help keep our economy and our public services moving.But it is also right that the Government is now discussing what the rules will be for deporting EU citizens who commit crimes after Brexit in a no-deal scenario.The details have not yet been decided and, as one government source puts it: “No one wants people deported for getting a parking ticket.”But it is right that those who are convicted of a signicant offence are removed.• SPOT the leadership bid will be one of the games  the Tories play in Birmingham.Any Cabinet minister who starts talking about their childhood will be accused of planning a run for the top job.  This leaves ministers walking a tightrope as they prepare their speeches. Some are dealing with this challenge by handing their time  to others.Penny Mordaunt, the Aid Secretary, is simply introducing a series of “British heroes” who do development work.But one of those involved in conference planning suspects that even this is about leadership as Mordaunt “doesn’t want to spend  minutes defending the aid budget to a hall of Tory activists”.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What’s great about the first episode is that the contestants, all of whom talk the talk about how fantastic they are, are thrown into the deep end with a task that’s designed to test their logic.They are sent on what is a bit like a treasure hunt, in Malta, armed only with a map and some euros.This task is all about logistics, negotiation and identying, and let’s say it doesn’t end well.It turns out that, unfortunately, logic is not something all the contestants are in possession of.During this series we will travel all over the country, including to Glasgow to sell emerging artists’ work to the unsuspecting public.When I say that task was more challenging than ever, I’m referring partly to the challenge of actually getting to Glasgow because it was during the storms. Remember them Turbulence was an under-statement. On the flight there, I was gritting my teeth and grabbing on to Claude like there was no tomorrow.One thing I love about the show is that there are equal numbers of men and women, and they are on a level playing field.Let’s face it, the same cannot be said out there in the “real” world.One thing I’ve been reflecting on over the course of my time on The Apprentice is how much things have changed for women in business since I started out.When I was having my kids  years ago, the very notion of “work-le balance” didn’t exist. But I’m pleased to say that working women aren’t trying to Have It All any more, and the days are gone when women feel the need to keep quiet about having kids at work.Women are now more able to demand flexible working and feel entitled to have time off for, say, ante-natal classes.More “mumpreneurs” are starting their own businesses. Still, you rarely catch working mothers using childcare as a reason for being absent from work — while men, I’ve noticed, almost get points for doing so.And it is still the case that working mothers and women working flexibly are less likely to be promoted.So I don’t quite agree with Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory MP, who wrote this week that women today have “never had it so good” yet still “whinge” about inequality.Because while it might be true that things have changed for the better, most CEOs are still male.Women might never have had it so good but it’s still not good enough — and it’s not “whingeing” to point that out.HONESTLY, watching Jeremy Corbyn forgetting Labour’s six tests for a Brexit deal, when interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, was like watching a hapless buffoon.No wonder he got two Es at A-level.This is the leader of the party that makes it up as it goes along – buying votes, promising everyone everything . . . and delivering absoutely nothing.As Margaret Thatcher said, The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money.HERE, The Apprentice star Karren picks out some highlights to look forward to during the show’s new season . . .Wyatt said: “Bill Cosby is doing great . . . Mr Cosby knows that God is watching over him . . . he knows that these are lies.“They persecuted Jesus and look what happened . . .  I’m not saying Mr Cosby is Jesus, but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries.”Just to be clear, Cosby’s conviction has nothing to do with race.The man is accused of rape and drug-facilitated sexual assault, by an astonishing  women . . . of all races and ages including some as young as .He has finally been put in prison and his victims have justice. He is a vile rapist, a violent sexual predator.His sentence is based on his crimes, not his colour.Unlike Cosby – a “disgusting sexual deviant” according to one of his victims – Jesus was innocent of the crimes laid against him.Cosby, meanwhile, has admitted to giving sedatives to young women in order to have sex with them.In short, Cosby admits his crimes, the jury find him guilty and the judge sentences him.Attempts to make this out as a racial issue are simply ridiculous.I KNOW it’s hard for men to face up to losing their hair, but someone needs to tell David Beckham that by far the best approach when it happens is . . . acceptance.But, judging from the photos of him looking a bit like a smiling Brillo pad this week that is not the route he is taking.David,you are reading this, you are a handsome man and no one caresyou have a thick head of hair or not – please don’t turn into Shane Warne.I guess the reality star has yet to realise no one is forcing her to go out.She just needs to learn the power of saying no.In the past, I had a dreadful habit of saying yes to an engagement when I meant no, then spent days trying to think of ways to get out of it.I completely changed my le when I decided to simply things by saying yes to an invitation when I wanted to go – and no when I didn’t.IT’S hard to believe not only that West Midlands Police are allowing “thrill-seekers” to spend Halloween in a cell used by serial murderer Fred West – but that they are charging them £ to do so.Offering this “spooky ghost hunt” at the notorious Steelhouse Lane cells in Birmingham is in very poor taste – so disrespectful of West’s victims, including his daughter who is a surviving casualty of his and is clearly still suffering every day.No doubt the relatives of those West murdered still suffer every day, too.So the fact that a stay in his old prison cell is being offered as Halloween entertainment is positively ghoulish.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Parliament. In the Government. And in the Cabinet”.Meanwhile hardline backbench Tory Brexiteers put on a concerted show of strength last night hinting they could oust the PMshe did not change her Chequers plan.Boris’s close ally Conor Burns took direct aim, warning: I say to the Prime Minister - we dont want to change you, we want you to change the policy of Chequers.And he urged her to please, please adopt a Canada style trade deal instead, suggesting the affection he held for the PM was at breaking point.And he was backed at the Brexit Central website rally by Jacob Rees Mogg, who said Chequers was “not only a dying duck in a thunderstorm, it’s the deadest dying duck in a thunderstorm.And he blasted campaigners for a so-called Peoples Vote, comparing them to Chinese communist and Libyan tyrant Gaddafi.He said: Once you put peoples in the title it is not true, it is about the elite, about those in charge and we should be very careful about that.A former Defence Minister also accused the PM of behaving like scheming Italian prince Machivelli and risked sending betrayed Tory voters into a political wilderness.Mark Francois - who served as Conservative frontbencher for  years - told The Sun the Chequers plan looks like “some Machiavellian process or series of backstairs deals” that has “sought to overturn their clearly expressed decision”.And he said the political weather meant those Brexit-loving Tory voters would be left homeless and may never vote again.A study yesterday revealed that Brexit is already costing the public purse £m a week.The Centre for European Reform’s analysis found the UK economy is already .% smaller than it would have been had Remain won the referendum.But in an attempt at a Brexit boost, ministers announced that the UK will host a nationwide Festival of Britain  Northern Ireland in .FORMER Labour Minister Digby Jones warned pro-business Tories must unite as “Jeremy Corbyn is to wealth creation what Diane Abbott is to mathematics”.SCOTS Tory MP Ross Thomson savaged the one word conference slogan “OPPORTUNITY”, raging: “I couldn’t help thinking of the other words ‘missed’, ‘lost’, ‘wasted’ and ‘squandered’.”TRANSPORT boss Chris Grayling’s own train to Birmingham was late — but he was spotted passing the time playing FarmVille on his phone rather than working.FORMER Remainer Jeremy Hunt delighted the Leave-backing party faithful by comparing the EU to the Soviet Union and then channelling Maggie Thatcher by telling Brussels “no, no, no”.TORY Peter Bone said ex-Ukip boss Nigel Farage should be made a Lord and put in charge of Brexit, adding: “If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody is hoping for voter-friendly treats.For a man in charge of our economic destiny at such a momentous time, this “stubby-pencilled accountant” has precious little to say. It seems he even remained mute at a recent Cabinet session to war-game a No-Deal Brexit — surely the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s special subject.Well-informed Spectator editor Fraser Nelson says other ministers piled in with upbeat projects but Hammond “seemed to have no ideas and kept quiet”. Spreadsheet Phil possesses either supreme self-confidence or total contempt for the .million who voted for Brexit, or both.The man who a year ago faced political death has become the most powerful figure in Theresa May’s Cabinet — perhaps including herself.She remains the figurehead. But the minister she planned to axe until her botched General Election is running the Brexit show from his Treasury eyrie.Hammond’s sympathetic image as Eeyore, a woebegone soft toy, is misleading. This man combines thin-skinned arrogance with a rare combination of political disabilities — cloth-eared, ham-fisted and leaden-footed.The grey image of bungled Budgets and barren creativity stands in vivid contrast to his outrageous Project Fear scaremongering. Mrs May certainly deserves blame for her hapless EU negotiations and the mutant Chequers plan for a Hi-HoBrexit.THE Tories have made a decent start to their conference – but they need to set their ambitions higher.Last week the Labour Party promised easy answers on everything from housing to the economy. It was a radical,utterly disastrous, vision for Britain.The Government changing tipping rules and increasing taxes on foreign property buyers is pretty small beer.Not least since the former was first announced three years ago and the latter is pretty much copied from last year’s Labour manesto.Philip Hammond — rarely mistaken for a ray of sunshine — needs to provide light at the end of the austerity tunnel.He must lay the groundwork for entrepreneurs to thrive in a newly liberated, unapologetically free market economy.And he should challenge business to work with him, too. The self-appointed “voices of British business”, iniably dominated by large corporate interests, push every day for more and more Brexit concessions.Yet as last week showed, Labour’s unreconstructed Marxism is a far more serious threat to future prosperity than any kind of Brexit.It’s time for big businesses to play their part in building a better Britain, rather than refighting a referendum which was as much a vote against them as the political establishment.Eeyore Hammond must encourage them to invest in Britain’s future.She survived last year’s election catastrophe only because Remainers feared a true Brexiteer such as Boris Johnson might replace her.Hammond has since deployed his Treasury reach to capitalise on her weakness and box us into BRINO — Brexit In Name Only. Mrs May is the willing captive of passionate Remainers in Downing Street, Whitehall, the Cabinet Office and, crucially, the all-powerful Treasury.Since the departure of close aide Nick Timothy, there is nobody within earshot who voted Brexit — including Mrs May. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, like his predecessor David Davis, has virtually no say in negotiations.Hammond now calls the shots, backed by panic-stirring Business Secretary Greg Clark and Europhile Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.Brexiteers fear this Unholy Trinity is ready for more concessions over issues including migration, EU benefits and Britain’s vital financial services industry.Never forget, it was Hammond who blocked all spending and therefore all serious preparation for No Deal, a prospect now apparently facing this nation. In fact there was never a chance of No Deal.We will end up with a form of Chequers, but one even more pro-Brussels than the proposal which saw David Davis and BoJo storm out. Remainers are back in full Project Fear mode.European car firms are happily pouring billions into Britain — despite Brexit. Yet Greg Clark triggered last week’s chorus of fake alarm from Toyota, claiming its “just-in-time” supply chain would grind to a halt.This ignores the whole point of “just-in-time”. It is designed specically to cope with delivery glitches and operates worldwide in all circumstances under global trade rules.It was also Clark who handed Brussels its biggest anti-Brexit card by promising those shroud-waving car giants the UK would remain under EU rules. That led directly to Mrs May’s surrender over the Northern Ireland border, which has plagued negotiations ever since.It is a tragic fact — but no surprise — that we are now heading remorselessly for a deal on EU terms at our expense.EU leaders were never going to see us thrive outside. They insisted we will not be better off after Brexit.Anyone who hoped we might be set free to compete on equal terms should read ex-Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis’ story of his own country’s punishment beating.It was Varoufakis who compared Brexit with the Eagles’ hit: “It’s like Hotel Calornia — you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” And we can blame Phil Hammond for blocking the fire Brexits.But Ms Jourova, a Czech raised under Soviet rule, wants Corbyn-style “regulation” of the free Press.The apple never falls far from the tree.PS.

It was a quiet week, so I watched the first four episodes and, to my surprise and delight, I hated Press even more than I expected.The set-up’s the deal-breaker, of course. We’ve got a right-wing red-top called The Post, that’s very obviously meant to be The Sun, and a left-wing broadsheet The Herald, which is equally obviously , house Bible of the BBC.The former is edited by soul-selling clone Duncan Allen, played by the brilliant Ben Chaplin, who does actually resemble a couple of ex-colleagues.By rights then, the female lead should be The Herald’s editor, Amina Chaudury, played by Priyanga Burford.But she can’t act, so the responsibility’s fallen to Charlotte Riley as northern, working-class brick of Deputy News Editor Holly Evans, who fits the social profile of your averagewoman about as comfortably as Roy Chubby Brown fits a mankini.Next weird thing you probably notice about Press is that nearly all the characters are giving speeches, rather than talking normally to each other.Especially the insufferable broadsheet hacks, who never stop reminding each other “we speak the truth to the powerful”, and that “people buy The Herald for the truth”.Why do people buy The Post Sun It’s never really occurred to writer Mike “Doctor Foster” Bartlett, who clearly didn’t read our newspaper before he sat down to type Press, at his desk on the summit of Mount Olympus, and has probably never met a tabloid reader either, without telling them: “Keep the change.”How can I be so sure Because it’s got almost every single professional and technical aspect wrong, from Duncan’s insistence he’s going to do a spread “On page five and six” , to the week one headline The Post produced about the gay, blackmailed footballer who committed suicide: “Parents never knew their son.”Which is the sort of meaningless, esoteric b******s that would get thrown back at a student newspaper sub.That’s another unconvincing thing about Press, incidentally. No one swears. And I wouldn’t mind so muchthere were some decent stories to see us through, but there aren’t.There’s a Katie Hopkins figure floating around, a few cut-and-pasted bits of very old tabloid legendand some deep state conspiracy cobblers, which the BBC’s probably got written into Raa Raa The Noisy Lion these days.Duncan also has the vague hots for Holly, until such time as Ed off the newsdesk tells him she likes having it off in a grey vest.That’s about your lot, though.As always happens when British TV tries to dramatise the Press, the writer’s left-of-centre political agenda and prejudices trump everything .This is why Americans do it so much better, andyou want to see how newspapers really operate you’ll get a much better idea from Billy Wilder’s  film The Front Page than you ever will from Press.I’ll say this for the BBC production team though, they might not have much of an ear for newspaper dialogue, but they’ve got a hell of an eye for interior design and have duplicated one item of our office kitchen crockery perfectly.Mugs.“I don’t bend in the middle any more, to be honest.”Then just slap him around a bit.Improvise, woman.FURTHER proof,it were needed, there’s not a single television format that can’t be improved by the presence of one or two of the Happy Mondays arrived on Friday.A special BBC Music Day edition of Bargain Hunt, featuring Bez and Rowetta versus Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle, which will go down in daytime TV folklore.Attempting to keep them in some sort of order, at the Kent showground’s antique fair, was BH regular Charlie Ross, who didn’t get very far with his preliminary question: “How did it all start with the Happy Mondays, Bez ”“You really don’t want to know.”So you really couldn’t blame him for looking a bit nervous when he sent the pair of them away with £ in used notes.Half an hour later, though, Bez and Rowetta were back, with three items, including a biscuit tin and a to-die-for rustic, bygone horse collar mirror that’s yours for just  quid.It made them a respectable £ profit at auction, as well, and flattened Pulp’s efforts in the process.At which point things got a bit dark.Charlie noted “an irregularity”, the Mondays were hauled back on set, like guilty schoolkids, and the host was forced to explain that the winsome and very obliging woman at the back of the auction hall, who kept bidding for his items was in fact: “Bez’s girlfriend.”Not angry, Bez, just disappointed.IF you’ve never seen the brilliant Simpsons episode where Homer gives Pinchy, his pet lobster, a really hot bath, Google it as soon as you can.Then immediately after, watch Channel ’s darkly funny latest episode of Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where a pig wandered into camp, on Sunday night.Even more obligingly it then started fattening itself up on the celebs’ leftovers and inviting the obvious by crapping its load everywhere.While some sensed dinner, Towie’s Pete Wicks had a better idea.He named the pig Colin, took it for a walk and then tethered it with a rope to some rocks.Whereupon Colin, with the sort of demonic squeals and grunts you last heard on Deliverance, promptly strangled himself to death.Presented with this tragedy, you or I or Martin Kemp from Spandau Ballet, might’ve drawn the obvious conclusion and, like Homer Simpson, tucked in Not this lot.Instead Colin was buried at sea, with full military honours, to avoid “hurting Pete’s feelings”, floating off into the sunset like a warning to humanity.This MorningSemra Haksever: “I call myself an eclectic witch, so I take dferent little bits of magic from all over the place.So it’s all b******sOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In contrast, the over-s are positively chipper: Only  per cent of this group reported feelings of isolation.Now, I’m  and, depressingly, these statistics don’t surprise me.At first glance, it looks like young people have it easy when it comes to making friends.At  or thereabouts, more than  per cent of them will be packed off to university where they’ll move in with a group of like-minded people of the same age and be encouraged to drink and party like there’s no tomorrow.Which, when you’re only required to stumble out of bed for one pm lecture, there essentially isn’t.Rather than relying on friends of tenuous friends for dubious introductions, young people these days can simply download an app and get the details of thousands of eligible strangers delivered straight to their mobile phones.Add into the mix social media ­— which allows its users to connect with everyone they’ve ever met instantaneously at any given moment — and it’s hard to imagine how any young people could possibly be lonely, let alone  per cent.But there are two sides to every coin.University — though a godsend when it comes to meeting new people — can be a problem when it comes to staying in touch with them. Saddled with bottomless debt, young graduates simply don’t have the cash to socialise.When a round for six at a London pub will set you back  quid, is it any wonder that more and more young people are opting to stay at home Dating apps, too, come with their pitfalls. Yes, it’s nice to have a database of singletons in your pocket, but the ubiquity of Tinder and Bumble mean it’s now considered almost socially awkward to speak to someone you fancy in person.A friend of mine, who has absolutely no problem propositioning women on Tinder, hasn’t yet found the courage to ask for his next-door neighbour’s number, four months after she moved in.As for social media, young people like me are increasingly discovering that “staying connected” is a mixed blessing at best. With no excuse to lose touch, my generation holds on to friends we’ve outgrown, leaving us with no time to make new ones. It may sound callous, but there’s an art to shedding friends, and thanks to our social media addiction, we seem to have lost it.What’s more, earnest  to -year-olds seem to be taking to heart the faddish health advice that adults have been merrily ignoring for years, making it even harder for them to socialise because they fear alcohol, and even food.At the end of a recent party I got chatting to a fun young woman, so I suggested some pub grub at a boozer to round off the evening. How wrong I was.She explained in detail she was vegan and on a gluten-free diet , so the pub menu would not cater for her needs.I decided not to pursue it.So I say it’s time snowflake millennials took a bit of responsibility for their own feelings of isolation.Last month commentators wagged their fingers at the big tech companies after a survey by charity YoungMinds revealed a greater number of young people view social media as having a negative impact on the way they feel about themselves than those who report a positive impact.But it was never suggested depressed young people should simply put away their phones and do something .Mollycoddled millennials believe having a thriving social circle is a human right, rather than an ongoing project.Instead of popping to the pub for a pick-me-up with whoever happens to be around, a lonely young person will all too often turn to the internet for a spot of indulgent self-reflection, or to the gym for Insta-friendly self-improvement.As a result, pubs are closing at a rate of  a day, and sites such as Tumblr are overflowing with posters instructing users to “forget the haters” and “shine like the star that you are”.Of course, social media is made to be addictive. But surely putting down a phone can’t be an insurmountable challenge for an educated generation of young people  Dwelling on yourself is the surest route to a lonely lestyle, so instead of posting doleful, introspective memes on social media or clinging to tired old friendships, lonely young people should find the guts to get outside and look outwards.Making and keeping real friends takes work, and it’s time young people started putting the hours in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many were found in village temples and played a part in local folklore.Mr Risbood told the BBC: We walked thousands of kilometres.

We made students ask their grandparents and other village eldersthey knew about any other engravings.

But the images depict hunted animals and theres detailing of animal forms. So this man knew about animals and sea creatures. That indicates he was dependent on hunting for food.All kinds of animals, including sharks, whales and turtles feature in the carvings, while human figures and geometrical designs also appear.Since the remarkable discovery, the researchers have been working to document the thousands of ancient carvings and spur efforts to preserve them.The state government has designated  million rupees to study  of the petroglyphs in greater detail, according to the BBC."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000438715244.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"voodoo dolls russian city krasnodar mystery","story":"Pensioners complained of blood pressure problems after seeing the spooky mannequins nailed to fences or propped up at bus stops.Residents called for an explanation of the dozens of weird dolls which reportedly appeared overnight in Zavetny in the Krasnodar region.There were also complaints to police.One resident told local media: “Creepy dolls are nailed to the pillars, fences and bus stops.“The little girl mannequins are pierced with needles and tied with black threads.”Another householder said: “Two were sitting at a bus stop.“A doll in a in a pink ball gown was found in the park.”A local warned: “A curse has been put on our village.”Several were eyeless or one-armed and were all dressed in girls clothes or school unorms.Head of the local council Dmitry Barkov said: “We have urgently brought together police officers to instruct them to calm people.”Police are studying CCTV cameras to identy those who distributed the dolls around the area even though planting voodoo dolls is not a crime, say reports.Meanwhile a local security officer has admitted dumping the mannequins - “the same size as a child” - at a local tip.Tatiana Kokoreva claimed they belonged to a local culture museum and were previously used in a puppet theatre which closed long ago.They were no longer needed and the security officer thought her daughter, a teacher, could use them.But the school rejected them as unsafe and too scary, so she dumped them.She insisted she was not responsible for dressing them up as voodoo dolls."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000438652682.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"these unfortunate tattoos could be mistaken for something rude if youve got a dirty mind","story":"In a series of hilarious snaps, people have been showing off their supposedly innocent inkings.But those of you with a dirty, sex-filled mind will see phallic images hidden within these designs.From a woman who had a signature inked on her back, to a babys tiny hand clutching its mothers finger, the etchings are causing much hilarity online.In one picture, a womans jellyfish tattoo with its dangling tentacles could be misconstrued as something X-rated painted on her torso.And is that a flamingo on another womans foot  Perhaps she and her inked mates will think twice about that second tattoo..."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000438733246.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"girl found walking streets pyjamas woodley berkshire","story":"Thames Valley Police searched for the unattended girl, spotted wearing pink pyjamas, in two separate incidents in Woodley, Berkshire.She was first sighted at am on Saturday morning by a worried woman who called the police, triggering a frantic -hour manhunt.But the search was eventually called off because no one matching the little girls description was reported missing.Then cops got another call late on Monday night saying that a child in her pyjamas was completely alone near a parade of shops.Officers scrambled to a local Lidl where they found the seven-year-old by herself.They quickly established that it was the same girl who was spotted early on Saturday morning.After finding her, police reported the incidents to Social Services.It is understood that cops have interviewed her family.The girl, who has not been named, is believed to have let herself out of her home in darkness and then later ed home to her house in Woodley.Police said that as a result of both incidents, safeguarding measures were being enacted to protect the child.A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: Officers attended the Lidl store in Headley Road, Woodley, at around pm following reports of a young girl walking alone in the precinct.On arrival, officers located a seven-year-old girl.

Welcome to the Conservative Party conference of , where the Tories are trying to pretend they can organise a knees-up that doesnt somehow end in whacking themselves in the testicles.Its day one, and theyve already failed. Their Great Blond Hope has not only been victim of a Big Daddy splash by Lord Digby Jones, hes been impersonated by Phil Voldemort Hammond and had his ideas characterised as not much good by David Mine Are No Better Davis.We are now uncomfortably close to the arbitrary date for leaving the European Union, chosen by a Prime Minister who herself was chosen because she wasnt someone , and as is the way with things on horizons it looks worryingly like an out-of-control hydrogen explosion.We all know whats happened - the referendum supposed to uny the Tories has caused them to turn on each other like cannibals who gave up chlorinated chicken for Lent, the question supposed to be settled for a generation remains unanswered, and Theresa May is still PM primarily because she isnt someone .So what is Brexit going to look like, under the Tories  . Project Oh Dear Jeremy Hunt is a man who has more in common with an Anglepoise lamp than the rest of the human race. He can be pointed, turned on, and turned off again, but usually fails to illuminate anyone. He is now second-favourite to be Prime Minister next year, which should be adequate proof of just how boked the Tories are.Boris is trolling, Sajid and Gavin are manoeuvring, Chris Grayling is in a siding outside Melton Mowbray and Hunt - a man who, the Leveson Inquiry heard, tried to hide behind trees to avoid journalists while still being visible to them - is now, let me say it again, one of the favourites. Its a bit like saying the green Opal Fruit is your favourite. Or that the USSR, which invaded countries that tried to leave it and killed millions, is just like the EU, which negotiates, even with people who dont know what theyre doing. . Project You Cant Be Serious  Having toured the country in a bus promising to give our EU subscription to the NHS, the Tories have since said: a well still have to pay a subscription b it will be higher, without a rebatec by the way, well be cutting pound.bn off the NHSToday the spiritual leader of the Brextremists has suggested we spend our foreign aid budget on saving elephants, because they remind him of Beethovens Fth Symphony. Hang the education projects, stuff the small-scale charities who exist entirely because of foreign aid, and lets get all worked up about the  pence in every pound national profit that we spend on foreigners. Boo hiss to foreigners! Elephants are British! Wait, what  . Project Is This Really The Best You Could Do  Brexit, the Tories are assuring us and their donors, will mean a bonfire of unnecessary rules and regulations about meaningless, bureaucratic tripe like child car seats, not getting killed at work and hiding your money from the taxman.It gives us a chance to set our own rules such as only banning dangerous cladding  months after it burned  people alive, and onlyits on new buildings, which means all the people living in older properties can go sizzle.It also wont matteryou sleep surrounded by highly-flammable material on the sixth floor, oryou dont have a sprinkler system, or the fire exits are blocked or non-existent. After Brexit, you wont want to live anyway. . Project Genuine Fear  The government of the UK is trying to exit a union it doesnt want while protecting one that it does. To do so they are relying on a referendum they say must be respected, while ignoring a referendum they say must be over-ridden.All the people concerned were told beforehand that Brexit would spell the end of the Good Friday Agreement, a hard-won peace in Northern Ireland, and possibly the end of the Union altogether. That they have now,  months from doom, had this explained to them again by a comedian shows just what a bad joke the Tories are.Patrick Kieltys dad was murdered by the Ulster Freedom Fighters for exposing their organised crime. The Tories border solution involves asking those self-same people to pretend theres a border where there isnt one, and file paperwork well in advance before smuggling guns, drugs and people across  miles of hedge that we cant police. Laugh  Youll die. . Project It All Onto Someone Else Presiding over economic chaos  Watching John Lewis go down the pan, the world turn against you, and Jacob Rees-Mogg destroying all his own suggestions by moving his investment funds to the EU and trying to get a trade deal with the Peoples Republic of Jam Jar Or Something Like That  Well, why not shoot some more badgers. Not in the head, thats too quick. Kneecap them and watch them suffer. Burn some cattle, bankrupt some farmers, blame it all on the EUs crazy rules about bovine TB which isnt harmless so long as you pasteurise your milk, mostly doesnt kill cows and could easily be stopped with a vaccineonly we could be bothered.When someone says but Brexit means we can abandon these rules! Save the badgers! point out we still have to abide by EU ruleswe want to sell beef, milk or cheese to the EU. And dont, for heavens sake, let anyone say that the only way to change those rules is to, er, remain in the EU.With a Tory Brexit, hard or soft, youre looking at Jeremy Hunt being in charge while making swingeing NHS cuts, making it quite the worst reboot of a franchise since Indiana Jones And The Hospital Of Doom.Youll see people burning in another tower block before long, a fresh wave of terrorism when we havent dealt with the current one, and Tories blaming badgers, migrants, and anything  that moved because, after Brexit, theyll no longer be able to blame the EU. The Tories have spent the past  years blaming Europe for all the things they cocked up themselves. Without the EU, people are going to blame the Tories. Which is why their days are numbered.

I would never buy a watch online,” the -year-old mogul says, flashing a Rolex on his wrist. “I can’t remember the last thing I bought online,” adds the billionaire, who started selling goods out of a van. Lord Sugar, who trades on his no-nonsense image, suggests some high street shops would be okay. “Touchy-feely stuff, where you need to actually go and touch and feel or eat it, I suppose has still got a le,” he says. “But our high street is made up now of coffee shops, delis and little cafes and nail bars, and all that type of stuff.”  Is he not worried our communities could become derelict unless we turn high streets around  “It’s worrying but I don’t know what the solution is,” he says. “Unless it’s some niche market like clothing or dresses or menswear or whatever that’s specialised.” Lord Sugar appears resigned to shypeople now shopping online, saying: “I mean, most people now, young ladies in particular, buy a load of their clothes online. “You have the opportunity of buying five dresses at once and sending four back just to see which one suits you more. “You’ve even got the situation where a nasty person will buy a dress online wear it to a party and send it back anyway.” Lord Sugar, whose dad started in the rag trade, warms to his theme: “On top of that you have giants like Primark and Matalan that now have not the traditional season you used to have in fashion – autumn, winter and summer – but  seasons, every week they are replenishing the store with new range. “And the cost of the merchandise is such it’s disposable. Many years ago, a young lady would buy herself a rather expensive dress in relation to her salary.  “Now she can go and buy a dress for the same price as a gin and tonic and throw it away.” This is not, it should be said, entirely on message with the Mirror’s High Street fightback campaign, which is promoting positive ways of reviving our towns and cities. Today, though, our most famous shybusinessman wants to mainly talk about cakes. In particular, he wants to chat about the Ridiculously Rich cake brand created by Apprentice winner Alana Spencer, which may or may not have been named in honour of the man who hired her.

At least that way, the  champion of the hit BBC reality show would get a word in the conversation. Alana wants to tell the Mirror about her new Grab ‘n’ Go range – which includes, appropriately enough, Millionaire’s Shortbread, and she plans to sell through “cakepreneurs”. But this is proving something of a challenge, as every time she starts to speak Lord Sugar interrupts her. These cakepreneurs, explains Alana, sell her products at food festivals, country shows and markets. “Let me try and explain it,” says Lord Sugar. “You have got the ambassadors who have exclusivity for a certain area where they can sell at fairs and places like that.

Jordan Adams from Redditch, Worcestershire, has been told the chances of getting his condition are less than winning the EuroMillions and says he has been incredibly unlucky. Although he has no signs of the illness now, doctors have said he could lose the ability to walk, talk and eat for himself at any time. He has also been told his le could end in his fties, like his mum Geri, who died at the age of .  Jordan was told he would develop early onset frontotemporal dementia and Parkinson’s Disease after inheriting a gene - which caused the degenerative conditions - from his mum. Last month, doctors gave the entrepreneur the crushing news he had a rare mutation of the MAPT gene, which causes the condition. And he has been warned his health will deteriorate as he gets older. He now plans to have his sperm screened for the gene so he and girlfriend Lucy Thomas, , can start a family before his symptoms develop.  Jordan also plans to tick travelling to Hawai, buying a house, and doing a skye off a bucket list. He said: “When I was told the diagnosis I was devastated. “We had been in the waiting area for what seemed like hours – it was only  minutes but it felt like an eternity. “As soon as I walked into the room I knew it wasn’t a positive result. “Nobody can prepare you for that. “If there are no advancements then I’ll have a shorter le than most. It’s like a death sentence. “Its very hard to explain. Were all dealt cards in le and I was just incredibly unlucky.  Jordan was given the news he had tested positive for the gene when he and sister Kennedy,  decided to get themselves checked after watching mum Geri deteriorate over a period of six years. He was finally given the results on September  after three gruelling months of consultations and blood tests. Jordan said he saw the full impact of the disease while caring for Geri, as he watched her lose the ability to talk, walk and eventually eat and breathe for herself. Her family first noticed something was wrong in , when she suddenly began acting out of character. However she was not diagnosed until  and sadly passed away in . Jordan said: “Mum was full of love and very much a people person. “No one had a bad word to say about her, she was very kind and lovely. “We’d noticed irregularities in her behaviour. I remember one Saturday she went to pick up Kennedy from school but it was a weekend. “Her character changed from being a loving woman and she became quite cold. “She seemed to lack compassion which was a huge change from when she’d covered us in love. “She slowly got stripped of her communication. She couldn’t talk a lot and then she began to lose her mobility and couldn’t go out alone. “As the disease progressed she lost the ability to walk and care for herself and for the last  months she was bedridden. It was heartwrenching.”  Jordan said that despite his initial shock, he and girlfriend Lucy have discussed plans for their future together and that he feels like his diagnosis will give him a unique perspective on le. They are considering having IVF when they decide to start a family as the process will allow doctors to screen his sperm for the dementia-carrying gene. Jordan said: “I feel like the diagnosis is actually a licence to live. “It’ll make me step back and appreciate the bigger picture. It’s going to allow me to make choices to live a fulfilled le. Lucy added: “We’ve decided that it’d be probably best to have children first and then get married. “We know it’s dferent to how most people would it do but it’ll give Jordan more time with his kids. “It’s hard to deal with knowing he won’t be there one day but it’s important to retain perspective. “We will have a le together despite everything.” "},{"url":null,"title":"penguin shortage means telford exotic","story":"NewsPenguin shortage means Telford Exotic Zoo uses models instead of real animalsPenguin malaria has meant a delivery of six Humboldt penguins has not arrivedShareCommentsByEd Chatterton:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsModels are being used instead of real animals \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA zoo has been forced to fill a brand new enclosure with model penguins - because the cannot get hold of the real thing. A shortage of birds has meant visitors to Exotic Zoo, in Telford, Shropshire, have been left disappointed. Their latest exhibit has been filled with plastic figurines of the flightless birds. Tens of thousands of pounds has been spent on the new specialist enclosure which was due to open in time for the summer holidays. A delivery of six Humboldt penguins, which are native to South America, was expected this July but the zoo was unable to get any due to an outbreak of avian malaria.  Zoo director Scott Adams instead decided to fill the empty enclosure with models until they can get real penguins for visitors to enjoy. TV animal man Scott, , - who was a regular face on Blue Peter and The Alan Titchmarsh Show - said: Weve just timed it really badly. The enclosure is the zoos most expensive to date and we had hoped to have it open for the start of the summer holidays. But then disaster struck. Because of the outbreak of penguin malaria we were unable to get hold of three pairs we had been planning to get in for visitors to enjoy. Instead weve had to use le-size models of ious dferent species of penguins so we can at least educate visitors to an extent.  Weve got signs up explaining the situation. Its been really disappointing but its been out of our control really. Unfortunately over the last couple of years there was a really bad case of penguin malaria that swept through the UK. Lots of zoos,not most zoos, have lost a lot of penguins and in some case most of their stock. Most of the big zoos are getting their penguins back so any spares that would have come to us from the surplus lists or from stud books from other zoos are not available. Because we are a relatively small zoo we are not top of the list when it comes to replenishing those numbers. Penguins only mate once a year, so weve got to sit back and let nature take its course until the numbers build up in the UK and Europe. Scott is even planning to dress a member of his staff in a penguin costume over the Christmas period as he doesnt believe the problem will be rectied until the new year. He added: Were not really anticipating getting any real penguins in until next year, which is a real shame considering the enclosure cost us tens of thousands of pounds. Weve already got contingency plans in place for the Christmas period when we will dress up a member of staff in a penguin costume so at least the children will have something to enjoy. We had a private company come in and created for us a really impressive enclosure, complete with clfs, rockwork and water features. It took a couple of months.

Model Kira Mayer, , claimed she was victimised behind bars with many prisoners resenting her glamorous looks.Her chest was scalded “to the bone” in the alleged attack and months after the incident she still has a “red bleeding scar,” she said. She claims she got into a row with her cellmates who expected her as a “newcomer” to clean the cell and toilet. And the social-media star is shocked by le in prison in general - and says she wants to be fed oysters and have hotel service.  Speaking of the alleged attack, Mayer said: “Its been two months now, there was a deep burn to the bone. “And here they did not even give me any special medication to treat this. “I was just sent to the punishment box. “Im not a rebel, but I was strongly against the pressure on ‘newcomers . Despite reports that she suffered facial injuries the model revealed to a human rights monitor that the serious wound was to her chest. Human rights monitor and prison visitor Eva Merkacheva - also a prominent Russian journalist - wrote: “Incredibly, she manages to look the same behind bars as she looks in her Instagram. “Long hair, and huge doll-like eyelashes.”  The prisoner, used to tropical photoshoots and exotic holidays, said: “I’m always beautulthe media visit me.” And Mayer has not let the incident prevent her from making a series of extraordinary demands from warders in her Moscow detention centre ahead of her move to a penal colony for her  month sentence. But insistence on being served oysters and deliveries from top restaurants has not gone down well. Mayer said: When they brought me some strange porridge for breakfast, I asked: Can I have a hot croissant, orange fresh, mixed omelette and cheese  “I thought it was possible to order food here like in hotel. They laughed. “Next, they have such ugly metal bowls here. I cant eat from them, I’m afraid.” She said she only eats on plastic plates delivered by her family. “I am offering to introduce a paid service for delivery from restaurants so that they can bring oysters and fish, she said. “I want oysters so badly.”  She complained: “My bed is made of metal bars. “I asked for a normal one with an orthopaedic mattress, and they laughed at me again. It also turned out phones are not allowed here. I used to have three mobile phones and was on Instagram all the time. “I askedI could get even the most basic iPhone with internet but they laughed at me even more.” Mayer pleaded guilty to assaulting a traffic police officer who stopped her driving her Mercedes without a licence on the way to a manicure in Moscow. She offered a threesome to the officer and his colleaguethey ignored her motoring offence, according to reports citing law enforcement sources. The policemen “declined her offer and detained her”, it was reported.  From her cell she admitted to Merkacheva that she was “very afraid” of jail. Later she said she “told myself I had to continue living. “Now I almost dont cry,” said Mayer, ex-girlfriend of Russian pop-singer Alexey Vorobyov. “My regular le is gone. “I was on the way to my manicure - but ended up in a detention jail.” She said: “Only now do I realise I used to live like a princess. “I spent the whole summer behind bars, its sad. “I want to go to the Seychelles. “I do breathing exercises and it makes it better. “Half of my fellow inmates didnt like me straight away for my looks. “The other half were asking me all sorts of girly questions.”  She also blamed her female judge Katerina Kirichenko for her “harsh” sentence, claiming she “did not like me”. “In our country you can go to jail simply because you annoy someone,” she said. She admitted trying to hide the fact that she had been jailed “but it leaked out”. She said: “I realised that jail might be good and will increase my popularity.” Her latest ploy is to suggest a hair selling business to her jail governor.

But instead of wallowing in her feelings and getting down, Amy hit back in an inspirational Facebook post. The -year-old from Texas wrote: I saw a friend I hadn’t seen in a while today. We chatted and hugged and she laughed and said I can’t believe I’m seeing you out in public with no makeup and tennis shoes. Who even are you anymore  I laughed because it’s true.

We hugged, promised to grab lunch soon, knew we probably never would, and went our separate ways.

There’s a good chance we’ll discover they have in fact found themselves and appreciated themselves and loved themselves and realized that who they are as a human has absolutely nothing to do with their fake eyelashes or their highlights or their giant leathery feathery earrings , and absolutely everything to do with their heart, and their mind, and their soul, she proclaimed. She ended her post by reminding other parents that they are so much more than just a pretty face. You haven’t let yourself go. Stop saying that. It’s rude. It’s derogatory, and it’s downright absurd. You haven’t let yourself go, you have simply let go of the need to look perfect all of the time, she said. Put on makeup when you can, get your hair did when you find the time, pamper yourself, take care of yourself, splurge on a new outfit and don’t you dare feel bad about it for one second — just know that none of those outside things define you.

But on Saturday North Korea dramatically ruled out nuclear disarmament - saying it does not have enough trust in the US. The countrys Foreign Minister, Ri Yong ho, told the United Nations that continued sanctions on Pyongyang were deepening its mistrust in the United States. He said: Without any trust in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first. The Foreign Minister, representing ruler Kim Jong-uns secretive state, said North Korea had made goodwill steps, but these had not been reciprocated. It comes after US President Donald Trump praised Kim at the UN, a year on from branding him a rocket man on a suicide mission.The missiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction, nuclear testing has stopped, some military facilities are already being dismantled, Trump said. I would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken, though much work remains to be done, Trump said. The sanctions will stay in place until denuclearisation occurs.

It is hard to defend United manager Csaba Laszlo now and it would be no surprisehe is given his jotters after this most horric of days.It started when eventual hat-trick hero and former Tangerine Billy Mckay opened the scoring from close range on  minutes, knocking in a Josh Mullin cross.The only chink of light in the game came six minutes later as Pavol Safranko got on the end of Fraser Aird#s delivery to guide the ball past Scott Fox in the away net.From there United laboured and County took advantage. Scoring the most simple and avoidable goals # often carbon copies of each other.The second came on  minutes after a Jamie Robson mistake played in Mullin to square for Mckay to knock in.On  minutes the same problems United had faced all game down their left-hand side were there for all to see as Sean Kelly inswinging free-kick went all the way through past Matej Rakovan in the home net. A horrible goal to concede with no communication evident and the defence at sixes and sevens.Soon after the restart the Staggies put the game to bed when Mullin and Mckay linked up again with the former this time tapping in from a yard out on  minutes.Mullin turned provider, once more, two minutes later laying Mckay#s hat-trick on a plate for him and the Northern Irishman gobbled it up from a matter of inches out.Csaba tried to change things for the Tangerines, but by this point the punters had seen enough and were leaving in their droves and calling for his head in the process, as he brought on Stewart Murdoch and Fraser Fyvie to try to change things on  minutes.And three minutes later Murdoch summed up the Terrors afternoon as he was shown a straight red for a stamp on Jamie Lindsay.It capped what was United#s worst performance in years as County saw out the rest of the game with little problem.

I just felt we needed to get the first win and I believe in them to go on now.“We enjoyed the weekend because it had been a long time coming.“It’s a relief to get the three points, I’m not going to lie but I’m really pleased for the guys because I’ve been talking for weeks about the belief I still have in them that they could get a result.“I thought we were well worth the three points.“I thought we absolutely dominated the first half, we didn’t change how we played – there’s no use in me saying I have belief in them and then changing how we play.“I thought it was the right way to go on Saturday and we dominated the ball, created chances and it was a great header from Boyle.”On more than one occasion this season Dundee have had the better of the overall play but were unable to take advantage by grabbing the lead.This time, though, with Preston loanee Boyle’s th minute header they did just that and, after seeing Accies pass up a number of chances, sealed victory in stoppage time as Madianga smashed the ball beyond Gary Woods to send the fans and the bench delirious.Neil added: “It was sheer joy. Football is about winning games and when you’re down sometimes you don’t get a lot of luck but we got a bit of luck on Saturday.“I’ve been hammering to them about getting into the lead but we’ve been conceding goals quickly and that belief that you can win games clearly reduces.“I just said to them that our gameplan is to get into the lead, not to just sit back and try to recover from - down.“However, only they can make that happen. Hamilton will have said, ‘get a goal against them and they’re dead’ but the players were well fired up on Saturday, I didn’t have to do anything.“When the goal goes in from Boyle, great delivery from Calvin Miller, you know you have something tangible to hang on to.“I’m so pleased, I don’t want to go overboard because it is only three points but it is a big three points for the club.”"},{"url":null,"title":"these were csaba laszlos last words as dundee united boss","story":"Deep inside the bowels of Tannadice was where Csaba Laszlo carried out one of his last acts as Dundee United manager, speaking to the press after his team hit self destruct in losing - to Ross County on Saturday.Csaba was quizzed on where it all went wrong for him, not just on the day, but over the course of his near year-long reign as the sense he was a dead man walking filled the air.He was down and seemed defeated when laying out his defence and it was clear it was going to be the last time he spoke as the manager of Dundee United Football Club.Askedhe had considered resigning, he said: “I don’t think resigning is an option but it was a terrible result.“The team know that and we have to take the responsibility for it.“It wasn’t just one or two people # it’s the full team who have to take the responsibility.“I don’t think we are so bad going by results but we lost five goals at home.“Especially being so positive after the Falkirk game, we were % going into this dficult run.“We knew it wasn’t going to be easy but we showed real confidence and the injured players have slowly been coming back.“We wanted to avoid a result like Saturday – it’s not what we wished for.”Csaba did confirm that, as ever, he would speak with chairman Mike Martin which ultimately led to him being sacked on Sunday afternoon.The Hungarian also conceded he and the players had let the fans down with the display and recent struggles.He added: “I believe in my players and they feel the same after losing the game.“They don’t want to push the responsibility away – it’s not that easy.

Last year he had two games in the hotseat after Ray McKinnon was sacked and led the team back to the top of the ision via impressive victories over eventual champions St Mirren and away to Dumbarton.At the time that prompted the board to urge him to apply for the job permanently but Ellis felt he lacked the experience to take on a club of United’s size.A year on that view might have changed and, was he to succeed Csaba, he would be a popular appointment in the dressing-room.The fact he’s a leading contender is further indication of how highly he is rated by his employers. While it was hoped Csaba would be the man to lead the team back to the Premiership, for some time now the former Raith Rovers stalwart has been viewed by many within Tannadice as a future boss.That said he does face competition from others with more experience and both Neilson and McIntyre will be interested.The pair could need convincing the Tangerines can succeed.Although he’s been out of a job since ending a dficult spell in England with MK Dons in January, Neilson’s stock north of the border remains high.As head coach of Hearts for two years from , he guided the Tynecastle outfit to promotion from a Championship that included hot favourites Rangers and Edinburgh rivals Hibs.On a tight budget, he then steered them to a top-six finish and Europa League qualication in their first season back in the Premiership.McIntyre has considerable experience from his time in charge at Dunfermline, Queen of the South and Ross County, where he lted the League Cup.He’s been out of a job since being sacked by the Staggies in September last year.While it’s known both are keen to get back in management, they’ll onlyin the right circumstances.In August, McIntyre turned down the offer to succeed Paul Hartley at Falkirk. He felt the budget there would not be sufficient to mount a promotion challenge.Likewise, earlier in the summer the vacant post at St Mirren was there for the taking for Neilson.After talks with the board, the -year-old decided their expectations were unrealistic and the job wasn’t for him."},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"Swindonrsquos own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the thAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"jim-brogan-tears-as-friends-and-family-gather-in-glasgow-to-say-goodbye-to-celtic-legend","story":"THE funeral of Celtic legend Jim Brogan has taken place in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"major-search-for-young-coatbridge-woman-who-vanished-from-her-family-home-distressed","story":"A YOUNGCoatbridge woman who has been dealing with personal issues has been found safe and well."},{"url":null,"title":"paisley-goes-spooky-for-halloween","story":"ltBodyTextgt"},{"url":null,"title":"natasha-purcell-class-worker-struck-off-for-lying-to-land-jobs-at-glasgow-school","story":"A TEACHING assistant who lied about her qualication three times to land jobs at an award-winning Glasgow school for children with severe learning disabilities has been struck off."},{"url":null,"title":"its-time-to-get-booking-your-next-christmas-party-venue","story":"Whether you can believe it or not, the time for festive planning is here.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"rocky start for mid argyll rfc in first round in scottish schools cup","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe team scheduled to play Mid Argyll Rugby Club#s under s in the first round of the Scottish Schools Cup pulled out on the morning of the game # but local school pupils saved the day.Duncanrig School should have played the Mid Argyll youngsters at Lochgilphead Joint Campus, but cancelled at the last minute.A team made up of Lochgilphead high, Tarbert Academy, Campbeltown Grammar and Islay high schools was quickly formed to play as South Argyll Schoolsfor this cup competition.Coach Lee Buckley said: ‘As the Islay school boys were already on the ferry over for the fixture, we decided to play a development game between the  SAS squad members at the joint campus.‘Everyone put in an amazing effort and this session could be key when the team plays Marr College in the second round of the cup.’The team also struggled to find a pitch to play another home game on recently as there are no suitable rugby pitches in Mid Argyll.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op. No. as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

And to stay calm.There are bonuses to being autistic, as Dean outlined. #Nobody experiences joy like an autistic.

Thankfully the ninth Duke, Arthur Charles Valerian Wellesley, has much less of a fight on his hands. His battle is to gain planning permission to add a fine conservatory to his listed country manor. Bardrochat House and estate lies deep in the Stinchar Valley just outside Colmonell.  But the big house came with a tacky plastic conservatory which was put in during the s. The Duke, now , and known as Charles, wants to flatten it and build an elegant stone replacement befitting of his house and surrounding shooting and fishing Dalreoch Estate. But he has to gain listed building consent first. Architect Luke Moloney said: “This relatively recent extension to the house is incongruous for its comparative lack of quality, in both detailing and materials, and has therefore deteriorated to a point where its continuing repair becomes uneconomical. “The existing conservatory, however, is of no such signicance, but rather detracts from and compromises the fine architectural quality of the rest of the house.” The new building is masonry, partly harled, and with simple stone dressings, to match the spirit and fabric of the main house. The report by the architect to South Ayrshire Council adds: “Metal windows, and patent glazing to the roof, continue the long traditions of the British domestic conservatory. Cast iron rainwater hoppers drain the roof.” The Duke also enjoys the title Marquess of Douro and is married to a Prussian Princess. Bardrochat had been home to generations of the McEwen family from  to  and was a secret haunt of Princess Margaret. Inside, the pile is noted for a galleried, timber led entrance hall with barrel vaulted ceiling. Decorative plaster ceilings to the music room and drawing room are particularly fine. The Duke’s younger brother Lord Richard Wellesley lives on the Knockdolian estate nearby. This was their maternal grandfather Douglas McConnel’s property. South Ayrshire Council will reach a decision later on whether to grant listed consent.

And the ‘hey presto’ thing of the past has moved on a bit. A young magician is climbing up the magicians’ ladder. Fraser Stokes, , has just ed from a convention in Southport run by the International Brotherhood of Magicians with two awards. He reckons he is the first Scot since  to win one of them – the giant Dittia Shield. Fraser, who lives in Straiton, said: “This shield is only ever given to someone who demonstrates excellence in manipulation and I am delighted. Manipulation is classed as the highly dexterous sleight of hand on stage.” It is a heady rise since performing his first magic ‘gig’ aged eight at Straiton Gala Day. Fraser admits: “I thought then it was a volume thing and I think I cleared Tam Shepherds trick shop in Glasgow of most of the stock. “I had three tables which took about half an hour to build. “Fortunately now the quality has gone up a bit and the quantity well down.” The former Carrick Academy pupil is now trying to make a full-time professional career from his magic shows on stage and at kids parties and is attending business courses to help market himself. And he has ed from Stockport with a real spring in his step. Fraser said: “There were world-class performers there including Richard Cadell from the Sooty Show and he said my technique was world-class. “Also the first European champion of magic, Dion, came to me to say ‘I love your work, your performance made me emotional’.”As a BA Hons Drama student and member of Ayr acting troupe Fib, Fraser enjoys putting some theatre into his act. He said: “Just doing tricks is not really that enthralling –I think the audience needs to be spellbound .”Dad David, mum Alison and elder brother Calum – who works with the UN in Thailand – have seen most of his work, from the faltering first steps at the kitchen table in Straiton, to real magic on stage. The family moved to the village from Barassie when he was eight. Fraser, a member of Kilmarnock Magic Circle, said: “I have always loved magic but it was  years ago I started serious practice. “For birthdays and Christmas I always asked for money for my visits to Tam Shepherds. “These days there are loads of actors but hardly any magicians so I really hope to make a full-time career out of it. “Theatrical magic is my speciality, not the sawing a woman in two stuff. “It is a challenge, but I work long and hard trying to master the moves for my cabaret acts and for the competitions.” One day Straiton Gala, next the Las Vegas strip, with a little magic of course.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsTheatre"},{"url":null,"title":"new property company mystery over","story":"NewsNew property company mystery over Ayr Station HotelMalaysian owners sets up new firm for \"buying and selling of own real estate\"ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStation Hotel Safety work continues \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new property company linked to the Station Hotel in Ayr has been set up.

Strictly Come Dancing has been watched by millions across the country since  with viewers voting for their favourite celebrity to be crowned winner. But before the television dance contest took over our Saturday night evening watch, viewers got their ballroom fix from the series Come Dancing, which later reformed becoming the follow-up show we know today as Strictly. Back when the show aired on and off on the BBC from  to , it featured professional contestants and not celebrities. Doonfoot’s Janet Stirling danced on the original Come Dancing series as a member of the West of Scotland formation team. Now the dance queen is displaying her gowns at a special showcase in the Carnegie Library in Ayr for fans of the series. Looking back on her time on the series, Janet relived her dancing days. She said: “We trained twice a week - on a Thursday evening and a Sunday afternoon for two and a half to three hours. “And the whole team met up to do that. “There was  in a team all dancing in unison.  “So the men had to keep in line with each other and when the girls went out to curtsy we all did that at the same time. “It was a bit nerve-wracking knowing that millions of people were watching you. “And you didn’t want to make a mistake because in a formation team,you did, you’d stick out like a sore thumb.” When Janet started to dance she was  years old and in her teenage years she achieved her bronze, silver, gold, British Medallion and Blue Ribband medals in ballroom. She then went into formation dancing on the series when she was , under the reign of trainer Jim Graham. The Jim Graham formation team were Scottish Champions for three years and represented Scotland at the British Open Amateur Championships in Blackpool until the team disbanded when Jim emigrated to Canada. And the ballroom beauty even met her late husband through the art of dance. Janet said: “George and I were actually dancing at that same time. And that was how we met. “I was dancing with the team at the Albert Ballroom in Glasgow, which is no longer there, and he walked up and spoke to me. “It wasn’t very often you got chatted up by a man in white bow tie and tails.”  Although George never danced on TV, he was Janet’s partner when the pair competed together in amateur competitions. And she even learned a new style to compete alongside her love. She added: “I remember we were also having private lessons because he had done Ballroom and Latin American but I didn’t know anything about Latin American so we went for lessons so we could compete in the Latin American status as well.” Janet remembers nervously waiting for her team to appear on television, as the formation dancers were the last to feature. She said: “In the original Come Dancing there was a modern ballroom section, where somebody danced the Waltz or the Foxtrot or Tango. “And then there was a Latin American section and they either did the Cha Cha, Rumba or another dance. “The Jive was in the off-beat section and that got points as well. “And then the formation team were the last to go on. “Now they don’t do it that way. “But we were dancing against maybe north east England or south of England, and they were filmed in their ballroom and we were filmed in the La Cava in Glasgow. “The dresses that I wore were the team dresses but when the team was disbanded nobody said ‘give us them back’ or whatever as the trainer went to Canada.”  Now the dancer will display a few of her dresses for fans of the original series or for those with the Strictly fever. On display will also be Janet’s yellow dresswhich she wore when she danced as an amateur with husband George. “There’s a wee bit of history to that dress,” said Janet. “My formation team trainer Jim Graham was actually the Scottish Open professional champion in Ballroom. “And he and his we May competed and that was May’s dress so I bought it from her. Looking back on her time on the series, Janet added: “There’s a lot more dress than flesh in these days. “They were big and puffy and layers and layers of net and jewelled skirt. “Now when you watch it, although I enjoy it, they’ve not got much dress on! “I think I preferred it my way but I suppose that’s natural. Janet admitted Ballroom was always her favourite style of dancing, and she was sad when the Come Dancing series had come to an end. She added: “I missed it but I still enjoy watching it.” You can view Janet’s dresses at the Carnegie Library until October .

Auditors said using up reserves was sustainable in the short-term. However they warned the council only to reach for reserves within recommended levels.

Auditors said the council had strong budget setting and financial monitoring processes robust enough to achieve financial targets despite challenges. Independent councillor Alec Clark said: “Overall this report shows the good work done by the council.” He added: “I want to congratulate the team.”  He told the auditors the council is hampered in devising a long-term strategy as it relies on Scottish Government funding, which is dficult to predict.

Cruel yobs smashed the front window of hair and beauty salon Head Kandi on Dalrymple Street. But after recent news that CCTV cameras are in working order, salon owner Claire Taylor was told the opposite - meaning the heartless vandals may get away with it. And now she is calling for action. Claire, , told the Post: “The police woke me up at three in the morning and said “your windows been smashed in”. “I was in shock. “The police told me it happened between am and am and it was a traffic cone that got put through it. “The cone was further down the street so somebody’s lted it and brought it up. “And they told us that CCTV, there’s one right at the corner, doesn’t work. “I’ve heard from people in the town that they have been going from shop to shop for their CCTV in hopes that one has picked it up.  “Luckily it was only a smashed window but something really serious could have happened and there’s no CCTV in the town to pick it up.” The salon owner has only recently moved to her new salon, having been open less than two months. Claire added: “We’ve actually only been open six weeks as I just moved premises. “I’ve spent the past four months doing it up and then this happens. “I was pretty gutted. “A couple of weeks ago when previous vandalism happened, everyone said “oh aren’t you lucky it wasn’t yours” and then that happens. “We had shutters on the windows but took them off because they were damaged when we got the property. “And everyone kept saying “oh you should get shutters back up”, but I thought in this day and age nobody smashes windows  “And how wrong was I. “I definitely would like to see them get punished and fined to teach them a lesson. “They can’t go round and do that.  “And the time and money that’s went in- they should be punished for that.” Now the business owner of eight years is calling for proper working CCTV. She added: “But the camera situation definitely needs something done about it. “It’s  now, we should have some sort of better technology. “A couple of weeks ago councillors confirmed the CCTV does work but the police told me it doesn’t - so we’re unsure what the issue is. “We’ve now went and arranged to get CCTV put in the shop ourselves in case of further vandalism, but we shouldn’t really need to do that.” A Police spokesman commented: “Police Scotland received a report of a vandalism to a business property in Dalrymple Street, Girvan during the early hours of Saturday, September . “PC Munro of Girvan Response policing team is conducting robust enquires into the matter. “Anyone with information is requested to contact  and quote incident number  of September ”.

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.Irsquom ashamed about that ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

We will not outspend him with reckless borrowing, we will not promise the illusory utopia he offers because, as those who have tried it have shown time and time again, it is based on a lie and it always ends in tears.\"He explained how no one should mistake the Conservative belief in evolution over revolution for a lack of passion or commitment to change, to a paucity of values or ideals.ldquoThroughout history, Conservative governments from Peel to Disraeli to Thatcher have delivered momentous change, drawing on our values that have stood the test of time.ldquoThe importance of family and community the strength of our nation, united by history, culture and identity standing strong as a force for good in the world the insight that economic freedom goes hand in hand with political freedom and, above all, the belief in the power of enterprise as the route to unleash talent and to improve lives.ldquoThat is why we back business, declared the Chancellor. ldquoWe back business as the cornerstone of a successful economy, as a force for good in our society and as an essential expression of our values.ldquoSo just in case anyone, anywhere, was in any doubt at all, let me say it, loud and clear: the Conservative Party is, and always will be, the party of business.Elsewhere in his speech, Mr Hammond threatened internet giants with a new digital services tax to ensure they paid their fair share of the cost of public services.He stressed that, with international talks stalling, Britain was ready to go it alone with a levy on the tech companies.The measure formed part of a programme to \"regenerate capitalism\" which the Chancellor said was needed to tackle the challenges of the modern world and renew the appeal of the free market to a new generation.\"The best way to tax international companies is through international agreement,\" explained Mr Hammond.\"But the time for talking is coming to an end and the stalling has to stop.

Cue a couple of decisions from the Court of Session and the current administration has been left staring down the barrel of a multi-million-pound liability that should have been settled years ago.The problem is that the longer the issue has been allowed to fester the bigger that liability has become and the authority appears to be at a loss as to how to deal with it. Though council leader Susan Aitken committed in January to agreeing a settlement this year, so far nothing has been forthcoming, with the womenrsquos legal and trade union representatives accusing the council of burying its head in the sand over even the most basic of issues.Unsurprisingly, the women are irate, and those who are members of the Unison and GMB trade unions are preparing for strike action that could see key cleaning, caring and cooking services in the city grind to a halt in the coming weeks. Yet while their anger is understandable and their cause is deserving of support, the prospect of the strike is worrying precisely because of what it is designed to achieve.All industrial action has an end point in sight, whether it be to increase wages or protect existing rights, and the end point for the Glasgow strikers is to force an immediate settlement of these long-overdue claims. The problem is,Glasgow settles now it is likely to open itself up to further claims of discrimination in the future, with the perfect storm of its discredited pay structure and its obligations under pensions legislation putting any woman approaching retirement at risk.A  update to local government pension rules means that pension contributions must be paid on all equal-pay settlements. Yet because pensions are calculated based on salary, any claimant retiring before Glasgow replaces its pay scheme - something it has committed to do, but which could take years to complete - will have paid extra into the Strathclyde fund without the guarantee of receiving the correct pension in .No wonder Glasgow is baulking at the prospect of brokering a deal. Nor is it the only local authority to freeze in the face of its pension obligations, with the Herald on Sunday revealing at the weekend that councils across the country are playing fast and loose with the pensions legislation, to the degree that some are complying with it while some are merely thinking about it and others are ignoring it altogether.The end result is that women are being discriminated against simply because of the area they chose to live and work in, with an equal-pay cleaner in Dumfries and Galloway getting her pension rerated long before the law was changed to say that was her right while her counterpart in Argyll  Bute has effectively been told to whistle.And so, while some councils grapple with what should be a simple concept, the women who help keep this country going with their daily graft are being left to suffer the consequences. Indeed, while it seems clear that Glasgow City Council has neither the means nor the wherewithal to give its equal-pay women what they deserve, the scatter-gun approach councils in general are taking to observing their pension obligations is creating yet another layer of inequality. The fact that that layer lies between the very women that were discriminated against in the first place is beyond ironic - and beyond unacceptable.Which is why, far from taking their strike to the streets of Glasgow, the cityrsquos workers should be leading women from every part of the country in a march to the gates of Holyrood to demand the Scottish Government intervenes. Councils have had long enough to tinker around the edges of equal pay it is time a higher power took control to ensure unorm justice for all.Such action would likely be a success, too,recent history is anything to go by. Indeed, just last year First Minister Nicola Sturgeon cut short an official engagement in Germany to come to the aid of the male workers of troubled engineering firm BiFab after they took the fight for their livelihoods to the streets of Edinburgh. The Government handed over a total of pound million and helped broker the buyout of BiFab by Canadian firm JV Driver, even though the dire straits the business had been floundering in meant practically all the workers went on to lose their jobs anyway.Buthundreds of boiler-suited men marching on parliament can prompt such a reaction, just think what thousands of tabard-wearing women could achieve. Who knows, they might even be able to force the Government to sort this whole mess out in time for the th anniversary of the  Equal Pay Act.

This places Orkney third nationwide in terms of the highest empty property rates — behind Shetland and Western Isles specically.Councillor Rob Crichton, chair of the council#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: #Empty homes represent a signicant drain on rural communities, affecting their ability to rejuvenate and grow. They can, however, be utilised to directly counter the issues they once caused.#An empty home brought back into use as a primary residence represents another family in the community, potentially more children in local schools, and more money spent at local businesses.#The document is available at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C empty-homes-strategy-consultation.htm and is under consultation until Wednesday, October , at pm.Any comments should be submitted to Rachael Bowes, Empty Homes Development Officer via email rachael.bowes@orkney.gov.uk.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community councilrsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Streetallowed.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.Geordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the  game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a - win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.Hunter also played in the legendary - victory in Orkney  years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.Sinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and  in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late s and early s is something .From  to  he played in just over  matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.Sinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in , apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.Another who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented  wins in  matches, the only blip being a - draw in Orkney.Then he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.Len Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on  caps and how he went out on a high.But the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.That is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.: : : : : : : :Did the best team really win the World Cup  That question has been asked theand breadth of the country after France’s - victory over Croatia on Sunday.Personally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it - was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced. predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.France were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.As for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.After England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twitever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.A group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team  I don’t think so.It happened at the World Cups of , ,  and , and also at the European Championship in . I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.Speaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.There were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.My team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut CourtoisBenjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan StrinicIvan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden HazardCristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .If anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.: : : : : : : :Several metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.Among them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.England quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.MaybeShetland wins the Milne Cup th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street” Or did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen  raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parryfrom Gairloch, Ian MacLeodfrom Inverness, and -year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a LuckyBhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.On Saturday th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinleyI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead EnnisThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday th, September. Thousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.Sinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. “Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. “The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster. Such a move would require their MPs to swear an oath of allegiance to the reigning British monarch.Deputy Martin made the remarks after he was asked about the possibility of Fianna Fáil merging with the Social Democratic and Labour Partyto contest elections north of the border.Speaking to reporters in Malahide, Martin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.Before taking a seat in Wesminster, successful MPs must swear either an oath of allegiance or a solemn affirmation to “be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors”.In February, Fianna Fáil held an event to honour Constance Markievicz who  years previously became the first woman MP when she was elected to Westminster as the Sinn Féin MP for the St Patrick’s ward of Dublin.

We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”Meanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June  showed that % of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only % opposed.  When supporters were asked how they would reactSinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporterssaid they would oppose such a move.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagleWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.- Matt Carthy MEPSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. The Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from am tomorrow. It will feature two  discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible anda unity referendum could be won. Panellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. The  discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. Speakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. It is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. Speaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan KearneyTheannual British-Irish Associationconference convened last weekend inOxford, England.At thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.OnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  TheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.TheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.The RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that partys purportedadherence to good governance’.IanPaisleys misconduct  discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.The DUPjust does not get it!Thatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.Yet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.Andeventhe British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.Inreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.They have already decided the party should notcontest the  local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home.

Speaking to the , she said: Along with my daughter, Donna we thought this would be a lovely little way of spreading some happiness and smiles to our friends and neighbours here at home.Its a great way to get people out of the house and to get them walking around the local area in search of little rocks of sunshine and then also to hide and leave their own creations for others.The craze has become popular with families, as many children and their parents are now actively creating these little gems and are keen to leave them for others. Rocks dont have to be hid, they can be left visible.There is no particular theme to the rocks, just bright colours and whatever little saying or phrase or words of wisdom that youd like to share.If you find a rock you are able to keep it or  move it for someone  to find.Doreen is keen for more rocks to appear. She said: Anyone can join in, all you need is a rock, some paint and a paintbrush and get creative!“Some people put our Facebook link Ballymena Rocks on the back and then you can take a picture and upload it to the site when you find a rock.The more people getting involved means that the idea can grow and can spread to other towns, maybe it will even spread around the world!There certainly has been alot of interest in it around the town with whole families joining in.Doreen is keen to organise an event where people can come together and decorate rocks, so watch this space for more information.In Ballymena the most likely places to find a rock is at the Peoples Park, Ecos Centre walk or around the town centre.Dont forget to upload a picture of a rockyou find one.Doreen concluded that she has heard many stories of how these little rocks have brought a smile to the face of many people just when they needed it most and pleaded for more people to become involved.Cmon Ballymena, help spread some happiness and get out and get active while youre doing it!

A spokesperson for Dromore Nursery said: “As outstanding early years educators, we aim to offer every child equality of opportunity, it has not always been easy to translate this aspiration into practice. However, it has been delivered through genuine commitment and a willingness to challenge the deep rooted, often unquestioned, attitudes, values and practices which can and do discriminate against some children and families. “It is not about ‘treating all children the same’.

People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later. People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”The Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October  at .am and pm.Rev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from pm to pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”On Saturday, October , a Harvest Praise Night with the New Irish Youth Choir will take place in the church at .pm."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"The Brain Injury Foundation is holding a series of local information evenings following the overwhelming reaction to a recent televison documentary.News,  ..Project to enhance emergency careA #million project is underway at Craigavon Area Hospital to enhance emergency care and help reduce overnight stays.

The centre has been part of the Upper Springfield since  but it has changed and developed since then. I came onboard around two years ago and the centre is really about addressing the physical and mental health needs of the area.”The Healthy Living Centre is one of many successful projects managed by the Upper Springfield Development Trustwith physical activity classes including boxercise, zumba, pilates and circuit classes running in Corpus Christi parish church hall throughout the week. “We are open to what people want to do,” added Rosie, “we have an extremely popular Couch to K initiative and we have armchair aerobics as well for those less abled.“We also offer a counselling service here, the space here is really utilised. We run a social ‘prescribing programme’ which is a popular concept offered by your GP so that instead of prescribing medication, for say anxiety or in some cases depression, they may refer you to your local healthy living centre and that is where we come in.“Our activities have been proven in many cases to have improved the mental health of a person in that they can talk on how the centre has improved their lives.”Rosie spoke of how community engagement has increased at the Whiterock community gardens and allotment site.“We do hope to see the Men’s Shed model on the gardens, it would be another development that would address a particular need as older men as a group can become socially isolated.“We have weekly walking groups that go up the Black Mountain, Cave Hill, Bog Meadows and our cycling group is also up and running. There is great scope.”Looking ahead to the autumn and winter months, Rosie said that the centre will be encouraging parents and carers to participate in their Health Promoting Homes programme which is “trying to change mindsets in terms of healthy living, which incorporates nutrition.”“The programme is all about promoting the home as a healthier place for the children who are living with parents or grandparents,” she went on.“People are realising the connection between good physical activity, good diet and the impact that it has on their own health.

After handing over  responses to the legacy consultation, we discussed how we supported the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement in full and the proper resourcing of the coronial inquest system and Office of Police Ombudsman.”“We also told Mr Flatt that we planned to gather even more responses before the close of the consultation on th of October, especially during the advice clinics we are running across Belfast on Saturday to support any citizens who wish to respond.“We were also keen to discuss how long after the consultation closes that our families will see the British state’s response to the consultation, its passing of appropriate legislation at Westminster, and the structures in place and working. Although we want to ensure that the work is done properly, unlike it was in the past, families have longer to wait for any prospect of truth and justice under the proposed mechanisms, so the proper resourcing of the legacy inquests and the Office of the Police Ombudsman could help begin the process now. Any other delay will see the families of the Time for Truth campaign take to the streets as we did in February of this year when  victims and survivors, friends and supporters joined our March for Truth.” "},{"url":null,"title":"a long drive home for armagh familys","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

One user joked it would soon be quicker to drive to Dublin than get through the airports security.Its thought bottlenecks occur because of people arriving at the airport too early for their flight while others show up at the advised time leading to more passengers than expected arriving at one time. The airport took to the social network to remind people to arrive at least two hours before departure.\"Carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security,\" it tweeted.A spokeswoman added: \"We apologise to any passengers who suffered delays as a result of queues at security this morning.

It was not like it was going slow, it was just the sheer volume of people trying to get through.\"And by the time I got through it all the queue was just the same . It was a nightmare.\"He added: \"We went away for our holidays in the summer and had a  minute queue then. But you expect that over the Twelfth fortnight not at the beginning of October when it is mainly just commuters.\"The thing that really got me today was there was no one giving advice or even helping people who were about to miss their flights. There were some asking to get past to catch a flight and people were letting them through, but there needed to be better assistance.\"\"Had I missed my flight I would have missed important meetings today.\"The airport pledged to end long delays after it announced a new company would be taking over the handling of security. Wilson James will take over security operations on November .Belfast International Airport urged passengers to be prepared for security checks before arriving at the airport to speed the process along.\"Adhering to these guidelines and carrying only essential items in hand luggage can help reduce the need for manual checks at security, which can quickly cause queues to build up,\" the spokeswoman added.The airports guidelines include: Ensuring hand luggage is not densely packedAll non-essential liquids are packed in hold baggageAny liquids brought through security must be in a l resealable plastic bag All laptops, tablets etc must be removed from  hand luggage Remove all coats, belts etc"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit did dup mp say build irish border as high as you like","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Unfortunately, by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.As the leboat made herjourney to Newcastle and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.Theto Newcastle was another hazardous journey as the crew battled mountainous seas, forcing the vessel to stop at Ardglass marina for an hour to allow the storm force wind to ease and the waves to decrease. The leboat left the marina at pm, ing home one hour later.ldquoThis was a challenging day for our volunteers given that we launched into rough seas when Storm Ali was at its worst, said Coxswain William Chambers when safely back ashore. ldquoOur volunteers are highly skilled and trained for these situations and were delighted to be able to help.Some of the largest trees to fall victim to last weekendrsquos storm have been a prominent landmark in Castlewellanrsquos Lower Square for generations.Slieve Croob councillor Roiacutesiacuten Howell believes the location of the fallen trees should be the future home of the townrsquos permanent Christmas tree.ldquoLike many other residents who have grown up in the area their whole le, I was saddened to see these two great trees blow down. In many ways, they were local landmarks that were an iconic part of the heritage of our market town, standing for well over two hundred years, she said.ldquoI have proposed that the local council should consider placing Castlewellanrsquos new permanent live Christmas tree at this location. This would be a permanent feature all year round and save the council thousands of pounds every year.Cllr Howell added: ldquoThis idea is still a very early proposal, but as Castlewellan is one of seven towns within the district to have been chosen to have a live Christmas tree, I feel council officials should consider it as a good way of making use of this new space and will hopefully in time become our new local landmark..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tourism proposal showcased at Italian conference  ","story":"PROPOSALS to secure a world renowned tourism designation for an area stretching from Strangford Lough to South Armagh were outlined to  delegates at a prestigious international conference in Italy recently.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is seeking prestigious UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.A steering committee has been established to spearhead the bid which is in its very early stages, with the formal application to secure geopark status not expected to be submitted until November next year.Those behind the ambitious plan insist securing geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and, at the same time, trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.The emphasis moving forward is on partnership and engaging with local communities, with the steering group keen to talk to as many people as possible. The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.Senior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.During the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Irelandpresented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.Local authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent  to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.In addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.Since March last year, the local authorityrsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy.The current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.However, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8745087.jpg","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper StrattonTHE.

Evenyou didnrsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. Itrsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.Thatrsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.Irsquod say that you canrsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.Itrsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really donrsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I donrsquot think theyrsquore going about it in the best way.If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as yoursquore passing.If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to seethere are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isnrsquot going to do me much good.A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isnrsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the storersquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where theyrsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.We wouldnrsquot have had the ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that therersquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go therethey donrsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast arenrsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but itrsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, wersquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so therersquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses canrsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. Itrsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.If Translink brought back opentickets, Irsquom sure wersquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesnrsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Everybody was widely aware of this – but this was accepted.”He said that tarfs in GB – where there were cost controls to stop unlimited burning – were also higher than the cost of fuel to speed uptake.Stormont’s Department for the Economy has told the inquiry that those who knew that the subsidy was higher than the cost of fuel did not alert it to that fact. It described this as a “conspiracy of silence”.Mr Hegan said: “I say that’s a similar argument to saying [major gas suppliers] firmus and Phoenix Natural Gas have a conspiracy of silence that they’re not telling the department what price natural gas is...there’s no conspiracy of silence as to the price of pellets.“As several people have alluded to, Google’s a wonderful thingthey don’t know. But I’m actually astounded –this is true – that the energy department in [Stormont] would not know the price of fuel on a scheme that they’re rolling out. It’s the equivalent of saying ‘we don’t know what price diesel is we don’t know what price petrol is’.”Mr Hegan said that he never thought to tell officials about the price of biomass fuel because he believed “this was government policy”, adding: “This was seen as a certied upright government scheme...I was under the illusion, shall we say, that there’s people a lot more qualied and a lot more intelligent than I was that had made these decisions and we were out there as a business to implement this.”He said that he would have seemed “a fool”he had pointed out to civil servants what price biomass fuel was, adding: “It would be like me ringing up the department at the minute and saying ‘do you know what price mains gas is ’“I can’t fathom that they wouldn’t understand the price of pellets in a scheme that they’re rolling out - this is a £m, £m scheme and they don’t know what price the fuel is  It can’t be right.”In his written evidence, Mr Hegan said: “It is my steadfast opinion that DETI was aware but chose to ignore the issues, in their quest to roll out the programme.”Sir Patrick put to him the evidence of an energy expert who told the inquiry that energy efficient systems were unattractive because the kwh boilers were so lucrative, with no limits on what could be earned. Mr Hegan said: “Yeah. Well, it was the way in which the scheme was designed [which] led to the proleration of kwh boilers.”Sir Patrick asked: “Why do you think it took so long for that to dawn on the people who designed the scheme ” After a y pause, Mr Hegan said: “I believe they knew.”Sir Patrick said: “If you believe they knew, what do you think the motive was to have a scheme that was extremely monetarily attractive – [that] offered you a profit as opposed to an incentive – what was the motive for that as opposed to one that incentivised an energy effective solution ”Mr Hegan said he believed it was deliberately designed to be ultra-attractive to encourage uptake, as is common with green energy incentives, but that a key flaw had been the failure cut that rate as uptake quickened.

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

However in business, things are really moving and the way we do business is evolving at a breath-taking pace.The biggest change we’re seeing is in all things digital. We now adopt new technology quickly and easily because developers are getting better at using a human-first approach to make complex things intuitive. Take contactless payments.Remember how the first few times you waved your debit card at a machine, it was a bit scary and surreal. We’ve rapidly become accustomed to contactless payments and things like Apple Pay. This once futuristic stuff is now common place and it is really transforming how companies transact.Along with these complex advances come the obvious threats of cyber security, the potentially ransomable value of inidual or company data post-GDPR, and the competitive market risks to businesses which aren’t already on their digital game.While we’re seeing a burgeoning community of tech start-ups through both our own Eagle Lab at Ormeau Baths and a growing number of incubator hubs in Belfast and Derry, as well as impressive numbers of IT jobs created from inward investment, it’s never too late to begin your digital transformation. The thing is,you’re a tech firm, your financial tech needs to be walking the walk too. Increasingly, we’re finding clients placing more emphasis on this in their choice of banking partner, above all .Barclays was the first bank to develop an ATM over  years ago, and the first UK bank to launch a credit card. In more recent years we were among the first to launch contactless cards, and we were the first bank in Northern Ireland to make cheque imaging available to our clients. In the past  years we’ve invested over £bn in new technology which has meant our clients can be sure our digital technology is right up to date. While other banks are now facing a catch-up period of investment and the challenges of upgrading their s, Barclays has the technology already in place. Our personal banking app was recently voted best in the UK, and our small business  allows businesses to access a pre-approved overdraft limit at the touch of a button.  Our award-winning corporate cash management system, Barclays.net, is tried and tested by the % of UK companies which put it through its paces every day.BEYOND NI: EXPORTS AND CONNECTIONS The spotlight is being turned on Northern Ireland’s exporting capabilities, brought into sharper focus by the issue of Brexit. Without doubt, export sales are one of the key opportunities for growing the economy. We are really excited to work with established export businesses like Moy Park at one end of the spectrum and a successful new tech business, Neurovalens, at the other. This start-up began le as one of the first tenants in the Barclays Eagle Lab at Ormeau Baths and due to growth, has recently moved into its own premises to accommodate its now more than  staff.While access to money is obviously important for business growth, access to our networks can be just as valuable for NI companies. With Barclays’ major presence in the UK and US, our London and New York private equity contacts are opening doors for Northern Ireland firms looking for market intelligence.This style of partnership working with a local banking team, which can link into a well-established international network, is exactly the foot up our companies need to make them competitive in a global economy.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"justin rush taking pride in recruitment","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Anyone that attended the  Belfast Pride Festival would have been bowled over by the number of participants in the parade, the huge crowds of well-wishers who assembled, and the sizeable number and range of employers supporting the event. It was great to see so many people unite and support the importance of ersity and inclusion, themes that are central to successful recruitment strategies. Perhaps, those of us who are in business can learn a lesson from the organisations, that quite literally, lead the way on the day in the parade. Prominent firms such as Danske Bank, Allen  Overy, EY and FinTrU were out in force at Pride. Leaders within these organisations truly value being seen as ethical, fair and engaged employers. They know that all their staff expect to be able to bring their ‘true’ selves to work. And of course, when people are happy in work they are productive, so it makes total sense. When it comes to the attraction of new talent to an organisation, we should think hard about how we position ourselves as inclusive, especiallythe intention is to appoint millennials. A recent statistic, published by YouGov and referenced by Fergal McFerran of Stonewall, at the Powered By Talent conference stated that “% of  to  year olds now identy as something other than % heterosexual”. Employers should derive two items from this statistic straight away. Firstly, it is highly likely your organisation has LGBT staff employed within. Secondly, employers seeking to recruit, must be seen to welcome potential candidates from all avenues, failure to do so could mean a signicant reduction in applications. Here are some steps to ensure that your organisation, is doing everything it can, to attract recruits from the LGBT community: Dedicate web and social media pages, that hold specic LGBT inclusive content. This simple measure says lots about company culture and openness. LGBT equality, include a statement of commitment when advertising jobs on-line. Ensure confidentiality and fairness. Train recruitment teams, focus on removing any unintentional bias, do your teams know why it is so important to be inclusive  Use proudemployers.org.uk, to advertise your jobs to the UK and Ireland LGBT audience. Join the parade, get involved in LGBT community events, nothing will say you are an inclusive employer more. If your organisation is welcoming of ersity, strives for inclusion and is visible in doing so, congratulations. Unfortunately, here in Northern Ireland many organisations are still not thinking widely enough in definition. Those organisations need to establishtheir agreed policies are indeed active practice. If you feel your organisation would benefit from being more visible and more inclusive, visit www.stonewall.org.uk ersity-champions-programme Justin Rush is director at Belfast-based Abacus Group.

A planning application, made by PWD Developments, is seeking to create a mixed use development, which will incorporate two ground floor units and eight apartments.The proposed scheme would involve the demolition of the two-storey building to make way for the new three-storey project.The building sits across the The Pavilion and Errigle bars, was put on the market last year with a price tag of around £,.The proposed building design has been developed to improve the streetscape, and according to the architects, offers a clean, crisp and modern interpretation of a traditional design.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Foyle.jpg","title":"foyle port posts record turnover of m","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Foyle Port has posted record turnover of £.m while pre-tax profits now sit at £.m. Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners reported a record turnover of £.m for the year to March , . The % rise over the year means turnover at the port has trebled in  years. Pre-tax profits were down % year-on-year, dropping from £m to £.m. Foyle Port chief executive, Brian McGrath, said: “The outstanding corporate performance of the organisation, year on year, demonstrates the in-depth strength of our operational team.” “The port’s location at Lisahally underpins our key position as an Atlantic gateway for the United Kingdom and Europe. Furthermore, the port’s operations straddle both British and Irish jurisdictions.” And Foyle Port chairman, Bonnie Anley, said since “the launch of our new strategy, our performance has outstripped targets and the port business has continued to grow. “This model has increased our resilience and put Foyle Port on a strong footing to meet any challenges that lie ahead.” “As we move closer towards Britain’s exit from the European Union we will need to navigate change and uncertainty, both locally and nationally.” “Our strong business model, coupled with our dedicated port team, leave me in no doubt that Foyle Port has the flexibility needed to adapt to a new commercial context and the innovation needed to capitalise on all new opportunities arising in the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Leader-web.jpg","title":"leader of the house addresses top  companies gala event","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business The EU should \"come to the table and start taking our Chequers proposals very seriously\" the Leader of the House of Commons has told a top business event in Belfast. The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies dinner, with sponsor AL Goodbody, saw dozens of those making the list attend a grand gala dinner at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. They heard from guest speaker Andrea Leadsom, who restated the Governments commitment to no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and its determination to not have any customs border between NI and the rest of the UK. \"I am fully aware of your concerns as business leaders in relation to Brexit, particularly in relation to the border,\" she told her audience at the Ulster Museum. \"I know the success of many of your businesses, and your day-to-day lives, relies on frictionless trade and travel across the border. Let me assure you that we dont want this arrangement to change when we leave the EU.” The event also heard from Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew, who said companies across Northern Ireland were exhausted due to the deadlock at Stormont, and remain concerned over what damage a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario could have on their bottom line. “It’s quite clear that anything that leaves us with a ‘no deal’ scenari, in simplistic terms, is not going to work, or be acceptable to you, and thousands of other businesses across Northern Ireland,” he said. And speaking about the lack of an Executive, he said: “Everyone here knows it’s not acceptable. Everyone here is tired talking about it, and wants it sorted now, rather than when it’s convenient for those who are supposed to be here to govern us.” Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said that since the Top  two years ago, little had progressed in how Brexit would be dealt with. “We would all have hoped that by now we would have some sense of what the future business environment might look like. But, sadly, that is not the case. “Every day at AL Goodbody, we’re getting calls from companies of all sizes, right across the Island of Ireland and beyond who are seeking some sense of clarity on Brexit-related legal matters. “That means, every single day, we hear that NI Plc is still grappling with that same ‘great unknown’ Mark spoke of at this event two years ago. \"And when you add to this the political deadlock and over  days without a local government, its no wonder our clients and the wider business community find ourselves in a very challenging situation.” The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies magazine is the leading list of the region’s top businesses, ranked by turnover. Overall, pre-tax profits among those making the list grew by %, rising to £.m And turnover among the Top  increased by %, to just shy of £bn. Moy Park kept the top spot, for the seventh year running, with turnover of £.bn. And since publication, that turnover has grown further still.

For reference, this is one of probably more than a dozen trips I’ve paid to the country in the last decade.Antwerp is an accessible port city, known for its diamond quarter. Its main train station is also something to behold. Listed as one of the world’s most beautul stations, it fuses century-old architecture with grand ceilings, along with its multi-storey renovation in .The main town squares in Belgium’s northern cities each have a familiar style, with Antwerp’s Grote Markt akin to the capital’s larger Grand-Place. These spots are worth a dander around on a hot day, but expect to pay tourist prices at the raft of outside eateries which scatter the perimeter.Temperatures in Belgium tend to fall in line with the south of England – a warmer climate than Northern Ireland, with the mercury hitting the late s during the summer.On this latest trip, it was a high of C and a low of a little over -odd at night. Scorching, but with a crisp Belgian strong pale ale in hand, that’s all made right .In Antwerp, and Brussels, you’ll find a raft of beers from the six Belgian Trappist monasteries – highlights include Rochefort , Westmalle Tripel and the highly sought-after Westvleteren  –  and those from the more-modern producers, such as Brussels Beer Project and De Struise, fairly readily across the capital, and the surrounding areas.Frites Atelier is a popular spot for high-end Belgian frites, topped with items such as truffle mayonnaise, Indonesian peanut sauce and a stunning traditional Flemish stew. It’s normally bunged, but the system ensures you aren’t waiting long – and it’s definitely worth the visit.One of Belgium’s beer-known beer spots can also be found a short distance from the city centre. The Kulminator is a somewhat eccentric spot, run by a husband and we team. It has a traditional brown cafe feel, cluttered, but has the most extensive range of aged Belgian beers I’ve come across. To continue the beer theme, we headed to the small town of Lot – before heading on to Brussels for the rest of the stay.It’s home to Drie Fonteinen – one of Belgium’s most-revered sour beer producers and blenders. A couple of hours well spent with one-off brews and vintage offerings, paired with a platter of beer pate, cheese, bread and pottekeis – a fresh cheese spread, somewhere between a smooth cottage cheese and sour cream. Now, in Brussels there are more than a few great spots for both a wide-range of top-end Belgian brews, and a warm atmosphere.The central La Mort Subite is a grand cafe located close to Grand-Place, with a solid range of beer, while Delirium Cafe – known for having the largest selection of beer in the world – is worth a visit. If you’re going as a beer geek, peruse the vast ,+ bottle range and find something you can’t get back home, but be aware than it’s become a tourist mecca – with backpacking students filling it in the busy periods to get a filter-clad snap for their timeline.Moeder Lambic has two spots – one central and one further south. Both are superb, modern Belgian beer bars, with a strong tap selection and the best meat and cheese board in the city.Brussels has a couple of breweries in its city centre, but Cantillon is the place to visit for those who are either fully immersed in beer, or want to expand their palate.You can also eat well in Brussels, with lots of spots serving good meat, cheese and pate, with bistro fare such as Flemish carbonnade and rabbit cooked in gueuze beer. There’s also an undercurrent of ‘all-you-can-eat’ rib appreciation, with Amadeo – and similar spots in other cities such as Ghent. We also opted for the beer-friendly and cosy Nuetnigenough. Starters and mains include black pudding with gueuze beer sauce, veal meatballs and rabbit fricassee with gueuze.For seafood, the bustling outdoor Noordzee is a great place to stop off for very fresh mussels, prawns and crab.It’s dficult to know whether the city’s reasonable hotel prices, and flight costs –booked far enough in advance – are in part due to the terror attacks in . But Brussels is a city moving on from that particularly dark period in its modern history.We stayed at the five-star pole – a grand Art Deco hotel with spacious rooms. On this occasion we paid little over £ a night.Aside from places to eat and drink, the city centre is a very walkable place – it’s the sort of place that merits exploration. The city also boasts a thriving jazz centre, and it’s worth checking online to see what’s happening during your stay.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete.jpg","title":"meat merchant to expand into republic","story":"Posted on Monday October  by John Mulgrew Meat mogul Peter Hannan says he will expand the retail arm of his successful Co Down business into the Republic this year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Kildare-born businessman, who runs Hannan Meats in Moira, also believes that, following the negative outlook for the economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit, that the UK’s exit from the EU won’t happen.In an interview with Ulster Business, Mr Hannan said: “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises. The fit-out specialist is seldom out of the headlines, whether it’s landed new contracts or winning awards. The company has ersied and grown in influence, with Mr McConville one of just two Northern Ireland business leaders joining Prime Minister Theresa May on an international trade mission to China.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
