If you get the injection, your arm may be sore, too, or you might experience a slight fever or aching muscles for a day or two afterwards. Serious side effects with both the jab and nasal spray are extremely rare.HOW WILL MY CHILD BE VACCINATED AGAINST FLU?Most children will be vaccinated at school, but those who have not started yet, or who are in a high-risk group, can also get it from their GP.I\u0027M PREGNANT – IS IT SAFE TO GET THE COVID AND FLU JABS?Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it\u0027s important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":null,"title":"Coming soon UK cinema screen near French horror film graphic FAINTED","story":"Share this article       But others were not as receptive to it. The Guardian called it a \u0027car crash\u0027 because of its \u0027sheer silliness and towering pointlessness\u0027, French paper Liberation said the storyline was \u0027pretty much inarticulate\u0027 and Switzerland\u0027s Le Temps wondered what the film-maker had meant by her \u0027pretentious\u0027 offering. While some felt let down by the French director - whose cannibalistic debut \u0027Raw\u0027 delighted critics a few years ago - others gave her full marks.\u0027Ducournau breaks all the rules, to our greatest pleasure,\u0027 gushed French magazine Les Inrockuptibles. \u0027Her furious film is like no other.\u0027The director herself said she felt \u0027a lot of anger\u0027 while writing the film.\u0027Trump had just been elected, and the world was not a happy place,\u0027 she told AFP in an interview.\u0027I was very pessimistic about the future and about a society that has no room for fluidity, transformation, for change and inclusiveness,\u0027 she said, adding: \u0027There was also a desire for metal and skin that I can\u0027t really explain.\u0027 Pedestrian TV - Latest News in Celebrities, Movies, TV and Music"},{"url":null,"title":"A piano owned rock band Queen set fetch 20 000 auction Corsham Wiltshire","story":"Share this article That was Queen\u0027s final tour with Mercury and bass player John Deacon, and it is estimated that more than one million people attended the 26 concerts.The auction will take place at Gardiner Houlgate in Corsham, Wiltshire, on December 8.Auctioneer Luke Hobbs said: \u0027This is an incredible piece of rock memorabilia and a fantastic instrument.\u0027With new technology, today\u0027s electric pianos are a fraction of the size of the Kawai.

Morrison criticised the Ulster Unionist party minister after the last-minute cancellation of his show. Video of the incident went viral after Morrison called the Democratic Unionist MP Ian Paisley on to the stage to join him in chants. Paisley has since described it as “parody” and said he did not believe Swann was dangerous. Four gigs scheduled by Morrison, including one at the Europa hotel, were cancelled at the 11th hour as live music was still not permitted under Covid restrictions. The management of the hotel blamed confusion by Stormont ministers for the late notice, believing they had been given the green light to proceed. A few weeks later, Morrison said he would challenge the Northern Irish government in court over its “blanket ban” on live music in licensed venues. According to reports, Swann began defamation proceedings earlier this year that also cite two subsequent incidents when the singer elaborated on his views on Swann. Prime minister Boris Johnson said the milestone was “amazing” as he warned boosters will be “vital” to keep “you and your loved ones protected through the winter”. In total, 10,062,704 people in the UK have received a top-up jab, according to the government, with 409,663 receiving one on Saturday. See below for the full story. NHS figures for Sunday showed that 10,062,704 people in the UK had received a booster jab, or third shots for those with weakened immune systems, with the number in England reaching 8.5 million. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, urged people to take up the offer of booster shots when they became eligible, describing the push as a “national mission” that would help the country “avoid a return to restrictions and enjoy Christmas”.

However, some countries in eastern Europe are experiencing record outbreaks. Even though the spread has slowed, the virus is still infecting 50 million people every 90 days due to the highly transmissible Delta variant, the analysis showed. It took nearly a year to record the first 50 million Covid cases. Health experts are optimistic that many nations have put the worst of the pandemic behind them thanks to vaccines and natural exposure, although they caution that colder weather and upcoming holiday gatherings could increase cases. “We think between now and the end of 2022, this is the point where we get control over this virus ... where we can significantly reduce severe disease and death,” Maria Van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist leading the World Health Organisation, told Reuters.Stay tuned for more coronavirus news as it comes this evening and, of course, feel free to tweet me @tomambrose89.It reported 5,822 new infections, down from 6,764 a day earlier. With 4.81 million cases to date, Italy has registered 132,391 deaths linked to Covid since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain, and the ninth-highest in the world. The number of patients in hospital with Covid – not including those in intensive care – stood at 3,215 on Sunday, up from 3,173 a day earlier. There were 26 new admissions to intensive care units, compared with 23 on Saturday. The total number of intensive care patients rose slightly to 398 from a previous 392.

Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have been 166,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate. As of 9am on Sunday, there had been a further 30,305 lab-confirmed Covid cases in the UK, the government said.The Department of Health said there had also been another 1,035 positive cases of the virus confirmed in the last 24-hour reporting period.In the north-western town of Banja Luka, staff at the Covid-19 ward of the city’s main hospital warned that hospitalisations had increased in the past days and could explode soon, AP reported. Out of the hospital’s 300-bed capacity for Covid-19 patients, 223 were already filled on Friday, including 32 in intensive care. On Saturday, reports emerged that Bosnia’s only certified medicinal oxygen filling plant has been forced to close due to severe flash flooding, which caused power outages in most of the capital of Sarajevo. The oxygen plant is crucial for the treatment of the country’s seriously ill Covid-19 patients, CGTN reported. Dr Nikki Kanani, NHS deputy vaccination programme lead and GP, said: The chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents England’s 240 NHS trusts, said the situation was unprecedented and “very worrying” as exhausted hospital staff prepare for higher levels of Covid and other respiratory infections such as influenza, while dealing with a backlog of care for patients. “What’s very, very striking in talking to our trust chief executives is how worried some of the very long term leaders, who’ve been around a long time, are at this point. What they are saying to us is they’ve never been so worried,” Chris Hopson told Times Radio on Sunday. Prof Dame Anne Johnson, president of Academy of Medical Sciences, was asked if the government was right to not go to plan B this winter.

But for all its long history here, Salvelinus alpinus remains, as in the title of a study for the Royal Irish Academy, “a secretive and threatened ice age relict”.To Google “charr” is to be offered pictures of giant trophy specimens straddling both arms of anglers, the fish’s big red belly (this only in breeding males) sagging between. Such monster specimens, up to 15 kilos, are caught in Canada’s northern lakes but still migrate to the sea for food. Ireland’s fish are now strictly dwellers in meagre trout lakes, feeding on zooplankton and occasionally each other.At mostly up to 30cm, they have sometimes been termed “freshwater herring” – an indication of the “low numbers of encounters between Irish char and humans today”, as the RIA paper put it. Written in 2014 by Fran Igoe and Swedish fishery expert Johan Hammar, it reinforced the appeal for conservation of char and the purity of deep, cold lake waters that are their vital retreat.Such pristine conditions are threatened by eutrophication, climate change and introduced predatory fish such as pike, and the past few decades have seen the extinction of entire populations. But in some lakes, says the RIA study, char may still actually outnumber the native trout.The survivors may soon get some protection from a bylaw prohibiting their catch. This proposal, sought from the Minister of Environment by Inland Fisheries Ireland and Fran Igoe’s Char Conservation Society, is now open to public consultation.The char’s persistence at the southernmost fringe of its natural range makes its gene pool one of the oldest in western Europe and thus of particular interest to evolutionary biologists.Such special histories mark others among the 1,000 Irish species considered “vulnerable”, “near threatened” or “in danger of extinction” in Red Lists for protection. These were drawn up for the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.The latest list of protected and threatened Irish species, published online (NPWS Wildlife Manual 116), took 10 scientists to compile, each a specialist in one branch of living nature. From seabirds and dolphins to dragonflies and lichens, the species were selected from an estimated 18,000-plus birds, animals, plants, fish and insects in the Republic alone.Many of the man-made threats to their existence are known and even measurable, but the vagaries and intensities of climate change have yet to be experienced. Floods, droughts and heat waves will all have impact, for example, on the near-invisible lives of water beetles, which are such a distinctive part of Ireland’s natural world.Until it sprang a leak and slowly sagged into a bog, my fabricated garden pond housed a host of water beetles. The largest and most fiercely carnivorous was the great ing beetle, which flies at night to avoid interception by birds. It is suggested that it looks for glints of reflected moonlight and has sometimes ended up in a water trough or flooded wheelbarrow.Its pursuit of frog tadpoles is shared by its offspring, a singularly sinister style of prawn. I include the great ing beetle in my drawing. This was made in response to an experimental Irish recording of the chirps and stridulations of underwater life, captured by a dangled hydrophone. So beetles, like whales, can share the language of submarine song.The study of Ireland’s water beetles has a long and dedicated history, revived in recent years by the discovery of new Irish species in the lakes of the Burren and elsewhere. Of some 240 known wetland species, almost 70 have been listed for Red List protection.Scientific names come first, but English common names follow in almost very case – the Bubblegum Diver and Bald-beaked Sloth Weevil among them. The one exception in the NPWS list is the ciarogínbán, presumably named by the science team sifting the beetles from Ireland hardwater limestone lakes.It discovered that Ireland holds most of the global population of Ochthebius nilssoni, a species never reported from Britain. This gives the country not only the right to award the beetle a native common name but also, as the team emphasises, “a responsibility to protect it”.Between 2006 and 2016, the ciarogínbán was found in five Burren lakes and later in Co Mayo’s Lough Carra. There, in Ireland’s most famously pristine and closely studied karst limestone lake, the flea-sized (1.6mm) beetle browses on a spongy, bright cream-yellow biofilm on rocks called krustenstein.A tiny Irish beetle in such a wild and whitish habitat does come together in a likely sort of Irish name, though krustensteinfloh might work well in certain foreign quarters."},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"contentious residential investor roadshows to go ahead","story":"Department of Finance officials have suggested Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien should attend an event for institutional investors, reassuring those alarmed by moves to limit bulk buying of properties.

It is expected that an event will take place in the new year. Earlier in 2021 the Government said it would move to ban investment funds and other institutional investors from bulk buying housing estates after it transpired that entire developments had been purchased by funds, squeezing out inidual homebuyers. It later introduced a special 10 per cent stamp duty on the purchase of 10 or more units.Sinn Féin reactsSinn Féin was fiercely critical of the plan for investor roadshows. “Now it has been revealed that both Ministers intend to go on a roadshow to reassure these very same investors that Ireland is open for business.

The European Union may set aside the free-trade agreement with the United Kingdom if London triggers article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol and suspends its operation, according to Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.Mr Coveney said the EU “would respond in a very serious way” if the UK invokes article 16 of the protocol, effectively putting on hold the operation agreement on Northern Ireland between the EU and the UK.He said the free-trade agreement between the two depends on the protocol being operated by London.“One is contingent on the other. So that if one is being set aside, there is a danger that the other will also be set aside by the EU,” Mr Coveney told RTÉ’s This Week programme. He said he hoped the dispute would not escalate into a trade war between the two, but that the EU would conclude that the UK is not operating in good faith if article 16 is invoked.He said he needed to be blunt in his warnings to London that suspension of the protocol would not be viewed as a minor issue by the EU. Mr Coveney added that the British government should not underestimate the impact in Brussels of triggering article 16.He said it is not a “technical issue” but would be seen in Brussels as “deliberately forcing a breakdown in relations and negotiations between the two sides”. Mr Coveney said it is “increasingly the view across the EU” that the British side is seeking to collapse negotiations. The British government, he said, is seeking to “rewrite the protocol entirely when they know that the EU can’t, and won’t, do that”.Ireland would act in concert with the rest of the European Union if London triggers article 16, he added. “This is bad faith if it happens,” said Mr Coveneyand would be damaging to relations between the EU and UK and London and Dublin, echoing Dáil comments by Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Wednesday. Mr Coveney also said that the move would damage relations between London and Washington. President Joe Biden has warned Britain repeatedly about actions that might damage the peace process in Northern Ireland.Mr Coveney said he was setting aside “the diplomatic language that I’m expected to use as a foreign minister” and would “be a bit more direct in relation to the consequences” of triggering article 16.“This would be a significant act that would damage relationships between Britain and Ireland, would put extraordinary pressure on parties in Northern Ireland also . . . Northern Ireland works when the British and Irish governments act in partnership and Northern Ireland doesn’t work when that isn’t happening.”At some point, said Mr Coveney, “the EU says enough, we are not negotiating with a partner here that is acting in good faith”.Community tiredTriggering Article 16 was the last thing the North needs as the region grapples with Brexit and the pandemic, said Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium. “The community here is tired,” he said. “We have Brexit fatigue, we have Protocol fatigue. We just want to make things work. “There is a health crisis. We are still in the middle of a global pandemic. There are cost rises on everything from groceries to fuel, and this is affecting everyone’s pocket. “So, what we don’t need is another headache by Article 16 being invoked or a long protracted negotiation period.” Mr Connolly said the business community and the community at large “needs to see this being resolved and resolved in a way that allows us to move goods without friction.” “We need stability, certainty, simplicity, and we need affordability,” he said. “Article 16 does not do that. It gives us more uncertainty, it gives us more instability and it gives us more negotiations.” Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald warned Britain is “playing a very dangerous game” in negotiations with the EU over the protocol. The UK government is playing a “game of chicken” with Brussels in which Ireland was the collateral damage, she said.Ms McDonald said she agreed with remarks over the weekend by former British prime minister John Major that suspending parts of the protocol would be dangerous and “colossally stupid”.“I would say furthermore it would demonstrate yet again colossal bad faith and demonstrate again that Ireland - the North of Ireland in particular - is collateral damage in the Tory Brexit as they play games and play a game of chicken with the European institutions,” she said. Speaking to the BBC’s Sunday Politics, Ms McDonald said “if the British government imagine that they hold all of the cards, they are wrong and they are playing a very dangerous game, up to and including jeopardising the entire Withdrawal Agreement.”Ms McDonald said the EU has demonstrated flexibility and good faith in negotiations and now the “ball is at the foot” of Boris Johnson. Britain needed to “act in good faith” and if it didn’t the “consequences could be grave,” she said. Ms McDonald accepted there were “issues with the Protocol” but said it was also necessary. Labour’s viewEarlier today British Labour leader Keir Starmer said suspending parts of Northern Ireland’s Brexit deal would not resolve the dispute between the UK and EU.Asked if he would support the government if it triggers article 16, the Labour leader told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “I don’t think that triggering article 16 will resolve the dispute in relation to the protocol in Northern Ireland. That isn’t in the interests of the communities . . . or businesses in Northern Ireland. What is in their interests is resolving the issues.“Because of the way the protocol was drafted, because of what the prime minister signed, it is perfectly true that there are checks from Great Britain to Northern Ireland – we want to reduce those.”He added: “What I am saying is don’t rip up the protocol because that has that very important central purpose, which is to protect the no Border in Northern Ireland.”On Saturday former British prime minister John Major said he warned Boris Johnson that suspending parts of Northern Ireland’s Brexit deal would be dangerous and “colossally stupid”. He said the move would damage relations with the European Union and the United States and could further destabilise Northern Ireland. – Additional reporting PA How is Brexit affecting you?

Photograph: Jim Lo ScalzoEPAIn Shakespeare, when characters want to fulfil their desires, they escape to what’s been called the Green World. And that’s what Democrats promised voters: that they could leave behind the vitriol and aggravation of Donald Trump’s America and escape to an Arden that was cool, calm and reassuring.Democrats violated that pledge. On the way to that verdant forest, we got led into a circular firing squad. Tight margins in Congress do not bring out the best in pols.“We promised to change the rancour and ision,” said one top Democrat. “So we offered something else: ision and rancour.”Many who were sick of Trump chaos and ineptitude are now sick of Biden chaos and ineptitude. Scranton Joe was supposed to be the sensible, steady one. After all, as Democrats are keenly aware, Trump lost the 2020 race as much as Biden won it. Only 44,000 votes in Arizona, Wisconsin and Georgia saved Biden from an Electoral College tie.And for a long time now, people have been watching the spectacle of Democrats grinding away at the sausage and fighting for their piece of the pie (to make a metaphoric meal). And it has not been a pretty picture.There’s some truth in what James Carville told Judy Woodruff: “What went wrong is this stupid wokeness. Don’t just look at Virginia and New Jersey. Look at Long Island, look at Buffalo, look at Minneapolis, even look at Seattle, Wash. I mean, this defund the police lunacy, this take Abraham Lincoln’s name off of schools.”There’s also some truth in what representative Abigail Spanberger, a moderate in a tough re-election battle, told the New York Times’s Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns about the president: “Nobody elected him to be FDR they elected him to be normal and stop the chaos.”Biden has pursued his two bills with Captain Ahab-like zeal he pines to be FDR and eclipse Barack Obama, who pushed him aside for Hillary Clinton. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi hail the bills as transformational. But what are you transforming into?The election cratering showed that such overweening efforts are putting off many voters who are still struggling just to get by as they move beyond the degradation wrought by Trump and Covid.While the Democrats wallow in a family food fight, Americans are still stressed and exhausted from the whole Covid ordeal, confronting high gas prices and stymied from getting the appliances and Christmas toys they want.“I used to advise mayors, you can be as visionary as you want, but just make sure you take the garbage out and fill the potholes,” said David Axelrod, who oversaw messaging for Obama.Republicans have not lost their talent for coming up with boogeymen to scare white voters, and thanks to a dumb comment by Terry McAuliffe in a debate, they have succeeded in turning parents’ rights in schools into a wedge issue.Some in the GOP see Glenn Youngkin as a template for moving beyond Trump. The members of my family who voted for Trump are eager to see their party move back to a more palatable and recognisable form of conservatism. We’ll see.So far, tiptoeing around Jabba the Trump has had limited utility. Despite everything, he still has great sway in the Republican Party. And if the supreme court were to outlaw abortion and approve open carry on guns, that could scramble the equation all over again, sending moderate suburbanites back into the arms of Democrats.Most important, Democrats have to come up with a vocabulary and a vision to elucidate how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and Build Back Better will benefit people. BIF sounds like Willy Loman’s son, and must we ask, to BBB or not to BBB? Yammering about the budget reconciliation process is not going to cut it. Tonally and emotionally, Democratic pols seem at odds with the electorate.At the end of the day, Democrats are going to get some good stuff for Americans, but voters may not realise that because of the big hash the Democrats made with the bills. Asked on Friday if the Democrats could not get out of their own way, Pelosi smiled dryly and replied, “Welcome to my world. This is the Democratic Party.”She sanguinely referred to the damaging internecine warring as “exuberance”. Right now, the bills seem like a Washington abstraction, and it feels as if Biden has been lost in a maze forever, grappling with the minotaurs of Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema and progressives.It’s analogous to Afghanistan. Biden did the right thing pulling us out of the quicksand, but people are mostly going to remember the catastrophic visuals of the botched exit. There is a feeling, many Democrats say, that things are a little out of control – the Afghanistan departure, supply chains, crime, violence, Biden not being able to pass what he wants to pass or even pressing for the votes when he went to the Hill before he left for Europe.The administration lost control of the virus story it didn’t seem to have it together on mask or no mask, school or no school, vaccine mandates or no. Friday’s strong jobs report and a rollout for the children’s vaccine gives Democrats a breather, but many are still wondering if Biden is up to the job. He will need to become a much better salesman than Biff Loman’s dad. – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"policings macho culture must end restore public trust says chief","story":"The macho culture of policing will be brought to an end to restore public trust, the police chief responsible for standards in the profession has said.Writing for The , Chief Constable Andy Marsh, who heads the body overseeing training and codes of behaviour, said policing needed a cultural overhaul to root out misogyny and sexism, end officers covering up for each other  and restore trust in the profession.He said police could no longer blame a few bad apples for the loss of trust and instead said his College of Policing aimed to make it an inhospitable profession for any new recruits or officers who brushed off macho behaviour or toxic comments as banter.He said meeting the Government\u0027s target of 20,000 extra officers would require 50,000 new recruits – equivalent to 40 per cent of workforce – and offered a once in a generation chance to rebuild policing\u0027s reputation with an enhanced input on ethics and integrity at the start of careers.The college, with the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council (NPCC), has already drawn up compulsory ethics courses to warn new recruits against abuse of office in their dealings with the public and make clear that they face disciplinary action and ejection from the force if they do so.The Government\u0027s police recruitment campaign is a once in a generation opportunity to shape the future of the service, wrote Mr Marsh. For example, there is enhanced input on ethics and integrity – and, for the first time, training in vulnerability and crime committed online or digitally – at the start of their careers.These elements are at the heart of many of the recent cases that have undermined public confidence.The moves follow the murder, rape and kidnap of Sarah Everard by Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, which led to a torrent of misconduct claims against police.They include claims that three serving police officers shared misogynistic and racist messages on a WhatsApp group with Couzens, 48, who was known as the rapist in his previous force.Mr Marsh said: I recently heard someone use the phrase \u0027if you can\u0027t trust the police, then who can you trust?\u0027. This might be a summary of the public\u0027s attitude towards the police right now, implying a concerning loss of trust.In recent months, we have seen cases where officers have been convicted of unconscionable acts, while inappropriate behaviour has been overlooked. It simply isn\u0027t enough to say that this is a case of a few \u0027bad apples\u0027.The British public is attuned to what happens in policing and does not accept this as a few isolated incidents, but rather sees a service that needs a cultural overhaul to root out misconduct.Macho behaviour in stations and toxic comments made and brushed off as \u0027banter\u0027 need to end. The public will not tolerate situations where officers protect each other from wrongdoing, and professionals in policing need to feel empowered to challenge behaviour.The College of Policing is responsible for setting standards for the police in England and Wales. Our aim will be to make policing inhospitable for officers and staff who undermine the service\u0027s mission, betray our code of ethics or do not deserve to serve the public.Mr Marsh said it was also vital that British police remained one of the most scrutinised in the world through local politicians, inspectors and Government oversight because openness is an antidote to mistrust.More from NewsMatt Hancock: NHS staff must get their Covid vaccinesClimate change should not be depoliticised – how to fight it is the biggest debate of our ageUK ready to scrap Northern Ireland Protocol’s customs lawsFacebook flooded with child abuse images since switching off scanning software, says NSPCCWinter ski holidays in jeopardy as NHS Covid app ignores booster vaccinationsThe case for compulsory vaccinations for NHS staff is overwhelmingMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"putins chef wanted fbi denies links paramilitary forces online","story":"The Russian businessman dubbed “Putin\u0027s chef who is wanted in the US for alleged electoral fraud has broken cover to insist he is a “pacifist with “no connection whatsoever” to Moscow-backed mercenary groups.In the first ever interview given to the Western press, Yevgeny Prigozhin sought to set the record straight and rebut allegations that he is the financial backer of Russian troll farms and paramilitary forces.Mr Prigozhin, 60, said the West “cannot seem to grasp” what motivates Russia, but that his country and Britain cannot move closer diplomatically as Washington would see it as “driving a wedge” between the allies.Speaking exclusively to The , the notoriously media-averse businessman spoke of the diplomatic relationship between Russia and the West and said it was currently not possible to rebuild trust with Britain.Known as Putin’s chef due to his lucrative catering contracts with the Kremlin, Mr Prigozhin said he had been to events with President Putin on several occasions, but has “no relationship whatsoever” with him and has “no insights” into the Russian leader’s thoughts.He denied in the strongest terms any link between himself and Russian paramilitary forces, specifically the shadowy Wagner Group, thought to be active in Ukraine, Syria and across Africa, as revealed by The  in April.“Relations between the citizens of the United Kingdom and Russia, in my view, are quite friendly and warm,” Mr Prigozhin said.“However, I think relations between countries are always difficult to characterise because they depend heavily on each country\u0027s political position and the political landscape at a particular moment.“As far as I can tell, the UK and Russia do not have an independent state-to-state relationship, except in a purely formal, diplomatic sense. UK policy towards Russia always follows US foreign policy towards Russia. The US has defined its relationship with Russia, and also China, as one of “great power competition”.“So the relationship between the UK and Russia is this: the US and Russia are great powers in competition with each other, and the UK has volunteered to help the US in that competition.”Mr Prigozhin grew up in Vladimir Putin’s home city of Leningrad.In 2001, he personally served Mr Putin and visiting Prime Minister of Japan, Yoshirō Mori, at his restaurant. He subsequently won numerous catering contracts with the Kremlin, including for Mr Putin’s birthday celebrations in 2003.He said he hopes relations between the UK and Russia “do not get any worse” but wondered “how would it be possible for Russia to “rebuild trust” with the UK as long as the US defines Russia as its great-power competitor”?“My personal view is that it makes no sense even to try, as any attempt by Russia to improve relations with the UK will be interpreted by the US as Russia driving a wedge between the US and its ally.“If and when Russia and the United States find an accommodation to coexist and trade peacefully, the UK will inevitably follow suit.”The recent Aukus submarine deal between the US, UK and Australia was an example of Britain’s subservient relationship with Washington, he said.“France withdrew its ambassadors from Washington and Canberra in protest, but did not take any action against London, because there was no point in it. The British joined the deal because the Americans asked them to join,” he said.Mr Prigozhin has been linked to the Leningrad-based Internet Research Agency (IRA), widely seen by Western security officials as a troll farm and source of disinformation.In April this year, the FBI sanctioned Mr Prigozhin, saying the IRA was responsible “for interfering in the 2016 presidential election”.The FBI offered a reward of $250,000 for information leading to the arrest of Mr Prigozhin.The FBI Wanted poster states: “Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin is wanted by the FBI for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the Federal Election Commission, the United States Department of Justice, and the United States Department of State.”US authorities allege Mr Prigozhin has “evolved from simply providing financial support to his global disinformation network to also writing content to denigrate the US electoral process”.Mr Prigozhin strongly denies the allegations and told The : “I have never served in the Russian government and, it bears repeating, I am not closely acquainted with President Putin”.Relations with Russia are at their lowest point since the Cold War, due mainly to the 2014 annexation of Crimea and sponsorship of separatists in eastern Ukraine.The West accuses Russia of interference in domestic political issues, such as the 2016 US Presidential election and the Brexit vote, and of assassinations of political opponents.Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in 2006 in the UK after drinking tea laced with polonium-210, a lethal radioactive substance. A non-judicial public hearing in 2014-15 said it was highly likely Russia was responsible.In March 2018, a former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with the nerve agent novichok, which had been smeared on the front door handle of Mr Skripal\u0027s Salisbury home.Mr Skripal, his daughter and Nick Bailey, a police officer that entered the house, were taken severely ill. All survived, but a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after exposure to the nerve agent.Britain said Russian military intelligence officers Alexander Mishkin and Anatoliy Chepiga, of Unit 29155 of the GRU, were responsible for the attack. London expelled 23 Russian intelligence officers working in the UK under diplomatic cover in response.Mr Prigozhin said the West fundamentally does not understand Russia.“The Russian state exists to protect the interests of the people of the Russian Federation and Russian people.“The Russian Federation is not trying to spread democracy, authoritarianism, Communism, Sharia law, or any other ideology.“This is something that people in the West cannot seem to grasp.“If you want to understand what Russia will do in a particular situation, ask yourself what is in the interests of the Russian people, in a real, material sense: sovereignty, prosperity, independence and security.”Addressing the allegation that he is the financial backer for the Wagner Group, Mr Prigozhin said the last news he heard of the Russian paramilitary outfit was an article in Foreign Policy magazine saying it does not exist.However, he questioned why he had been linked to the Wagner Group.“I “have been linked” by whom?” he asked.“By the US government? By the Russian opposition press which receives US funding? By academics who receive US grants? By a UN “Panel of Experts” in which the Deputy Spokesperson of the US State Department is a member?“I do not know why I have become a minor character in America\u0027s geopolitical fairytales.“Perhaps you will also ask me why the US government thought the kids they droned a few weeks ago in Afghanistan were terrorists. I have no idea. I am actually very surprised that anyone links me with Wagner Group because I am not connected with any groups.”He said “I...can say with confidence that I have no connection whatsoever to Wagner Group or any other mercenary groups”. However, he admitted it “worries me greatly that some people think I have such a connection”.“I am a pacifist,” he said.More from NewsJoe Biden under fire for resisting UK scheme to end polluting car salesMatt Hancock: NHS staff must get their Covid vaccinesClimate change should not be depoliticised – how to fight it is the biggest debate of our ageUK ready to scrap Northern Ireland Protocol’s customs lawsFacebook flooded with child abuse images since switching off scanning software, says NSPCCWinter ski holidays in jeopardy as NHS Covid app ignores booster vaccinationsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish nightclub sidesteps vaccine passport rules placing","story":"Scottish nightclubs are successfully evading the SNP’s vaccine passport rules by putting furniture on their dance floors, leading to claims that the scheme has descended into “a shambolic mess”.Lulu, a major nightclub in Edinburgh, has begun aggressively marketing itself to unvaccinated Scots by advertising the fact that its door staff will not be carrying out checks on whether customers have been jabbed.Nightclubs and other venues, such as stadiums and concert venues hosting major events, have been legally obliged to check customers’ vaccination records in Scotland since last month.However, despite describing itself as “Edinburgh’s best nightclub” and being open until 3am, Lulu said it technically no longer qualified as a nightclub under Scottish Government rules, because it had placed seats on its dance floor.Under the legal definition, only venues with a space “provided for dancing by customers” are classed as a nightclub, meaning those that install seating instead can claim they are outside the scheme\u0027s scope.Hospitality industry representatives said nightclubs across Scotland were exploiting the loophole so that they could ignore vaccine passport rules.“SNP ministers should be embarrassed that they designed such a mess of a scheme,” Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Conservative spokesman for Covid recovery, said.“The vaccine passports guidance is so shambolic that places which are clearly not nightclubs are being billed as nightclubs, and places that are clearly nightclubs are managing to use loopholes to claim they\u0027re not.”Nightclubs have said they have seen revenues plummet since the vaccine passport scheme fully came into force on October 18.More than a fifth of 18 to 29-year-olds in Scotland, around 180,000 people, have so far refused to be vaccinated.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “The scheme allows higher risk settings to continue to operate as an alternative to closure or more restrictive measures and increase vaccine uptake.”More from NewsHeadteachers resist Ofsted plan to reinspect \u0026#39outstanding\u0026#39 schoolsPolicing’s ‘macho’ culture must end to restore public trust, says chief‘Putin’s chef’ wanted by FBI denies links with paramilitary forces and online troll farmsAlmost £10 million spent on home working equipment for civil servantsThe problems in policing are not down to \u0026#39a few bad apples\u0026#39 – it\u0026#39s time for changeHot air and ‘greenwash’: the truth behind Cop26 pledges on coal, cash and treesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"triggering article 16 hardly nuclear option","story":"‘Nuclear option” is the new favourite buzz phrase used by many a commentator on the turgid Northern Ireland Protocol negotiations – particularly those cheering for the EU’s Maros Sefcovic, presently slugging it out with Lord Frost. If the UK government suspends Article 16, as Frost says it might if EU proposals do not “deal effectively with the fundamental difficulties”, there will be “serious consequences”, according to Sefcovic. Hysteria was prevalent in media reports on Friday, followed by professional disappointment when Frost said that Armageddon would be postponed for a week or so.What would these consequences be? For Northern Ireland, according to Sefcovic, it would lead to “instability and unpredictability”, and be “serious also for the EU-UK relations in general, as it would mean a rejection of EU efforts to find a consensual solution” to the protocol’s implementation. Brussels would then be forced to suspend the wider Brexit deal, launching a trade war that would devastate large sections of British business.Apart from the fact that this would entail a month’s notice and allow for another year of negotiations, and that a trade war would crucify the Republic of Ireland, whose present taoiseach, Micheál Martin, is desperate for a sensible compromise, what’s happening in Northern Ireland is very worrying. Sefcovic’s feared “instability and unpredictability” is beginning to manifest itself on some streets in Protestant areas. The appeasement of those who want to destroy Northern Ireland by putting a border in the Irish Sea has taught loyalists, yet again, that violence pays.The EU weaponised fears of sectarian violence, with the help of the complaisant Irish government of Leo Varadkar. He convinced international opinion that a land border would jeopardise the BelfastGood Friday Agreement. This was nonsense, as Lord Trimble, its unionist architect, pointed out vainly. As Lord Frost said in his foreword to a fascinating analysis by Roderick Crawford for Policy Exchange, the North-South dimensions of the Agreement were prioritised at the expense of those of East-West.The British negotiating team, writes Frost, “drifted into accepting the EU’s view that the only way to ensure no ‘hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls’ was for the laws on either side of the border to be identical. This ignored the fact that there already was, and is, an international border, an open one, with different currency systems, laws, taxation, and many trading rules on either side”.The EU pooh-poohed proposals for technological methods of making new border requirements invisible, and the upshot was that in 2019 the only way the new team could make Brexit happen was to agree a sea border. Sinn Féin, beating its United Ireland drum, used this to make many unionists believe their status in the United Kingdom was under threat.Last week saw sectarian rioting in Belfast. Protestant children attacked police, and in the small town of Newtownards, about 10 miles east of Belfast, armed men calling themselves the Protestant Action Force – a cover name for the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force – hijacked and set fire to a bus.A vast new wall sign shows two armed men in balaclavas with the legend: “THE PREVENTION OF THE EROSION OF OUR IDENTITY IS NOW OUR PRIORITY. EAST BELFAST BATTALION.” It’s an improvement on “KILL ALL TAIGS”, but the message is nonetheless alarming.Insecurity has been exacerbated by a National Audit Office report into Brexit that shows exports from the Republic to Northern Ireland jumping by 47 per cent since the Protocol was implemented, while trade the other way rose by 61 per cent. In the view of Jim Allister, leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice, the most hardline of the four unionist parties, “That is a manifestation of the building of the all-Ireland economy... a vehicle to deliver an all-Ireland politically.” The EU, he said, “built itself” – through economic union. “It’s the same strategy to try and deliver a united Ireland – to build an economic union on the island of Ireland and from that it’s a short step to political union.”Sir Jeffrey Donaldson of the DUP said that the EU “ought to recognise that the protocol and its Irish Sea border is causing economic harm and undermining stability in Northern Ireland”. He’s right. Article 16 is a mechanism to be used if the treaty isn’t working, which it clearly isn’t – and nor will it until the EU accepts that instead of defending the status quo they are damaging it by further alienating the Northern Irish people. The real “nuclear option” would be persisting with this present state of affairs.More from NewsMatt Hancock: NHS staff must get their Covid vaccinesClimate change should not be depoliticised – how to fight it is the biggest debate of our ageUK ready to scrap Northern Ireland Protocol’s customs lawsFacebook flooded with child abuse images since switching off scanning software, says NSPCCWinter ski holidays in jeopardy as NHS Covid app ignores booster vaccinationsThe case for compulsory vaccinations for NHS staff is overwhelmingMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccine booster flu jab","story":"Vaccines QA: Who needs a Covid booster - and are there any side effects It’s important to boost your immunity this winter with both the Covid booster and flu vaccineyou’re eligibleAdvertorialByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov  As Covid cases remain high going into winter, the NHS is inviting people aged  or over and those at risk of serious illness to get a booster vaccination.But there could also be a signicant flu surge this winter – so getting your jab for that is vital too. Last winter, social distancing and limited mixing meant that flu cases were much lower than normal, but dangerous viruses spread quickly when people are all crowded together indoors.So this winter it’s important to boost your immunity with both the Covid booster and flu vaccineyou’re eligible. YOUR VACCINE QUESTIONS ANSWERED Who needs a Covid- vaccination booster All those most likely to become seriously ill from Covid- and those who care for them. But first you need to have had your initial two vaccine doses. The booster will be offered to people aged -plus, those with a health condition that puts them at high risk from Covid, people who live and work in care homes, and frontline and social care workers.If I’m eligible, when can I book my Covid booster The NHS will let eligible people know how to get their booster, which they can have from six months after their second dose. People with certain health conditions may be offered it earlier. Thousands of locations across the country offer a Covid- booster, to give people choice and convenient access. If you are eligible, you will be able to book an appointment at a vaccination centre, designated pharmacy or GP-led service using the NHS Covid- national booking service, or you can go to a walk-in service by using the NHS Grab a Jab walk-in site finder. This is alongside many GP-led services and hospitals inviting people to be vaccinated through their services. I’ve tested positive for Covid-, but can I still get a booster Yes, but you should wait  days before bookingyou’ve had a positive Covid test, starting from the date you had the test.Can I get a flu jab at the same time as my Covid booster You’re likely to be offered them at separate appointments, butyou are offered both, it’s safe to have them at the same time.Who is eligible for the free flu vaccine from the NHS  For a full list of those who can get a free flu vaccination see nhs.uk flujab, but they include people aged -plus, those with certain health conditions, pregnant women and frontline health or social care workers. What about kids  Most primary school pupils and those in secondary school years seven to  will be offered the flu vaccination as a nasal spray. Parents or s will need to give consent for this. Children aged between two and threewill be offered a nasal spray by their GP practice. Those aged six months to two years with a long-term health condition that makes them at higher risk from flu will be offered a vaccine injection.Where can I get a flu vaccine Your GP surgery, a pharmacy offering the service, from your midweyou’re pregnant, or at a hospital appointment. School-age children will be offered the vaccine at school. Those that haven’t started school yet or have a long-term health condition can receive the vaccine from their GP.I never get flu – why do I need a vaccine The flu virus kills almost , people and hospitalises tens of thousands more in England in an average year. It’s more important than ever to get your flu jab this year because more people are likely to get it because we didn’t build up natural immunity during the Covid pandemic. If you get flu and Covid at the same time, you’re more likely to be seriously ill. Also, getting vaccinated against flu and Covid- will provide protection for you and those around you for both these serious illnesses.So why didn’t we see much flu in last winter There are several likely factors, including the measures put in place to stop the spread of Covid-. Last winter also saw record levels of flu vaccine uptake.Will we be more vulnerable to flu this year Dferent strains of flu circulate each year. There may be more strains this year as there were so few flu cases last season. Thus there is less immunity against last year’s strains, and they could continue circulating this year along with the new strains.How effective is the flu vaccine It helps protect against the main types of flu virus. While there’s still a chance you might get flu, it’s likely to be milder. The flu vaccine will also stop you from spreading flu to others.I’m pregnant – is it safe to get the Covid and flu jabs Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it’s important to have botheligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancyyou contract Covid- without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby. If you catch flu when pregnant, you’re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birthweight and may even lead to stillbirth. If you’re pregnant you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service. Are there any side effects Serious side effects are very rare.

It probably came to him while watching No Time to Die last month, at the special screening in the fancy new press briefing room we taxpayers coughed up £.m for. Climate change…doomsday clock ticking…the world is hot enough. Bingo! Give ‘em a bit of  - classic Johnstonian populism. So the man with the golden hair reminded fellow world leaders in Glasgow how Bond usually ends up “strapped to a doomsday device desperately trying to work out which coloured wire to pull to turn it off, while a red digital clock ticks down remorselessly to a detonation that will end human le as we know it.”Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section But, he went on, we are in Bond’s predicament today ”except this is not a movie, the doomsday device is real and the clock is ticking.” So it’s time to defuse the bomb. Time to stop “quilting the earth in an invisible and suffocating blanket of CO.” And then Boris looked at his ticking wrist watch and realised it was time to scarper.He’d got dinner with chums in a posh London club, so he leapt on a private jet and flew home, belching out ,kg of CO, when the train would have emitted just kg. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot with a Walther PPK! Boris’s staggering and shameless hypocrisy turned his  moment into a farce…more Johnny English than James Bond. And then his arrogant bid to rip up Commons sleaze rules to help a Tory pal also backfired spectacularly. Boris thinks he’s a maverick with a licence to act in any way he sees fit.  But, as he’s watched Daniel Craig’s final outing already, he knows that even  is replaceable. And with Mr Moneysavvy Sunak waiting in the wings he could find himself scrabbling for the circuit breaker on his own political time bomb.. I wonder what the Queen makes of her Prime Minister’s actions this week  She was so disappointed not to be at Cop, seeing it as a rare opportunity to help save the world for future generations. Her Majesty has met all the great world leaders of the past  years, as she reminded the current lot in her speech. And she told them “what leaders do for their people today is government and politics. But what they do for the people of tomorrow - that is statesmanship.” Boris doesn’t think of today or tomorrow, he only thinks of himself. But now he’s in a right old state - and the clock is surely ticking. I wonderhis speech reminded the Queen of her own meeting with . He shoved her out of a helicopter above the London Olympic stadium in . But now it’s bungling James Blond who’s heading for a fall.

Previously only married couples can claim. Anyone who would have been eligible since a Supreme Court defeat on  August  will be able to apply for backdated payments. Previously there was no timescale for the change, but Budget documents now say: “Payments will go out from the date of the Remedial Order coming into force, which is assumed to be September  for the purposes of this costing. “However, this date may sht depending on Parliamentary timing.”  But the estimated number of partners who will benefit has been drastically revised down. The DWP previously estimated an extra £m in extra benefits would be handed out up to  , but the Budget documents now suggest it will be £m. It was not immediately clear why. The DWP was contacted for comment. People who lose their partner before pension age can claim a Bereavement Support Payment. In February  the High Court struck down the rule in that required grieving partners to have been married. Similar rules in Widowed Parentaposs Allowance, which BSP replaced, had already been defeated in the Supreme Court in .  In future,someone had both a spouse and a cohabiting partner at the time they died, only one of the surviving lovers will be allowed to claim bereavement benefits. In these cases there will be a complex order of priority to decide who gets the benefits, with cohabiting spouses at the top of the list. However, for retrospective claims, there will be transitional payments to cover both lovers. This means payments to a widow or widower will not stop eventhe deceased’s partner at the time puts in a claim too. A DWP official said the revised cost would not mean any change to the generosity of payments. A DWP spokesperson said: “This legislative change is in progress to enable more families to access support during the most dficult of times and will face full parliamentary scrutiny. Once approved by parliament, payments could be backdated to  August .” Comment MORE ON Conservative PartyDepartment for Work and PensionsSupreme CourtBoris JohnsonGrievingPoliticsDating\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Shadow leader of the Commons Thangam Debbonaire said Mr Rees-Moggaposs position has become untenable because he has lost control. Mr Rees-Mogg made an embarrassing u-turn on Thursday, scrapping plans to rip up ethics rules in order to save Owen Paterson from a -day suspension. Boris Johnson had ordered Tory MPs to vote to block the suspension Mr Paterson from the Commons for lobbying on behalf of two firms - and to create a new Tory-led  to review his case. But the plans triggered a furious outcry and were immediately plunged into chaos when Labour, the SNP and Liberal Democrats vowed to boycott the new committee.  Ms Debbonaire slammed the Government, including Mr Rees-Mogg, for “conflating” the Paterson case with attempts to overhaul the standards watchdog. She told Sky Newsapos Trevor Philips on Sunday: “This is Tory sleaze, pure and simple.” And pressed on whether Mr Rees-Mogg should resign, Ms Debbonaire added: “If I was him, I’d be considering my position, that’s what I think he should do today.” She added: “I think his position is untenable. Commons Leader Mr Rees-Mogg told MPs that he would seek cross party changes to the system as the plan did not have support. Environment Secretary George Eustice dismissed the Owen Paterson affair as a “storm in a teacup”. He acknowledged the Government had “made a mistake” in trying to get Mr Paterson’s breach of lobbying rules re-examined by a new Tory-majority committee which would also consider the entire Commons standards regime.  But Labour MP Jess Philips responded to his comments on Twitter slamming Mr Eustice as a liar. She tweeted: George Eustice is just lying. Everything he is saying is just a lie.Owen Paterson did have a chance to defend himself and did so throughout. The motion was about Paterson not just a new process. Lie after lie. The back-tracking came only hours after Cabinet Minister Kwasi Kwarteng was sent out on the airwaves to defend the plan, when he insisted he felt no shame over the controversial overhaul.  Former Tory cabinet minister David Mellor criticised Mr Kwarteng for suggesting the future of Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone was in doubt. Mr Mellor told Sky News: “He was doing it because he thought that would please Boris and a lot of them – it’s like a children’s party – they all want to please daddy, but the reality is a cabinet minister should be above and beyond that.” And he claimed the PMaposs disregard for rules will get him into trouble in the long run. “I think it’s astonishing the Prime Minister has allowed himself to get into this muddle over Owen Paterson, Mr Mellor added. Mr Mellor added to Trevor Phillips on Sunday on Sky News: “The Prime Minister has many great strengths but he doesn’t seem to respect the rules – and he himself gets himself into trouble with these rules, and the fact he doesn’t believe in rules will count against him in the long run.” Comment MORE ON PoliticsConservative Party LondonJacob Rees-MoggLabour Party LondonLiberal DemocratsOwen PatersonBoris Johnson\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dozens of Network Rail update schemes are due to take place as people rush home to their loved ones. The delay information has yet to be added to any timetables used by officials at the rail giant, but experts have warned it could be even more disruptive than pre-pandemic maintenance. Bruce Williamson, a spokesman for transport campaigners Railfuture, said it is crucial that passengers are aware of delays as soon as possible. He told The Sun: “Works need to be communicated clearly with passengers, so they are aware of timetable changes well in advance and have their inconvenience minimised.

Network Rail will announced a coronavirus-delayed back-log of works in the near future, and is urging passengers to “plan ahead,” it was reported. The body also claimed that “ per cent” of their network would be unaffected, but Southern Railway services, which will cease between Victoria and East Croydon for  days from Christmas Day, are expected to wreak havoc.  As will line closures between Glasgow and Motherwell from December , into the New Year. Trains from London to Wales will also be affected due to work at Swindon and Gloucester. Some London Waterloo to Portsmouth services will start from Farnborough. Buses will replace trains around Warwick and Stratford-upon-Avon from December .

The Black Cab drivers have been given MRI scans while remembering the quickest routes through London in a bid to find out how their brains store the information. Previous research has shown that London taxi drivers have a larger hippocampus - the region of the brain which looks after learning and memory - than the general population, and it continues to grow the longer they are on the job. The hippocampus is known to shrink in people who have Alzheimer’s so it is thought the latest work will lead to a breakthrough in detecting dementia earlier so patients can receive treatment sooner.  Scientists hope the latest work will lead to the development of diagnostics for detecting dementia earlier so patients can receive treatment sooner. They will share the results with the charity Alzheimer’s Research UK Since  London cab drivers have been required to complete “the knowledge” which involves memorising , landmarks and , streets and is said to be the most challenging memory test in the world. Professor Hugo Spiers, inset, from University College London, who is carrying out the study, called Taxi Brains alongside PhD students, said: “London cabbies have unique brains. You can’t study these people in New York. There is no other city in the world that has that kind of similarity.” He added: “One of the key things that happens in the early stages [of Alzheimer’s] is that people become disorientated.  “When they step out of the house they don’t know where they really are or which way they need to go. They’re lost.“What we’re hoping to understand better is the potential impact of certain lestyles, in this case navigating every day for most of your adult le using your own memory and not Google, and what is that doing to the brain.” Mike Lewis, , a father of four from Chingford, Essex, who has been a cab driver for  years, volunteered for the project after reading about it on Twitter.Asked about doing the knowledge, he said: “The only way I can describe it is you become obsessed. “You just have to keep doing it until you’re word perfect and everything is just automatic.” Comment MORE ON GoogleUniversity College LondonMike LewisMental healthAlzheimers diseaseDementia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The new climate friendly E fuel could lead to worse problems for drivers because it is less energy dense, meaning motorists will have to use more to cover similar distances. The fuel, that was introduced in September, has won admirers because it contains a higher percentage of renewable fuel - bioethanol. This means it is better for the environment due to the lower levels of carbon emissions. But motoring YouTube channel Number  has warned that E may have far worse problems that could affect all petrol car users. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here The issue, they say, with it being less energy dense means that motorists may have to top up more often, leading to additional costs. In the video, the presenter says: “I need to talk to you about something pretty shocking Iaposve just found out about E fuel. “And it has absolutely nothing to do with the fact it might damage old classics. “No, there is a far worse problem with using E. “It affects every single car on the road which uses petrol whether it is one of the oldest or the very newest car that’s out.” He added: “E causes an increase in fuel consumption for any car thataposs using it. Ethanol is less energy-dense than unleaded fuel.  “So that means that because it has this lower energy density you have to use more and therefore your fuel consumption in your car will go up. “You’re not going to lose any power because your caraposs computer will alter the air-fuel balance to make up for that loss of energy density. “But your fuel consumption will go up. I really couldnapost believe it.” The Department for Transportaposs Introducing E petrol study confirmed drivers would experience lower fuel economy under the new E grade. They confirmed fuel economy may drop by up to two per cent using the new compound. But they said this was ultimately down to the “driving style” of motorists.  The revelation came after concerns were raised by a quarter of private iniduals in relation to fuel economy in the consultation. Drivers questioned about the changes warned this could “mitigate emissions benefits” and could have a “cost impact”. The DfT said: “We have considered the impact on fuel economy and decreasing MPG, which is due to the lower energy density of ethanol compared with fossil petrol when developing our proposals. “Analysis based on average caloric values of the two products suggests fuel economy could reduce by between one and two per cent. “However, the impact will y based on driving style and refinements in fuel blending by suppliers.” According to the RAC, the US Energy Information Administrationclaims the energy content of ethanol is around  per cent lower than unleaded. This means vehicle fuel economy may reduce by around three per cent when using the new fuel. A number of drivers have reported suffering from fuel efficiency problems when using the new fuel. Some Express readers have even complained of receiving up to mpg less since the changes.

Thereaposs often little chance to cook from scratch, especially during the week. Itaposs also a good way of limiting our food waste at a time when weaposre all trying to do our bit for the environment and keep costs down. But itaposs surprising just how much the prices of products can dfer from store to store.To find out how supermarkets compare, the Manchester Evening News visited six stores to buy the same five items.These were Birds Eye potato waffles, Richmond skinless sausages, Birds Eye chicken dippers, Birds Eye omega  fish fingers and Mars ice creams. While some had offers on that would have reduced prices by buying in bulk, we stuck to one of each item for a fairer comparison. We also didnapost take advantage of Tescoaposs Clubcard prices, which would have reduced the bill there.  The pack sizes were mostly exactly the same - with just a larger pack of ice creams in Farmfoods, which weaposve accounted for, and a smaller pack of fish fingers in Iceland, which was balanced out by the larger pack of sausages. We were shocked to discover that overall Tesco came in at the most expensive, at £. for all five items, while Sainsburyaposs - where prices used to be at the higher end - was the cheapest at £.. Thataposs almost a % dference and was helped by the current offer on Mars ice creams, reduced from £ to £. While easier said than doneyour budget is tight or you have little freezer space at home, what our shopping trip did prove was just how much consumers can save by buying in bulk.  At Iceland it was much cheaper to buy two of many of its products - two packs of the skinless sausages for £, saving £. and two packs of Mars ice creams for £, saving £. The same ice cream offer was available at Asda and Morrisons too. And at Iceland a current offer on the -pack of chicken nuggets meant we also got a free pack of  Fab ice lollies worth £. Farmfoods had similar bulk offers, with two boxes of the waffles for £ and the larger box of ice creams bringing the price down too.

Christian Brueckner fell silent when friends spoke about the vanished toddler, Nakscije Mtari claims - but later admitted being nearby at the time. Ms Mtari also said that the convicted paedophile, now , hit her when she discovered child pornography showing young blonde girls being abused on his phone.In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, she said that Madeleineaposs disappearance had been raised by pals in  at a party in their home in Braunschweig, Germany.But Brueckner made no answer when it was discussed, Ms Mtari said.  When she asked him about it later, she said he told her: “I know about Maddie, I was near the hotel at the time. I was living in the area at the time. I am not going to say anything more. The three-year-old vanished from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May . Ms Mtari - who has told German police about the conversation - said she was terried of her former partner, who she described as controlling. The relationship, which began when she was , came to an end when he launched a brutal attack on her when she discovered child pornography on his phone and laptop. She said: I asked him about the videos and pictures and that’s when he punched me. Ms Mtari, now , said she fell down the stairs and was unconscious for around  minutes after the attack, which she and her mother reported to the police. Police discovered nearly  photos of children being abused and  videos, including images showing Brueckner abusing the daughter of a previous girlfriend. In  he was jailed for  months for the assault. German authorities identied Christian Brueckner as a prime suspect in Maddieaposs case last year and said they had concrete evidence the missing girl was dead. Investigators are now said to be  per cent convinced the convicted sex offender is the man responsible. But the -year-old has taunted German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who claims to have enough evidence to charge the rapist, saying he is bluffing. Sources close to Brueckner told The Sun Online : B and his legal team remain sure Wolters and his investigators don’t have a shred of evidence to convict him on or charge him over.Their position has always been clear:there is evidence, show it. But the police never have. That’s why they are convinced these comments are a bluff designed to get B to crack behind bars and confess to someone. That will never happen. B believes Wolters is simply a celebrity cop looking to make headlines.” Brueckner is currently serving a seven-year sentence for raping an American tourist in Portugal in  and the prosecution team are taking time to gather as much evidence as possible before bringing allegations to court.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Madeleine MccannCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She was finally back at her weekly choir meeting, after months of online sessions only during lockdown. But this isn’t any choir – it’s a special singing group, Shared Harmonies, for people with respiratory problems. For Christine, who has pulmonary fibrosis, it’s a leline. “It’s brilliant,” says Christine, , a retired secretary who lives in Drighlington, West Yorks, with her husband David, . “You meet new people. You make friends and are able to talk to people who really understand your problems.” Until now, most people with conditions like pulmonary fibrosis had to find such support groups themselves by searching online or contacting charities. But in , the NHS committed to hiring , special coordinators by March  – helping doctors prescribe activities like gardening groups, community choirs and fitness classes.Now, the Government hopes community groups can help tackle the country’s health and wellbeing crisis in the wake of the pandemic. Emma Baylin, a former NHS volunteer coordinator, welcomes the changes. “It’s positive the NHS sees the value in social prescribing. It can help with early intervention and prevention for a host of wellbeing and health issues,” she says. “I’ve seen first-hand people who have reduced their dependence on NHS services through accessing community groups.”  Nicola Harker, a le coach and former NHS GP , agrees. While working as a GP, she once took the unusual decision to prescribe poetry writing to a patient who had suffered a stroke and was struggling to express himself verbally. “It’s hugely valuable. This particular patient was very frustrated but traditional medication wouldn’t have been able to help. It almost brought me to tears to see how his le changed because he had a new vocation and he solved his communication dficulties,” she says. “While we have to be realistic that social prescribing can’t patch over the funding gaps in the NHS, it can certainly help. “I’d like to see people on the waiting list for mental health services being connected with community projects in the meantime, or people going through cancer treatment finding groups which allow them to express their experiences.” Christine was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in  after a persistent cough and breathlessness. At the time, she was given from three to five years to live. “It was devastating, but doctors have since found a cause for my condition and I’m still here  years later,” she says. She found out about Shared Harmonies online, and discovered a class a few miles away in Leeds. “We start by doing relaxation exercises, before deep breathing and stretching. Then we sing two or three simple, short songs with harmonies. “Sometimes we get things wrong and have a few laughs. I’ve made great friends over the years and couldn’t wait to get back to meeting in person after lockdown.” While Christine and her husband were lucky enough to find lots of local support groups online, she agrees more people would find groupsdoctors signposted patients to them. “I don’t know what I’d do without them,” she says. “I have friends locally who I can talk to but it’s not the same as speaking to someone who really understands what you’re going through.”  Christine goes for regular breathing tests and says singing every week has improved her lungby seven per cent. But it’s the emotional support she values most. “It’s so comforting knowing there are groups like this out there, and I think it’s great the NHS is going to start prescribing community classes more.” Avril Clerkson, who teaches fitness classes for people with limited mobility, is also thrilled about the NHS proposals. “People often think they won’t be able to exercise after surgery or being diagnosed with an illness, but we offer a class anybody can do regardless of mobility,” says Avril, , who lives in Addiewell, West Lothian, with husband Steven, . She found out about Paracise exercise classes after being diagnosed with breast cancer during a routine mammogram. She had a lumpectomy and some of her lymph nodes were removed, meaning she had limited movement in her left side and suffered from lymphedema, a fluid build-up in the body. “The diagnosis was a horrible shock and I’d always been very active so it was great to find a class I could still do after my surgery.”  Since starting the classes, she has regained full movement in her left side and the swelling in her left arm is greatly reduced. Now she teaches Paracise classes and has seen the benefits for others too.In lockdown, she could be found bouncing around in her kitchen teaching classes on Facebook.“A lot of people were saying they lived alone and were missing the company Paracise brings,” she says. “So I kept the groups going online and it was a godsend for a lot of people.”The Scottish health service already refers people to her classes for a range of health conditions, including arthritis, fibromyalgia and stroke. And she is glad social prescribing is becoming more widespread.“Classes like this can help prevent people having falls at home, help faster recovery from surgery, and can prevent some people needing mental health services, which eases the NHS burden.” For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Aishah Iqbal has psoriasis and says community groups helped her cope with the condition in lockdown. “I’ve had it for  years. It started during my GCSEs from stress and has impacted me at dferent points in my le,” says Aishah, , a paediatric doctor from Leicester. “It gets really itchy and has an impact on my ability to concentrate in the day and I don’t get much sleep at night so it’s a horrible cycle and hits my confidence.” During lockdown she suffered a particularly bad flare-up and turned to a community support group she found through Facebook. “When I wasn’t really getting much social interaction, I found it harder to fight the sad feelings brought on by my condition. “But having people around me who were going through something similar made me realise I wasn’t alone.” Aishah believes social prescribing can be a leline. “Stress and anxiety can make long-term health conditions much worse, so while medication can help, emotional support is important too. While the NHS is great, there are limits to what it can provide, so putting people in touch with community groups is a great idea.” ■For more information go to sharedharmonies or paracise Comment MORE ON NHSHospitalsMental healthPrescriptionsFitnessSunday MirrorCoronavirusFitness And Health\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Saiqa Parveen, , who refused the jab while pregnant, died after Dua was saved by a ­caesarean. Today Saiqa’s brother begs mums-to-be: “For God’s sake, get the vaccine.The heartbroken family of the unvaccinated mum who died from Covid without getting to meet her newborn daughter have begged all pregnant women to get jabbed, Birmingham Live reports.Saiqa died in intensive care after catching the virus while carrying her fth child and before she went into hospital. Last night her distraught family told the Birmingham Live of their pain as they implored other expectant mums to get vaccinated. Releasing a picture of Saiqa fighting for le in hospital – and the beautul baby she never got to hold – brother Qayoum Mughal, , urged: “For God’s sake, get the vaccine.”Saiqa, from Birmingham, was eight months into her pregnancy when she fell ill in mid-September. She was offered a Covid shot in summer but insisted she wanted to wait until her baby was born. As her condition worsened, Saiqa was placed in intensive care and underwent an emergency caesarean section at full term on September . She died this week – leaving behind her husband Majid Ghafur, , and daughters Noor, , Imaan, , Hibbah, eight, and Ayesha, six – and without ever meeting newborn Dua Maryam. Qayoum revealed how Saiqa’s daughters made a heartbreaking final online FaceTime call just an hour before their mum died on November . He told the Sunday Mercury: “They said, ‘Get up mummy, we are waiting, we are missing you, we love you, why are you leaving us behind  Just get up’. They were praying and in tears.” One in five of the most critically ill Covid patients are unvaccinated pregnant women, NHS figures show.Since July, % of patients on special lung-bypass machines were expectant mums who had not had their first jab. Qayoum, a dad of four, said: “I strongly ask all people please get their vaccination, otherwise you will have a bad situation like we are facing. “Get the vaccine and avoid this sort of tragedy. The family is completely broken. There is such a big sadness.” Saiqa had no underlying health conditions and her pregnancy had been routine until she tested positive for Covid on September . Two days later she developed breathing problems and was taken by ambulance to Birmingham’s Heartlands Hospital. She was discharged six days later only to be admitted to Good Hope Hospital on September  with breathing dficulties. Qayoum said: “She was on oxygen and on September  she called my we at pm and said she had signed documents saying thather condition worsened, the doctors could operate to take the baby out. “My we said she sounded very tired and only spoke for a few minutes. That was the last conversation with any of us. “The next morning her husband phoned us and told us that she was on a ventilator and they were preparing to operate. At pm, the doctor called her husband and told him they had delivered a baby girl. “We did not see her because she was on a ventilator in intensive care. She never saw her daughter.”By now Saiqa was also battling le threatening sepsis, a hole in both her lungs, as well as pneumonia and other infections.Qayoum said: “They allowed her husband to see her on October  and the doctor said she was very ill. “The doctor was telling him to talk to her. She was sedated but could hear. “He was talking to her, telling her that her eldest daughter is asking you to get up and ‘where is her birthday gt’ and she is missing mum. As soon as he said this, there was one long tear coming from her eye. That was the first and last reaction we had from her on the ventilator.”  Saiqa died just before pm on Monday. Her death certicate records respiratory failure and Covid- pneumonitis as the cause. Qayoum, who has had Covid himself, said: “Her daughters ask, ‘When’s mummy coming back ’ Saiqa was the most caring person, she couldn’t live without her family. She was a lady of principle. “She cared for everybody and her mother is still alive. She was very hard working and a helpful lady.” He added: “Her husband is crying but he’s got to be strong for his daughters.” The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation says all pregnant women should be offered a Covid jab after studies proved it is safe. Previously it was offered only to pregnant women in frontline health and care or to the extremely clinically vulnerable. More than , mums-to-be have had a first dose and around , a second. Data from over , Covid vaccinations in pregnancy in England and Scotland, and a further , in the US, show there has been no subsequent harm to the foetus or baby. England’s chief midwery officer Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent said: “The Covid- jab can keep you, your baby and your loved ones out of hospital.”For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON NHSHospitalsPregnancyGiving birthNewborn babyCoronavirusSunday PeopleCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Then he dumped her for another nurse – all behind the back of his trusting we. Fuller, , would go on to abuse scores of bodies in two hospital mortuaries. But his mistress only learned of his grotesque offences when he faced court last week. She told the Sunday Mirror today: “To think I’m associated with someone who did something so terrible is awful. I’m very lucky he didn’t kill me.”  As MPs called for an inquiry into Fuller’s hospital access, the woman, whose identity we are protecting, also revealed:She lived in a studio flat just around the corner from his two victims in the Bedsit Murders. Fuller charmed her and seemed the “perfect gentleman”. They met at a hospital social club, he drank Archers and lemonade and once took her to a Beverley Craven pop concert. Fuller always appeared to be ice cool and “would never get angry”.The woman believed Fuller to be an “ordinary, quiet man” – yet he was an arrogant lothario who had affairs with at least two female colleagues during three marriages. She started dating Fuller in  when he was with second we. Three years earlier he had sexually assaulted and killed Wendy Knell, , and Caroline Pierce, , in Tunbridge Wells, Kent.  The woman, now happily married, said: “I was quite aware of the Bedsit Murders and I was very nervous about them. The murders were in my mind and a lot of young women’s minds. “Little did I know I was actually dating the person responsible. In the back of my mind I do still think, ‘Why was I spared ’ “I was in the right criteria in that I lived in the roads near where the girls worked, I had a bedsit and I was in my s.”  Fuller admitted his guilt last week, four days into a murder trial. It was then revealed in court that he had defiled up to  bodies in hospital morgues. His female victims ranged in age from nine to . The revelations have shaken Fuller’s ex to the core. She told the Sunday Mirror: “He was a perfect gentleman with me. I didn’t see a bad side to him at all.  “There was nothing to lead me to believe he’s the person we’ve now found him out to be now. “He never showed any perversion in bed. He was totally ordinary and normal. There was nothing at all. I still can’t believe that he could be capable and part of me still doesn’t want to believe it, but equally I want him to pay for what he’s done. “I didn’t know anything about the mortuary offences until it came out in court. I was really shocked. The police said to me, ‘Be prepared for a nasty shock’, but I wasn’t expecting anything as horric as this. I just thought it was going to be that there were other women like me, or multiple women that he was dating all at the same time. It’s been a traumatic time.”  She went on: “I was  when I began seeing him and I was with him for just over two years. “I was a district nurse and some of us used to go up to the canteen in Kent and Sussex Hospital . I was at a loose end and trying to make new friends, so I started going to the social club. I remember thinking he was quite odd for a man because he drank Archers and lemonade. “He wasn’t a beer man. He was quite a quiet man, but he was quite friendly. He just seemed like a perfectly ordinary person.”  She remembers Fuller being in a cycling club and doing the -mile London to Brighton ride. One of the club routes went directly past the dyke where he dumped murdered Caroline. Of their dates, she said: “The first outing was to the Folkestone Air Show. We once went to a Beverley Craven concert in London and he would visit me at my flat, but most of it was at the social club at the hospital. “He wasn’t the type of bloke to take me out for dinner or offer to take me anywhere particularly, but he was always pleasant and friendly. He would never get angry. It was hard to know what was going on in his head.  “He was an electrician at Kent  Sussex Hospital at the time. Sometimes when he was on call, rather than stay in his house at Broomhill Bank School, he’d stay in the nurses’ home. “I knew he was unhappy with his we. But our relationship ended because he didn’t want what I wanted and he didn’t want to be with me any more. I had to accept that he didn’t want me and he wanted someone . “I remember him saying to me that he had met another staff nurse and he was going to start seeing her.”  The woman called police last December after news of Fuller’s arrest. She explained: “When I saw his name I thought, ‘Well, Fuller is a common surname’. I looked at my phone hours later and there was a photo of him. I recognised him from the fact his eye was turning in. I was really shocked.” Fuller’s arrest came after a DNA breakthrough. A search of his home uncovered hard drives revealing prolic sexual offending of a kind no British court has seen before. Between  and , he had filmed and photographed himself sexually abusing the bodies of dozens of women and girls at the Kent and Sussex Hospital and nearby Tunbridge Wells Hospital. Fuller admitted two counts of murder at Maidstone Crown Court. He previously admitted  sexual offences, including  counts relating to  identiable mortuary victims. MPs have called for a public inquiry. And the daughter of one victim said: “It kills me to think of David Fuller’s hands on Mum in the mortuary.” Meanwhile, his shaken ex is having counselling. She added: “What he did is up there with the Moors Murderers, the Wests and Shipman. If I could eradicate it all, I would. I keep thinking, ‘Why was I so naive and stupid to get involved with someone like him ’” aposFailure to learn lessons of Savileapos - Comment, by Mark Williams-Thomas, the ex-cop who exposed Jimmy Savile The dead deserve as much dignity as the living, but David Fuller denied victims any respect whatsoever. He got away with murder for  years. Evading capture, he convinced himself he was untouchable. And, like all sex offenders, he then sought out vulnerable victims – dead women and children – to fulfil his warped sexual desires. But it is only by luck and the arrogance of Fuller that the police uncovered sexual offending as far back as  at two Kent hospitals because he kept “trophies” of his attacks and records of his abuse. In , I exposed Jimmy Savile – the DJ and TV star who sexually assaulted patients for decades across the NHS. It led to  hospitals undertaking urgent reviews.But it is clear now that lessons were not learned and, yet again, the most vulnerable in our society have been failed. In  Fuller had a criminal records check which revealed he had hidden a string of burglary convictions. Yet he stayed in post. Fuller should have been sacked immediately. So why wasn’t he  Crimes of necrophilia are extremely rare and carry a maximum jail term of just two years. Post-Savile, a review highlighted the need to reduce access to mortuaries, yet this was clearly not the case at two Kent hospitals.  When Fuller murdered Wendy and Caroline he took trophies – something he repeated will all his future victims. That brings with it considerable risk because it’s a forensic link to the victim and compelling evidence. So why take such a risk  I have no doubt Fuller kept trophies so he could relive his attacks and watch footage again, enabling him to get perverse sexual gratication. I’ve no doubt Fuller has abused many more women and young people. His offending will be far wider than hospital mortuaries. I would go much further, given that we have over , unsolved murders in the UK and everything that I know about Fuller and how offenders operate. I say with some confidence that he killed again after .

Thataposs because according to a former royal chef she has an unusual technique for eating the fruit so she doesnapost look like a gobbling monkey. Unlike the rest of us, Her Majesty refuses to peel and then eat it, instead, she peels it with a kne and fork. According to Darren McGrady, who once worked in the royal kitchens, the Queen would cut the top and bottom off, then slice the skin away -ways. She then chopped it up into small pieces before eating them with a fork.  Being strict about the way she eats bananas isnapost the Queenaposs only food quirk. She will never eat or serve, garlic - even on formal occasions. Although she has good reasons behind this - itaposs because the royal family have to meet and greet so many people so never wants the smell of garlic on her breath. Shellfish is also a no go area as itaposs one of the foods most likely to cause food poisoning. However, it was recently reported the Queen has given up one of her nightly habits when it comes to food and drink.

Her decision to give up booze is not linked to any health issues and a palace source said: It is a recent and personal decision by the Queen. Meanwhile, a family friend told Vanity Fairaposs royal correspondent Katie Nicholl: The Queen has been told to give up her evening drink which is usually a martini.

Laura Evans, and Ed Knight, both , set themselves a challenge of making a Caddy Maxi van into a liveable space. The couple from Kingston-upon-Thames, London, deliberately purchased a small van to show others that home on wheels doesn’t always have to be big. The ‘adventure van’ was once used for workers of an energy and home services provider but now it is kitted out with a kitchen and bed. The couple used repurposed materials such as wood and even made a skyline roof by inserting a square window. Laura, who is a shop assistant, said: “It took four months for us to rip everything out, insulate and convert it into a mini camper. “We wanted to challenge ourselves and be creative as the pandemic put a halt on our international travel plans. “The van was in excess of £,. “And it cost £, on the mechanical work and materials such as reclaimed wood for the , the bed frame and small cupboards.“We tried to cut costs as much as we can by purchasing stuff from Facebook marketplace such as Moroccan tiles for the kitchen.“But we bought the oven brand new to ensure it worked.” All appliances such as the oven with a hob, fridge with freezer, tap with an electric pump, LED lighting, l fresh water and full solar system including a leisure battery were brand new.  But the stone sink was purchased from Facebook marketplace but was too big. Laura adds: The solution was to apossinkapos our basin into the unit and let the countertop form around. We love this finish and we believe it looks better thanwe had just simply placed it on top. Just like the kitchen doors, we used Scottish Elm for our countertops but kept the live edges and Eddy cleverly used a jigsaw to cut a waney edge to follow the curvy doors at the end of each unit.  Eddy made solid Elm shaker doors in the kitchen with close weave Rattan  which is a natural cane woven material. It is a biodegradable material which looks amazing. From the outside, the blue vehicle looks like any other Volkswagen van but inside it is a shabby chic space. With a wooden ceiling and laminate flooring, the van boasts enough room for two people but one cannot stand due to the low ceiling.  Ed said: “This is an adventure van - used for sleeping and eating. Itaposs perfect for curling up in bed and watching a movie but it is built as an adventure van so not one for spending days inside. “We loved seeing people’s reaction when we have opened the door in a public place. “They always had to double-take - especiallythey see us with a meal as you would never think there is a working kitchen in it.  “We wanted to show others that you don’t need a massive van to make a home. “We still have our home comforts such as fluffy pillows and a comfy mattress but you can’t stand up.” Ed, who is a joiner, insulated the van and did most of the handy work whilst Laura focused on bargain hunting and interior. The couple spent eight hours per day over eight weeks transforming the van into a living space.  They went on to travel around Cornwall and Isle of Skye, Scotland, before selling it. Ed said: “Laura did the finishing touches too such as most of the painting, oiling and sanding. It is much better to buy an ex-service van because it has been looking after and the mileage is good. “With clever designs, you can do it cheaper - making it better in the long run. “Laura lost her job in events as a result of the pandemic in December . “She began working part-time so this gave her something more to focus on. “We spent a total of £, and made some profit when selling it on.

It is forecast to bring sustained winds to the UK by Tuesday and a US National Hurricane Centre map shows it headed right for the country. This comes as there is currently a yellow warning for wind in place for northern Scotland until pm on Sunday. The warning states: Strengthening west to north westerly winds will bring gusts of -mph perhaps locally mph, to exposed locations of northern Scotland. “These winds initially across the Western Isles and north west mainland Scotland on Saturday evening, spreading to the north east mainland and Orkney overnight and Sunday morning. “In combination with high spring tides this is expected to lead to large waves around the coasts. Winds gradually easing through Sunday afternoon.” Britain is set for more unsettled next week as remnants of Tropical Storm Wanda arrive from Tuesday. Met Office forecaster Dan Harris said: “Tropical Storm Wanda is not too far from the UK - and may indirectly influence the forecast early next week.”Netweather and STV forecaster Jo Farrow added: “If Wanda gets caught up with another Atlantic low pressure, its tropical energy could help bring wet and windy weather to the UK.”It is currently over the Atlantic Ocean and will move north eastwards during the course of the weekend. On Sunday night Wanda is expected to weaken and be downgraded to a non-tropical feature, and what is left of the storm will become embedded within a larger Atlantic frontal zone, the Met Office said.  This will then move across the UK on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Met Office said it could lead to rainfall and potentially weather warnings - although the timing and track of the system is still uncertain. UK forecast for next five days Today: Windy, especially across northern and eastern Scotland where gales or severe gales and high gusts expected. Many areas will be dry with sunny spells, but some showers are likely in the north and west and the Midlands. Colder than yesterday. Tonight: Daytime showers fading this evening leaving many areas dry and chilly with clear spells overnight. Turning cloudier with rain at times in the west later. Becoming less windy. Monday: Bright at first in the south and east, then turning cloudier later but remaining mainly dry. Cloudier and windier in the north and west with rain at times, especially later. Outlook for Tuesday to Thursday: Cloud and rain moving southeast through Tuesday with blustery showers following in the north. Cloud and outbreaks of rain in the south likely ing north midweek. Mild in the south.

Lorraine Scott was out with her dog in Wirral early this morning when she got spooked by a strange man approaching her car. Lorraine, who is from Birkenhead, was taking her German shepherd dog Toby for a run on Leasowe beach at around .am this morning when she got freaked out by a stranger following her.The -year-old told the Liverpool Echo : “I turned into the car park for the beach and I spotted this maroon car on my right hand side.“I carried on driving down towards the steps to the beach because it’s easier for the dog and parked by a vacant car.  “I then started to sort everything out, like get my wellies on and get Toby sorted and noticed that the maroon car must have turned around from the way he was facing when I drove in as it was pulling up beside the vacant car by me. “I knew whoever it was had seen that I was on my own when I drove past, but I didn’t think anything of it at this point.” Lorraine said she continued to prepare for her run when she noticed a man get out from the car and begin slowly making his way towards her. She said he was scanning the area intensely while walking towards Lorraine’s passenger seat. Lorraine said: “At this point I started to get really panicky and I just froze. “I couldn’t really do anything, I just froze.” The man continued to slowly approach Lorraine but it was at this point that three-year-old Toby saw him getting ‘too close’ and began to react to his ‘strange’ presence. Lorraine said: “Toby started barking and going mad at him and then straight away the man jumped and ran straight back into his car and drove away very quickly. “I’m just really happy I had my protector with me. He’s naturally a protective breed and because of our bond he will always protect me.”  Lorraine said the incident freaked her out as she has never been in a situation like that before and despite being trained in kickboxing she didnapost know how to react.Writing about the incident on a community Facebook page, Lorraine said: “If I had been on my own, this might have been a dferent story - luckily my German shepherd is protective of me.“Iaposve been at this beach before and never had anything like this happen and there is always people camping the night there so never usually though anything strange about people being parked up there. “Hopefully this post will make people aware there are some weirdos about and to be extra careful, so glad I have a German shepherd to protect me.” The man was said to be wearing a black tracksuit and and black crew neck t-shirt. He had a shaved head with blonde hair, was of a slim build and approximately ft  in height from what Lorraine could make out. Lorraine says she is still shaken up after the incident and in future she will continue to walk Toby with her husband like she would usually do.

He added that younger relatives should urge eligible parents and grandparents to take up both the offer of a booster and a flu vaccine. Javid said: Almost  million people in the UK have received their Covid- booster and third jabs, a phenomenal achievement in under two months. “As we approach this milestone, I want to thank those who have come forward and urge everybody across the nation to get vaccinated, get protected and get boosted.

If we all come together and play our part, we can get through this challenging winter, avoid ato restrictions and enjoy Christmas.” It is possible that in the future, a third jab could become a requirement to avoid travel restrictions - a move which is expected to further drive the uptake of boosters.Government guidelines state that people who are  and over, or aged  and over with a health condition that puts them at high risk of contracting Covid-, and had their second dose six months ago are eligible to get their booster.

Of course, administering eyelash extensions is a very particular skill, and being so close to the eye, thereaposs a lot that can go wrong in the wrong hands. So, you can understand just how horried one lash technician was, when she had a client come in to have a set of botched lashes removed, after an unqualied beautician stuck them on using hair bonding glue. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.TikTok user IPS Beauty @ipsbeautytook to the app to share a clip of the botched lashes, insisting it should be illegal for any client to be left with their lashes in such a poor state.A client came in for a removal today, I was horried, the technician wrote on the clip. Extensions applied with hair bonding glue and zero isolation. This should be ILLEGAL! The beautician went on to explain how her client had been left with very few of her own lashes after trying to remove the extensions at home resulted in her pulling most of her lashes out. Ouch. Look at how sparse her natural lashes are. She came to me like this so the other lashes were probably ripped out, she wrote. Understandably, the beauticianaposs followers were also left horried over the lashes, with many accusing the person who did the botched job as a aposfakeapos. What is wrong with all these FAKE lash techs! If you can’t do it properly don’t do it, one follower commented, while another added: Iaposm still f**king learning and I can do better.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Brandon Anderson, who helps professional cleaners find clients, recently showed off a video of someone doing just this to a filthy carpet. However, viewers who saw the clip on TikTok were horried by the sheer amount of dirt involved - as they initially just assumed that the carpet was a chic dark grey colour. But as the expert went at the fabric with a steam cleaner, the carpet can be seen to completely transform back to its original shade. And it wasnapost meant to be grey at all - it was in fact beige. The carpet had so much dirt and grime in it that it had darkened over time due to lack of care. Thousands of people have watched the clip, mesmerised by the cleaning process.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. One person replied: But HOW ! Another said: This is why I HATE carpet. I donapost believe it, proclaimed a third. Someone  wrote: GROSS.  My eyes went from wide to wider, admitted a dferent user. A sixth person added: Throw away the whole house. Others thought that it was nasty and shared comments with the vomiting emoji. This comes after a dferent TikTok user had a similar experience with the laminate flooring in their new home. Posting under the name @dandycleans she uploaded a clip on to the social media  showing her scrubbing a section of her floor and as she wipes, it becomes lighter and lighter. The video was captioned: When I moved in I just thought the floor was dark. The floor initially did appear to be dark, but her hard work soon reveals the regular laminate flooring underneath. More than , people watched her clean, with over , liking it. However, some people werenapost quite so impressed, with a few wonderingsheaposd actually cleaned the floor or just removed the stain. But @dandycleans was quick to insist that it was laminate flooring and it really was just THAT dirty. Have you ever made a gross discovery like this  Let us know in the comments below.

Sometimes it can go great, but sadly, thataposs not always the case, and many daters have experienced being catfished, or arguably worse their date not showing up at all. One woman has revealed how she thought her date had done a runner halfway through their date, after he disappeared for  whole minutes after conveniently aposforgetting his wallet.aposTikTok user Ashleigh @hai_im_ashleigh_had been speaking to her date aposPaulapos for several months before they were able to finally meet up, due to conflicting schedules, but when he heard she was hanging out at a shopping centre near where he lived, he offered to come over and meet her.  Since Ashleigh was with a friend, Paul offered to treat them both to dinner and she admits he seemed to be a very nice guy. We met him at a LongHorn steakhouse - he shakes her hand and hugs me, she explained in a TikTok clip. Once we get to the door [of the restaurant], he starts patting his pants and goes aposoh my god, I left my wallet [in the car]. Go ahead and put our name on the waitlist.

More than  minutes later, Paul hadnapost come back, prompting Ashleigh and her friend to believe theyaposd been stood up, so they left and decided to get a McDonaldaposs instead. So I was sitting there, almost in tears, because I really liked this guy, she continued. And me and my friend just decide to leave and go grab some McDonaldaposs because I wasnapost really in the mood to get a steak dinner at that point. But, as they were leaving the restaurant, the pair noticed Paulaposs car parked up nearby, so Ashleighaposs friend decided to march up to the vehicle and confront him. My friend went up to the car and let out a scream, Ashleigh recalled, adding that she quickly ran over to see what all the fuss was about. Me being the nosy a** I am, went up to the car, looked in and saw this man butt a** naked. He just rolls down the window and says, aposdo you want to have a threesome apos Itaposs fair to say weaposd rather have been stood up.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Derrie Mathews had no one to blame but herself, after asking the beauticianshe could be sprayed twice, in a bid to compensate for her apossuper paleapos natural red head complexion. The -year-old went to get the £ treatment two days before a wedding in order to give her winter skin a warm, summer glow - but she couldnapost quite believe her eyes when she woke up the next morning. I was going to a wedding, and Iaposm super, super pale - I am really freckly and white. So, I just asked the girlshe would do it twice, so much darker, Derrie explained. At first, the mum didnapost notice much of a dference to her complexion and it wasnapost until she woke up the following day that she realised sheaposd made a huge mistake. Derrie said: You have to leave it on for eight hours and then wash it off after, and it was just getting darker and darker and darker. But I didnapost wash it off after eight hours because it stops developing then. On Friday morning, when she awoke and looked in the mirror, she couldnapost believe the shade that sheaposd turned, much to the amusement of her husband.

My husband couldnapost stop laughing, and my daughter was petried that anyone would see me. I knew I looked so ridiculous, so I didnapost tell him not to do it. I fully deserved everything! Derrieaposs double spray tan blunder is reminiscent of the famous Friends episode, in which Ross misunderstands the tanning booth, and ends up getting sprayed with two twos - twice! She said: When the girl did it, my friend was with me, and I was saying, aposIaposm an eight, Iaposm an eightapos because thataposs what Ross says! But despite her tanning experience not quite going to plan, Derrie hasnapost been put off spray tans and says sheaposll definitely be ing in the future.

Then there are the more common names, that most people have absolutely no problem whatsoever saying out loud.However, every now and then it seems thereaposs a crossover between the two and this is where it gets tricky, as a parent takes a popular name and decides to alter the pronunciation - but keep the spelling the same.One woman has recounted an awkward situation she found herself in after getting a childaposs name wrong.Taking to TikTok, the nurse, known only as Lindsey, admitted that sheaposs bad with names but didnapost think she could butcher the name Liam after she saw it on a patientaposs file. She said: Iaposm a paediatric nurse and Iaposm from the deep, deep south, so I butcher everybodyaposs name. If itaposs not something super simple like Ben or Sally, Iaposm gonna butcher it. So, I see a kidaposs name on our computer and I say aposOh, Liam, I got this. L-I-A-M. Liam. Easyapos. I go out, call the kidaposs name, nobody moves. Call him again. Nobody moves. Call him again nobody moves. Finally this mum stands up and says aposDo you mean aposYum apos And I say aposNo, Liam apos and she said aposYeah, itaposs short for Williamapos. Lindsey finishes the video by doing a mind blown gesture, adding boom.Her clip went viral, being watched more than three million times and garnering over , likes.Thousands of people also commented, with one saying: My sonaposs name was Liam. His new name is Yum.Another replied: As a mum of a Liam, I am perturbed. Others began sharing unfortunate and amusing names theyaposd come across.

I met Ben when I was , having just left my husband of  years. We were teaching in the same school and bonded immediately – after I had given him a telling off for not doing his job properly! We moved in together three months later, in the summer of .Our little house was perfect, but odd noises kept us up at night. We’d hear footsteps on the stairs and despite it being a new build, we put it down to creaky floorboards and cooling pipes.Then subtle sounds became a whole lot scarier. One afternoon, Ben was out and I was happily relaxing in the bath when I heard a male voice call my name. I froze – maybe it was the old tenants  Nervously, I called out, “Who’s there ” but the house was silent. I was shaken to the core, but I didn’t tell Ben. We were still in the early days of our relationship and I didn’t want to seem like a madwoman! But that all changed a few weeks later. We’d just finished dinner and popped the telly on, ready for a chill evening on the sofa. Out of nowhere, our pot plant shted across the shelf in front of us and dropped to the floor. We both stared in disbelief – the hairs stood up on the back of my neck. We couldn’t deny it now, our house had a poltergeist. It shattered everything I felt I knew about le. Brought up in a strict Catholic family, I was taught that there’s no such thing as ghosts. But now I know they’re very real.Moving house costs a fortune, we couldn’t afford to just jump up and leave. I felt like I couldn’t talk about what I was experiencing, scared of losing respect at work. We had to come to terms with it and initially had no intention of sharing our story. Then, two years later, we decided to find others who were experiencing hauntings, to help us feel less alone. We thought we’d be laughed at, but it turns out haunted houses are quite common. We started off scared of the ghost but thought, well,it’s gonna get us, it’s gonna get us. It’s massively frustrating when we’re woken up in the night, or when a door slams in our faces, but we cope OK. There are actually two spirits in our house. Dave is always here – he’s thought to be attached to us, not the house. He was the first spirit to reveal himself. A psychic told us his name, and his frustration that we weren’t acknowledging him. But things have calmed down a lot. It’s like living with an invisible housemate, who’s made it known that his favourite food is spam!When we moved in I had really bad headaches. We’ve recently discovered that Dave passed away in a car accident – he had a blow to the side of his head, the same side as my headaches. The other spirit, Andy, is the late brother of the psychic medium who investigated our house – we think Dave and Andy have actually bonded! My scariest moment was when Ben was away. I was startled awake to the sound of growling in my ear. I started recording on my phone to document what had happened and watched as a spirit lted my hair from my shoulder. That felt too close for comfort.I sought advice from experts who told me to set boundaries with the spirits and it hasn’t happened again. I never feel alone in the house and I’ve come to love living with spirits. Sometimes it’s so quiet we wonderthey’ve gone. There’s a lot of activity when we’re stressed or anxious, so they must feed off our negative energy. Using a ouija board, I asked Dave and Andythey’d protect our unborn baby – they said yes. Dave was convinced the baby would be a boy. We recently found out the gender at a scan and he was right. I was gobsmacked! People probably think we’re absolute idiots, that we have demons in our house and we’re putting our unborn child at risk. But there’s no heaviness or bad vibes here. There’s le beyond death, and that’s all I’ve ever wanted to hear.Ben Hubbard says: aposAs a kid, I had a love-hate relationship with horror movies. I liked to get scared, but always had in the back of my mind that they weren’t real – now I’m living in my own version of a Hollywood blockbuster.  I remember seeing shadows out of the corner of my eye, or feeling someone watching me in my own home.But I was a sceptic – I wouldn’t believe it was a ghost, let alone two of them! When objects started moving in the house, I was terried. I’d seen The Conjuring movies – I thought we were going to die. Soon we were coming home to a pigsty – our possessions thrown around in a mess. So we decided to put up motion-activated cameras to capture Dave and Andy in action. One day, I watched a pair of scissors fly out of the kitchen drawer. I don’t want to think about what would have happened we were in the way at the time. A few weeks later, I woke up to use the loo during the night. I looked up to see the outline of a man standing right in front of me. My jaw hit the floor. I was definitely awake and my mind was in overdrive. It couldn’t be real – could it  We speak to Dave and Andy using a spirit board and a ghost-hunting app. They’re the budget options, because it’s not cheap chatting to ghosts! Dave loves winding me up. I was alone one day playing FIFA and saw something move out of the corner of my eye.I leapt up and left the house. Lainey came home hours later to find me sitting barefoot on the doorstep looking sad – I feel way more comfortable when Lainey is with me! Most people say our house feels happy and calm, but a few friends hate it. A mate offered to house-sit while we went away. A few hours into our journey, he rang to say he’d heard footsteps walking across the room. In the early hours, he rang again saying, “I’ve posted your keys through the door. I’m leaving.” Apparently he’d been lying in bed when the duvet was pulled away – that was the final straw. He bolted and hasn’t been back since. Movies show ghosts throwing people down the stairs – I’m so grateful that we don’t have a basement, that would be game over. But it’s not so bad. Weird things happen now and then but it’s OK, we’re not possessed! We post very real footage of our spirits online but not everyone is willing to accept it. We’re not sharing stuff to make people believe. It helps us understand what’s happening and we love being part ofa paranormal community. At first I was very fearful, but now I love our spirits.

The castle has been the location of regular ghost sightings and has a brutal backstory dating back to the th century. This TikTok clip shows off some of the history of the castle as well as giving viewers a glimpse of the interior and some of the features. As the ghost tour around the castle explains, the building has been home to some blood curdling tales, including murder and torture. One room of note that is featured in the clip is The Edward Room, where King Henry III is said to have stayed. One guest’s ghost meter rapidly lit up in certain areas of this room, alluding to the presence of some paranormal spirits. Supernatural experiences are said to be rather common at the castle, with guests reporting incidents of pushing, hair pulling, voices being heard and even sightings of numerous ghostly figures. Staff in the castle are also said to have heard a loud voice telling them to “get out”.The video, which was uploaded by TikTok user @rebbeebee, shows off ious stops on the ghost tour of the castle, which was completed in darkness. Viewers were quick to share their stories of the castle, with one user commenting: “I stayed there and it scared the s**t out of me, we loved it though.” Another commenter wrote: “As we were leaving the chapel, someone put their hand on my shoulder… I was the last one in the group… other things happened while we were there.” A third added: “Went on a ghost hunt there years ago really spooky place, we even explored the graveyard just at the start of the castle driveway.” Comment MORE ON SupernaturalChillFrisk\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Fancy an escape to the Chill newsletter for weekly inspiration and advice on UK holidays Sign Up!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old woman was out enjoying a meal with her family in a restaurant which was catered to families and young children, when a child aged around nine started yelling, running up and down the aisles and doing cartwheels. It was annoying but we just ignored him and carried on with our meal. His mother was sat at their table talking to the adults she was with and completing ignoring her son apart from occasionally telling him to come and finish his food, the woman wrote on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum.We were sat in a booth and I had my stuff on the bench next to me, including a hat. One of the many times he ran past our table, he stopped, picked up my hat and put it on. Just as the boy went to run off with the hat, the woman sharply told him, give that back right now, and he obliged, with an embarrassed look on his face. The woman went on to tell him it is extremely rude to take other peopleaposs things without asking, donapost do that again. The child then glanced over at his mum and caught her attention, prompting her to come over and see what was going on.

The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether she was justied in aposscoldingapos the child, and she was met with overwhelming support. I have four kids and I would be absolutely appalledthey acted this way in public, one Reddit user commented, while another added: Kid needs to learn some manners somehow and it seems like his mum isn’t going to be the one teaching him how to act properly in public. Kids shouldn’t be allowed to run around inside a restaurant for any reason, let alone do cartwheels, a third wrote. They could knock someone’s food over, hurt themselves or someone who’s just trying to do their job or enjoy a meal out.

The men put their lives and those of others at risk by forcing their way off the Airbus A in what police believe may have been a planned to enter Spain illegally. They appeared to push past medical and airline staff at a plane exit door after a brief struggle before running down the aircraft steps and disappearing into the darkness at Majorca’s busy Palma airport. A woman could be overheard shouting: “They’re escaping, they’re escaping, the lads are staying in Spain” as they fled the plane. The drama unfolded shortly after the Air Arabic Maroc-operated aircraft, which was heading from Casablanca to Istanbul in Turkey, made an unscheduled emergency landing in Majorca when a passenger “fell ill” and went into an apparent diabetic coma. The Moroccan man was rushed to hospital with a companion who promptly escaped the medical centre as the “sick” man was given a clean bill of health following a check-up. As he was being taken to Son Llatzer Hospital and the aircraft doors were open,  other passengers took advantage of the confusion to make their daring escape, forcing a shutdown of operations at the airport which lasted nearly four hours and caused chaos. Twelve of the  passengers who left the plane at Palma Airport remained unaccounted for last night after a central government spokeswoman confirmed several men all believed to be Moroccans had been intercepted in dferent parts of the island. Most were held in the municipality of Marratxi, a half-hour drive north-east of Palma, including four detained following a tip-off from a local who had seen them acting “suspiciously” in the street and linked them to the plane escape. The majority of the missing men are thought to be Moroccan although one has been described as Palestinian.  Spanish officials said they could not rule out the possibility the incident was an “orchestrated” coup to enter the country illegally in their first comments yesterday regarding the incident. But they said they had no evidence at this stage to point to the incident being planned beforehand and linked to a “deliberate” attempt by another passenger to fake a medical complaint. Responding to earlier reports a Moroccan man on board the Airbus A from Casablanca to Istanbul had exaggerated the seriousness of a diabetes problem so he could be taken to a hospital with a companion who vanished on arrival, a central government spokeswoman for the Balearic Islands said: “The protocol that is always applied in a medical emergency that the pilot of the plane requested was applied in this case. “It may be that this protocol is revised once the current investigation is concluded in the light of this unique event in our country. Revealing  of the  passengers who had abandoned the plane were still missing, Aina Calvo said: “All options are still on the table but we don’t have any information that enables us to affirm at this stage that we are dealing with an orchestrated operation by people who have entered Spain irregularly and formed part of a pre-conceived plan.”  Contradicting earlier information, she also insisted none of the passengers who had been intercepted had requested political asylum. Police sources said however they believed at least part of the group that fled the plane had planned their mission beforehand, lending support to the theory the unnamed passenger that sparked the medical emergency had invented or exaggerated his desperate state of health to facilitate the coup. Spanish airports authority Aena confirmed business had been resumed as normal in a tweet just before midnight on Friday, some three and a half hours after it revealed all normal airport operations had been suspended following the shock runway invasion. It confirmed yesterday morning on Saturday morning  flights scheduled to land at Palma had been erted - five to Barcelona, four to Ibiza, two to Menorca, one to Madrid Barajas and another to Valencia. Around  incoming and outbound flights, including several international flights, are said to have been delayed. The National Police and the Civil Guard, Spain’s two national police forces, are involved in the hunt for the runaways and are believed to be getting assistance from local town-hall employed police forces across the island.

Impact from the asteroid could be devastating, but thankfully, it dose not pose a threat to the planet. The asteroid will fly by the planet at a distance of . million kilometres - a distance greater than  times of that between the Earth and the moon.  Nereus is  metres long, which makes it larger than % of asteroids, but tiny compared to large asteroids, according to Space Reference. The asteroid orbits the sun every  days though it is predicted not to come close to the Earth again until March ,  and then November . Its closest approach will not happen for another  years in February . Discovered in  by US astronomer Eleanor F. Helin, Nereus is a member of the Apollo group of asteroids which are known for crossing the path of the Earth as it orbits the Sun. Scientists have considered missions to the asteroid, but plans have fallen through each time.  NASA proposed sending the Robotic Asteroid Shoemaker Rendezvousprobe and Japan assessed sending the robotic spacecraft Hayabusa to Nereus, but both ultimately chose other targets. It is not the first time large asteroids have entered the Earthaposs orbit, however. In September, an asteroid larger than Big Benaposs clock tower was set to crash through the Earth’s orbit, travelling at incredible speeds of ,mph. The rock, designated RL, is between  feet to  feet wide, came within ,, miles of Earth. For comparison, the Moon is located just , miles away. The asteroid is measured to be close enough to be around  lunar distances away - trips to the moon and back.

Troops held the competition over the weekend as part of efforts to boost the countryaposs defence capabilities, state media reported on Sunday.The drills were conducted on Saturday, state news agency KCNA said, and come as North Korea increasingly complains over what it sees as a double standard where its military activities invite international criticism when similar exercises by South Korea and the United States usually do not.Analysts say Pyongyang is seeking to normalise its defence activities with the aim of eventually winning international acceptance of its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile arsenals, which have been sanctioned by UN Security Council resolutions. Much of North Koreaaposs large conventional artillery force is deployed along the fortied border with South Korea, where they have the range to reach as far as the heavily populated capital city of Seoul.  The drills come at a time when the enthusiasm to undergo intensive training prevails throughout the Korean Peopleaposs Armyfor ushering in a new heyday in strengthening the state defence capabilities under the banner of self-defence”, KCNA reported. They were overseen by Pak Jong-chon, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the ruling Workersapos Pary of Korea, KCNA said.  Pak is a general long seen as a rising star in the countryaposs powerful military and a major player in its missile programme who was promoted to his current positions in September. General Rim Kwang-il, chief of the General Staff of the KPA, and commanders of the participating units, observed the drills with Pak, KCNA said. Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, was not present at the firing.  As soon as the firing orders were given by the commanders of the combined units, gun barrels to annihilate the enemy competitively shelled the target to accurately hit it, the report said. This comes as it was reported that North Korea can get all the uranium it needs for nuclear weapons through its existing Pyongsan mill. Satellite imagery of tailings piles suggests the country can produce far more nuclear fuel than it is, a new academic study concluded. Despite a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear weapons tests since , North Korea has said it is continuing to build its arsenal, and this year it appeared to have restarted a reactor that is widely believed to have produced weapons-grade plutonium. Research published last month in the journal Science  Global Security by researchers at Stanford University and an Arizona-based mining consulting company said: It is clear that the DPRK appears to have substantially more milling capacity than it has been using to date. This means that the DPRK could produce much greater quantities of milled natural uraniumdesired.

proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range as well as the percentage of that population covered.There is limited data available on vaccinations in pregnancy, however we do have monthly data on the number of people vaccinated by pregnancy trimester.Coronavirus in Scotland # track the spread with these charts\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland # track the spread with these charts# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials coronavirus-in-scotland-track-the-spread-in-these-charts-and-maps embed # secretanuYMBbtv\" data-secret\"anuYMBbtv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Coronavirus in Scotland – here are the key demographics\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland – here are the key demographics# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials coronavirus-in-scotland-here-are-the-key-demographics embed # secretbLHWrhpUp\" data-secret\"bLHWrhpUp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Let us knowthere is something  you think we should be tracking by emailing lkelly@dctmedia"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures october 15 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowLike a scene from the heyday of Para Handy and the Clyde puffers, the VIC makes her sedate way from Crinan towards Bellanoch Bridge.Lochgilphead reader Rhona Young kindly sent us her photograph, taken on Saturday October  as the Vic was travelling on the Crinan Canal en route to Cairnbaan."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures october 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThis week we feature a series of photographs by Ardrishaig resident James Bowe.Taken on Friday October  during an early morning walk to Cairnbaan, James captured the scene as the sun rose on a beautul day after a spell of rain.

We created two or three good chances but in the second half we conceded early from a mistake and then ran out of steam but overall I was happy with the performance.ldquoWe had four players making their debut, Andrew Mackay, Ben Viola and Lewis Grahame who all signed from Penicuik and Ben Brady, who had just been released by St Mirren played as a trialist.ldquoBenpicked up an injury the second-half and had to go off. Hersquos had issues with his ankle all season and went over on it. He didnrsquot train on Monday night, so wersquoll see how he is for Saturday.ldquoWe have another three players lined up that we like the look of but whether they will be signed and available for Saturday, I donrsquot know right now. Hopefully one or two may be able to play.ldquoSaturday will be a massive game for the club. The Edinburgh Uni and Gretna games probably came a bit too early for us.\"It would have been betterwersquod had three or four weeks with the players first, but it is what it is. I watched Gretnarsquos Scottish Cup game against Berwick Rangers and have received some reports on them but they have a new manager so their style of play may have changed..removeldquoBut Irsquove been delighted with the response of the players so far. There has been a good reaction and there was a real enthusiasm in training.

scrapped.Argyll and Bute Council agreed to continue the Ring and Ride service whilst it takes time to look for an alternative.Councillor Rory Colville, community spokesman for Argyll and Bute Council, said: #We are responding to the concerns of the people who need this service most.#It will continue in its current form for as long as it takes to make an informed decision about changes and we will make people aware of what will be provided in the future.#No timescale was given as to whether this would be before next May#s elections.In last year#s budget, the service was earmarked for the axe at the time, but the council gave assurances alternative arrangements would be put in place.Councillor John Semple said: #I am glad to see that finally some common sense seems to be filtering through – only three weeks ago the administration voted to continue with this cut.#I will continue to look after the interests of the most vulnerable people in this community as the administration#s plans

information.She said: #I welcome the announcement, at long last, of the ferry service, although I am disappointed Caledonian MacBrayne was not allowed to run it.#She went on to ask: #For how long does Sea Containers have the contract  Is the Secretary of State expecting the service eventually to run all year, so that we can build up not only a good tourist service, but a good import and export trade #Mr Forsyth responded: #It was important for the new route to be established. It was possible to achieve that with a private sector operator taking the risk, which means that CalMac#s available public capital and running costs can be deployed on maintaining other services and introducing new ones.#It must be the right approach to use the state#s nationalised service and the scarce resources available to it as wisely as possible.#That was what lay behind our thinking.#He went on to say that he would write to Mrs Michie regarding the contract.Mrs Michie commented: #It is important we get the full facts about this service so that we can judge whether this really is value for money as the government claims.#FIFTY YEARS AGOEmergency sea rescue services in the Firth of Clyde could have been victims of another hoax on Friday.For the Campbeltown leboat, three naval vessels and a Dakota aircraft spent nearly six hours searching Kilbrannan Sound and its approaches for a boat reported to have been sinking off Campbeltown.The drama began at lunchtime when the Campbeltown leboat mechanic, Mr Alistair Gilchrist, intercepted a wireless message which read: #Mayday Boy Danny sinking  degrees off Campbeltown.#Kildonan Coastguard Station, Troon Leboat Station and Portpatrick Radio also picked up the call the boat#s name, however, was not mentioned in the message received by the other three stations.Then a full-scale search operation swung into operation. Along with the leboat, the warship HMS Eastbourne, Fishery Protection vessel Vigilant and the US Navy ship Victoria began combing the area between the south of Arran and Kintyre.They were joined later in the search by a Dakota aircraft from Prestwick.An RAF patrol vessel stood by at Campbeltown.Campbeltown leboat reported the discovery of a large piece of timber. It was, however, too heavy to lt aboard and it was not thought to be part of possible wreckage.Then, after six hours, the search was called off. The plane and boats had covered an extensive area of sea.Coastguards using mobile equipment searched along the shores of Arran and Kintyre.Nothing was seen.Police in Campbeltown began investigations into the matter shortly after the leboat put to sea their enquiries are continuing.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAuchencorvie United, one of the teams that came into being in the rural area as a result of the formation of sports clubs among agricultural workers, made their first appearance in local competitive football last Saturday afternoon.Drumlemble supplied the opposition and had a comparatively easy victory by four goals to nil.Auchencorvie had several players of some promise but, as a whole, the team was sadly wanting in science and judgement and the lesson of their first experience should impress on them the fact that mere lusty vigour is not sufficient to win on the football field.In the first half, Drumlemble did not press their undoubted superiority unduly, being content with a one-goal lead at the interval. James Munro was the scorer.In the second half they added three more to the total, D Thomson having two and A Kerr one.At the opening concert of the winter session of the Scottish Clans# Association of

goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29 2021","story":"More must be done to prevent the continued spate of

Photographs from the early days up to  are from the collections of the late Robert Grieves and from John Sinclair, two indefatigable photographers whose material is of national Scottish importance.

It was the lockdown which entrenched this: screens were the way to connect with people, friends, family and even school learning.They became the default activity and I believe itrsquos become an unhealthy addiction for us and as the nights have drawn in, with less opportunity for outside activity and walks in nature, this addiction has the risk of becoming even worse.I know screens are not all bad, they have benefits and advantages too. . . hell knows, I spend so much time on screens myself.I think we can be too hard on ourselves at times and Irsquom aware of that. Irsquod go to say that some screen time is now important for a iety of reasons. I also recognise that in the last two years they have become a leline for many people.But lately I have been trying my best to practise what I preach as a storyteller. I want to find ways to wean my kids, and myself, from screens to find a healthier balance, a more personal connection which lts our mental health rather than sapping it.Itrsquos not been easy. When the kids are asked to come off screens, they often explode with what I call screen rage. Itrsquos aswe are cutting an umbilical cord and removing their le support system, and they must fight and protest to restore it. The drama is predictable and tiring, but the good news is itrsquos usually relatively short-lived. Irsquove discovered that kids are eventually glad when they have been taken off excessive use of screens.The trick is to have something engaging to replace it with, as well as to model it myself. Thatrsquos the thing, itrsquos so easy to be a hypocrite to tell my kids itrsquos the end of screen time, while using my phone or writing on my laptop.ldquoBut you are still on a screen, dad! was the rebuke from my astute eight-year-old daughter recently. And she was right, so the rules have to apply to me and my we too.We are slowly getting there. We have no screens before bedtime now, instead a family storytelling session. The hardest part has been establishing the routine with so much to do. But now the kids look forward to it and help make the living room cosy in preparation.And I feel the benefits too. It helps me close down that ruminator in my head, which constantly reminds me of how much I have to do, emails I need to reply to, deadlines I need to meet. Instead I become focused on the moment, on the fact Irsquom sharing the attention of my loved ones and we are all telling stories.I know this now does sound overly romantic, but the thing is nothing can compare to these moments of connection, such as the magic of listening to my wee boy tell another spontaneous chapter of his tale of the haunted pizzeria, or listening to my girls weave a story rooted in their experiences of the day or a favoured fable from their earlier childhood. And Irsquove discovered my we Kate is a good storyteller when given the opportunity.Maybe it felt awkward at first, that we were doing it because I thought we should be rather than because we all wanted to. But that awkwardness soon gave way to excited expectation and genuine enjoyment of the experience. And the darkness helps, itrsquos a blanket which adds atmosphere and allows us to use fairy lights and candles, so in that sense the cold and dark of this time of year is a huge advantage: itrsquos the season for cosy storytelling.The flicker of screens still shine more regularly than the storytelling candles in our house. But the balance is slowly changing. Hallowersquoen helped, it seemed such a natural time for storytelling. And I think I can say we have now established our storytelling sessions as a regular family tradition. When it happens, it feels like ancient magic has entered our house.I run storytelling sessions with parents and many share the challenges I recognise in my own family. All families are dferent, of course, and no child is the same. Buta family storytelling tradition can be established, everyone feels the benefits. Evenonly every now and then, they will be times of real connection that everyone will remember.Soyou fancy trying it and would like my short guide with some reflections and tips, drop me an email. Or maybe you have tips and experiences yoursquod like to share recently, a parent told me that bath time was storytelling time in her house, as she sat on the toilet telling favoured tales to her young children!

There have been countless books about Orwell, one of the most esteemed of last centuryrsquos British writers, but the American memoirist, Rebecca Solnit, has taken this under-emphasised aspect of his le to spin a new angle on his personality, work and outlook. It is a timely and original reappraisal, adding an extra dimension to a figure renowned for his political acuity who, it emerges, was equally interested in flowers.As with her previous works, Solnit is part of the story. She writes that Homage to Catalonia, Orwellrsquos account of his involvement in the Spanish Civil War, shaped her book Savage Dreams: ldquoHe had been one of my principal literary influences, but I had not gotten to know more about him than what he revealed in the books and whatever set of assumptions was ambient. Thatrsquos a sentence Orwell would have been incapable of writing.Following serious illness, and under instructions from her doctor to rest, Solnit left Calornia to visit Orwellrsquos cottage in the Hertfordshire village of Wallington. This was where he and his first we Eileen OrsquoShaughnessy began married le in . When Solnit visited, a few of the roses he planted were still flourishing.In this rustic setting Orwell experimented with flowers and vegetables, hens and goats, while also turning the front room into a village shop. The reality of this romantic bolthole was far from dreamy. Guests found the place so cold, even in June, that weekends were an endurance test. In one of his domestic essays, Orwell commented on the pleasures of May, which included ldquonot wearing underclothes. Many who visited might have been grateful for his cast-offs.Solnit has strong opinions on the signicance of gardening and husbandry in Orwellrsquos le: ldquoA garden offers the opposite of the disembodied uncertainties of writing hellip In an age of lies and illusions, the garden is one way to ground yourself in the realm of the processes of growth and the passage of time, the rules of physics, meteorology, hydrology, and biology, and the realms of the senses. Among much , Orwellrsquos Roses is an exercise ndash not entirely successful ndash in fathoming why people grow attached to the land.Barnhill on Jura, where George Orwell wrote and also gardenedWeaving Orwellrsquos biography sketchily throughout, Solnit is more at ease in the realm of ideas than of gardens. Here, she feels on shaky ground. She does not think like a gardener, nor seem to appreciate its meaning for those who immerse themselves in their own patch of the great outdoors. In Wallington, and later on his sprawling acres on Jura, Orwell kept a detailed diary, noting the progress of his vegetables and fruit trees, how the daffodils were flowering, the number of eggs he had collected, how the goats were faring, and so on. Solnit seems puzzled by this, especially when he asked his we or sister to keep up the diary when he was absent: ldquoItrsquos not clear why he kept these detailed records hellip.Yet this is often what gardeners do, noting what works, when best to plant, or prune, or harvest. Not every diary Orwell kept, not every line he wrote, had a profound political or intellectual purpose. The enormous importance of gardening, to him, might be best summed up in a line from his essay on Mahatma Gandhi: ldquoOur job is to make le worth living on this earth, which is the only earth we have. The soil, and the wildle it nurtured, were for him a source of tangible joy and contentment.Solnitrsquos version of Orwellrsquos le is not intended as a full-scale biography. Instead, its aspirations lie in the author letting her mind roam freely on the connections between Orwellrsquos love of nature and its beauty and his political ideas, between the meaning of cultivating the land in our time, as well as his. In some ways the link is simple and obvious. In Why I Write, one of his best-known and most frequently quoted essays, he wrote: ldquoI could not do the work of writing a book, or even a long magazine article,it were not also an aesthetic experience.At one point Solnit describes Orwellrsquos essay, A Good Word for the Vicar of Bray, as ldquoa triumph of meandering. Orwellrsquos Roses is equally discursive, leaping from Orwell to the Mexican photographer of roses Tina Modotti, or Stalinrsquos insistence on growing lemons out of season in icy Moscow. Some of her literary digressions cover well-trodden ground, such as the erotic photography of Robert Mapplethorpe. Most of them suggest a butterfly-catcher swiping the air, hoping to net something memorable.The urge to wring as much meaning as possible from her material might explain rather too many laboured passages, such as her description of Orwellrsquos declining health: ldquoYou could say that the tuberculosis bacteria had made a garden of his lungs and were flourishing there, feeding on him as though the soft tissue of his lungs was fertile topsoil.Compared to the clarity and elegance of her last book, Recollections of My Non-Existence, Orwellrsquos Roses is heavy-footed, quixotic and uneven. Yet despite its flaws it has one great strength. Recognising the importance of gardening to Orwellrsquos soul and imagination prompted Solnit toto his novels with fresh eyes. The result was to discover hidden depths: ldquoIf you dig into Orwellrsquos work, you find a lot of sentences about flowers and pleasures and the natural world hellip These sentences are less ringing, less prophetic than the political analysis, but they are not unrelated to it, and they have their own poetics, their own power, and their own politics.Orwell never lost sight of what gardening can achieve, compared to writing, politics, or almost any other endeavour. Often, he was prophetic. As COP turns minds to the future, few of his ideas appear more prescient than his injunction on how best to make a mark: ldquothe planting of a tree, specially one of the long-living hardwood trees, is a gt which you can make to posterity at almost no cost and with almost no trouble, andthe tree takes root it will far outlive the visible effect of any of your other actions, good or evil."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13174037.jpg?type=article-full","title":"review-thx-onyx-portable-digital-analogue-audio-converter","story":"A portable digital to analogue audio converter .Good points During development of smartphones and computers, manufacturers have a lot to pack in and certain aspects, such as audio quality components like DACs, often take a back seat or are omitted entirely.These devices take digital files and present them to analogue audio output equipment allowing our ears to pick up the sound waves.The Onyx is a dedicated DAC adapter offering more power than the converters built into smartphones and laptops.

Ullirsquos Steading was then, as it is now, a gentle oasis amid a harsh, mountainous landscape, but drive north from the town, over the spine of the Rhue peninsula, and you enter another world.Ardmair is a magnicent spot. From the camp-site a spit of white shingle curves gracefully out into the bay pointing towards the sanctuary of Isle Martin. Beyond, protecting the bay from the Minch gales, the Summer Isles float alluringly on their sea of green. Flocks of dunlin and ringed plover feed on the salt flats, gulls wheel overhead and brightly coloured fishing boats bob and dip on the water, but for all these attractions of sea and shore it is a mountain which dominates the scene.An extensive wall of weathered Torridonian sandstone commands the northern shore of the bay, a relic of one of the most ancient land masses in the world. The long sandstone barrier runs from Garbh Choireachain to Speicin Coinnich, and is collectively known as Ben Mor Coigach. The hillrsquos protective cap of Cambrian quartzite has long since gone, but the bare bones of this venerable relic still rise straight from the sea to nearly  metres, a long wall of seamed buttresses, gullies and clfs.While that seaward wall is impressive, itrsquos really only a front, hiding an intricate, complex system of peaks, ridges, corries and lochans. This area of Coigach is a gem. Unspoiled and challenging, it begins to reveal itself more fully as you drive further north. Ben Mor Coigach, at m, is the highest summit, but the other main peak of the area, Sgurr an Fhidhleir, rises to a sharp and dramatic point. Itrsquos a high eyrie of a summit, the culmination of a huge blade of rock that rises from the bare moorland close to the reflective waters of Lochan Tuath.The traverse of these two hills brings together all the best characteristics of a walk which blends sea and mountain in that distinctive combination that you only find on Scotlandrsquos western seaboard. Therersquos a peculiar quality to the blend here in Coigach, as though the spaciousness of the vast seascape emphasises the height of the hill, and you catch a notion yoursquore mounting a staircase to the heavens.Indeed, itrsquos perhaps not too fancul to imagine the traverse of Ben Mor Coigachrsquos long south-west ridge beyond Ardmair Bay as a high-level promenade to Tir nan Og, the fabled Land of the Blest beyond the shimmering ocean of the Celtic twilight.At Drumrunie junction on the A a minor road runs west towards Achiltibuie. As everyone  heads off to climb Stac Pollaidh, or fester on the pale yellow sands of Achnahaird Bay, park your vehicle and cross the river just east of Loch Lurgainn. A faint path, rising steadily on the right bank of the Allt Claonaidh, will take you as far as Lochan Tuath, which mirrors the mighty north-west prow of Sgurr an Fhidhleir, the peak of the fiddler. Walkers donrsquot follow the prow: thatrsquos the domain of rock climbers whorsquoll find a long and exposed climb of Very Severe standard.South of the prow, a prominent heather-filled gully climbs steeply up to the bealach between The Fiddler and Ben Mor Coigach and from there easy slopes lead to the summit of Sgurr an Fhidhleir, a stunning place with magnicent views over the Inverpolly peaks ndash Cul Mor, Cul Beag and the improbable outline of Stac Pollaidh. This hill has been described as a lsquomountain straight out of a fairy talersquo, with a ragged and spiky crest looking for all the world like some primeval stegosaurus.Retrace your steps to the broad bealach and climb the easy, grassy slopes to Ben Mor Coigach. The long south-west ridge towards Garbh Choireachan is the highlight of this glorious walk. Enjoy the succession of rocky towers and sandy paths which make this ridge such a delight and take time to enjoy the views out over the Summer Isles and on a good day, across the Minch to Harris and Lewis. Given reasonably clear weather yoursquoll see the Cuillin of Skye, the Torridons, An Teallach, the Beinn Dearg hills and the magnicent spread of northern hills from Inverpollaidh to Assynt. Immediately below your feet lies Isle Martin, which was gted to the locally based Isle Martin Trust by the RSPB in the spirit of lsquoland reform and devolutionrsquo. This little nature reserve was the first land the RSPB has transferred to community ownership.Itrsquos well worth while scrambling out to the end of the ridge before making your way back to the summit of Ben Mor Coigach, and eventually over Beinn Tarsuinn and back to the start at the end of a glorious walk.ROUTE PLANNERMap: OS :, Landranger sheet  .Distance:  miles km.Time: - hours.Start finish: Minor road to Achiltibuie, at GR: NC.Information: Ullapool TIC,  .Route: Cross the river with care and follow the right bank of the Allt Clonaidh to Lochan Tuath.

When the big winger was eventually brought down, Australia went off their feet, but Scotland failed to capitalise on that penalty in the danger zone.Finally, the deadlock was broken on  minutes when Scotland passed up three easy points and went to the corner instead, getting their reward with aHamish Watsontry off a clever move initiated by middle-jumperJamie Ritchietapping down toGrant Gilchristat the front. There was a hold-up as referee Romain Poite and the TMO discussed a possible obstruction, but the on-field decision ultimately stood.Australia came back hard but were left frustrated by having two tries chalked off in fairly quick succession. First, wingerTom Wrightwent over on the left, only for play to be pulled back for an off-the-ball tackle earlier in the passage of play. Then captain Michael Hooper wriggld under the posts, but tight-headAllan Alaalatoawas judged to have caughtMatt Fagersonwith a swinging arm at the previous ruck.To add to the away teams sense of grievance, they were also reduced to  men for the next  minutes with Alaalatoa being sent to the sin-bin, but they didnt let that distract them, and James OConnor finally got Australia off the mark on  minutes with a well-struck penalty after Matt Fagerson was penalised for going off his feet.A massive collision whenSam Johnsoncarried intoTaniela Tupouleft the Australianreplacement tight-head clearly concussed and he had to be replaced, meaning Australia had two loose-heads at the next scrum, but it stacked up and after a powerful burst through the middle byIzaia Perese, the ball was sent back the way it had come andRob Leotacharged through a gaping hole between Pierre Schoeman and Sam Skinner to score, with OConnor adding the conversion.Scotland looked to bounce back immediately, with Johnson looping round to create an opening on the left and Price once again on hand to keep keep the move going, but that attack floundered whenMatt Fagersonlost possession in contact.There was no shortage of cautious kicking for territory during this third quarter. Then, after an excellent spiral byFinn Russell set up a line-out on Australias , slick hands gave van der Merwe the chance of a gallop on the left, beforeNic White did well to bring the big man down. Play swept back to the right, but Hoggs pass to Graham was cut-out by Wright.Eventually, the pressure told, with hookerEwan Ashmanmarking his international debut by carrying on the prolic scoring record of his Scotland Under-s days with a brilliantly taken try under pressure in the left corner.Australia got their noses back in front when OConnor nailed the points from -yards out and directly in front of the posts after Watson was penalised as he tried to pilfer possession over a tackle, but Russell responded in kind with just over  minutes to go after a collapsed scrum, and thats how it stayed until the end.Scotland closed out the game well. There was some good work fromJamie Hodgsonand Ritchie when they tag-teamedKurtley Bealeto prevent the recycle and win a vital scrum, while replacementsKyle SteynandJosh Baylissndash on debut ndash both won excellent turnovers.The Bayliss turnover prompted a sweeping attack involving Russell, Hogg and Steyn, before George Horne went himself when a pass inside looked the better option, and when the ball was recycled Russell over-cooked a cross-field kick and it went out on the full.It was a shame the Scots couldnt finish with a flourish, but nobody of a tartan hue will be losing much sleep over that."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13179274.jpg?type=article-full","title":"cop26-glasgow-road-closures-end","story":"The unique event sees Glasgow welcoming around  world leaders as well as some , delegates from across the world and climate activists.Protests and demonstrations as well as major road closures and restrictions have caused chaos for those travelling either to or around Glasgow.Major travel routes such as the Clyde expressway and sections of the M have been closed throughout the event, with the nearby Minerva Street - West Greenhill Place, which is located right next to the Exhibition centre train station, also closed.People are urged to plan their journeys in advance and drivers in particular are being asked to look at travelling outside peak times, considerthe journey is necessary at that time or at all and leaving the car, opting to travel in a dferent way to reduce congestion.Public transport in Glasgow throughout the event has been busier than normal.The UN Climate Change Conference will end on Friday, November , however despite the ending of the talks, some road closures will remain in the days following.Here is when the all of the COP road closures will endFull details of road closures and alternative routes can be found HERE."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive accessas we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive pound for two months offer here.From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expectground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content ndash as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just pound for two monthshere.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as ldquounsatisfactory on pollution, according to data from the ScottishEnvironmentProtection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oilcompanies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as ldquovery poor in .

Itowed pound.m, including over pound, to his management firm.He was brought in after the last civilian Clyde shipyard under tyoon Jim McColl went into administration following a dispute with Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd - the taxpayer-funded company which buys and leases publicly owned CalMacs ships on behalf of the Scottish government - and as the price of the construction of two leline ferries under a poundm fixed price contract more than doubled.Ferguson Marines financial collapse in August,  led to a state takeover, while the delivery of two leline island ferries MV Glen Sannox and Hull  which were due online in the first half of  will be over four years late.Mr McColl went on to blame repeated design changes by CMAL for the issues in building the vessels for operator CalMac, which is also publicly-owned.Earlier this year it emerged that Ferguson Marine had racked up poundm of losses in just four months of nationalisation.And last month there was a warning the ferries could be further delayed as Mr Hair flagged up concerns over data systems used to run the nationalised business.He also highlighted a potential vulnerability regarding running gear installed on Glen Sannox, which has been sitting idle in the water at the Port Glasgow shipyard for years.Details of Mr Hairs invoiced fees, including expenses, show that in the nearly two years between August,  and July,  he earned pound,,. It was revealed hereceives costs for living in Scotland.His over pound,-a-year payments towers over the pound,-a-year salary of the First Minister.Just six had been approached for the job, after global consultant group Price Waterhouse Cooperadvised ministers of suitable people with experience of turnaround in comparable industries.The Scottish Government in explaining the recruitment process has admitted that after consideration of CVs, senior officials eventually interviewed three people \"by phone\" and consequently concluded that Tim Hair had the \"requisite skills and experience to perform the role\".It has been confirmed that availability of candidates was \"important\" as some were in existing roles and would not be able to start promptly.But Highlands and Islands MSPEdward Mountain, the former convenor of the rural economy and connectivity committee which branded the ferry management process a \"catastrophic failure\" after an inquiry has strongly criticised the recruitment process.He said: ldquoI find it absolutely bizarre, considering the importance of this job, that the interviews for the shortlisted candidates were not undertaken on a face-to-face basis.\"And it appears that the Scottish Government appointed who was available at the time. Most of the time though, the best turnaround directors are already fully employed.ldquoI am not convinced that the Scottish Government carried out an adequate interview process or obtained sufficient references in their search for a turnaround director.\"The deal to bring in Mr Hair, the former chief of engineering firm Chamberlain, was overseen by a two-man  - acting director of for economic development Richard Rollison and Transport Scotland chief executive Roy Brannen.Both had been briefed by independent specialist advisers PwC which had also advised the Scottish Government over options for action over the perilous state of shipbuilders Ferguson Marine before it fell into administration in August,  and was subject of a state takeover.The appointment was signed off by then finance secretary Derek Mackay.But ministers have said they were unable to list his previous appointments and his accomplishments since  as the exact details were covered by non-disclosure agreements. They will only say that he \"led multiple turnarounds in several industrial sectors\".According to Mr Hairs CV he was interim chief executive of polymer products manufacturers Applied Composites Group for  months between October  and August  It went bust ten months later owing pound.m after he left. Liquidators said there had been no claims made from secured creditors.In its final set of financial accounts for the year to September, , prepared in June , auditors KPMG raised concerns about the business continuing as a going concern saying \"there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast signicant doubt over the use of that basis for a period of at least  months\". It had suffered a pound, loss after tax.During that time, in June, he oversaw a subsidiary Icon Aerospace that manufactures rubber products for the aerospace, defence and industrial sectors and counts the likes of Airbus, Boeing and Rolls-Royce among its clients, to move into a new research and development base in Nottinghamshire. It was expected to secure  jobs and create a further .He said at the time: \"Icon Aerospace Technology supplies critical parts to the aerospace and defence industry and we look forward to continued growth.\"A year later, Applied Composites Group appointed a voluntary liquidator. Mr Hairs company Melville Management Limited was one of those which was owed money to the tune of pound,..Unsecured creditor claims totalled pound, - but all failed to receive any reimbursement, according to liquidators EY, as \"no funds have been realised\".In January, , Icon, which featured on Michael Portillos Great British Railway Journeys, was bought by Integrated Polymer Solutions , a business based in Long Island, Calornia and is still operating.Mr Mountain, a Scottish Conservative MSP, businessman and former soldier added: ldquoI also question whether the Scottish Government prioritised shipbuilding expertise as part of the role. Tim Hairrsquos professional experience working as a marine engineer on a cruise ship some thirty years ago is signicantly dferent from constructing modern passenger ferries. ldquoIt is also clear that the financial package offered to Tim Hair by the Scottish Government saw him receive signicantly more thanhe had been appointed by a recruitment firm, who would have carried out more due diligence.ldquoHaving been in business for forty years, I know that in the first six months of a turnaround directorrsquos appointment they are tackling the problem. After that period, they can become part of that problem.ldquoOverall, I have little confidence that these ferries will be delivered on time and within the latest cost estimates.Ministers have said: \"Tim has signicant experience in the engineering and automotive sectors, has led a number of business turnarounds and transformations and is a member of the Institute of Marine Engineering Science  Technology and the Institute of Turnaround.\"The primary requirement when recruiting the Turnaround Director was experience of turning around engineering businesses with an emphasis on a collaborative approach to re-set the relationship with customers and Tim Hair was selected on this basis. Additionally, Tim Hair had shipping experience in his early career.His contract was for an initial period of two to three months with an option to roll forward on a monthly basis but with a four week notice period.His pay rate was cut by % in February  and is now as pound.In a question-and-answer briefing for Mr Mountain, ministers were asked what Mr Hairs marine engineering experience was and why it was specically relevant to shipbuilding and Ferguson Marine.The Scottish Government stated that he had been a marine engineer between  and  for PO Princess Cruises and that he was a member of the Institute of Marine Engineering Science  Technology.\"Tim has signicant experience in the engineering and automotive sectors, has led a number of business turnarounds and transformations and is a member of the Institute of Turnaround. The primary requirement when recruiting the Turnaround Director was experience of turning around engineering businesses with an emphasis on a collaborative approach to re-set the relationship with customers and Tim Hair was selected on this basis,\" it said.Ministers were also asked in endorsing Mr Hairs appointment, whether PwC confirmed they had direct experience of working with Mr Hair. The Scottish Government responded: \"PwC completed a background check on Tim Hair which raised no concerns and he has been known to PwC Partners in England for over  years.\" PwC were not approached for a reference. Instead references were obtained from non-executive directors covering Mr Hairs career since .A Ferguson Marine spokesman said: \"The recruitment was a Scottish Government exercise and the shipyard canrsquot comment.\"A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoThe Scottish Government appointed the Turnaround Director in August  following a competitive and robust recruitment exercise as part of the process to take the Ferguson Marine shipyard into public control.ldquoTim Hair has a track record of stabilising companies in dficult situations. He has a wealth of experience across a range of sectors including oil and gas, manufacturing, aerospace and the automotive sector.ldquoA benchmarking exercise was conducted as part of the recruitment process to identy market rates. The Turnaround Directorrsquos agreed fee was well within the benchmark and consistent with market rates which reflect the highly specialised nature of a role that requires senior level experience and solid track record of transforming struggling businesses.ldquoSince Mr Hairrsquos appointment clear business improvements have been made at the yard, despite the pandemic, and more than  jobs have been created since February . The Scottish Government stands firm on its commitment to the ferries, the workforce and the yard."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmPapdale Nursery will be closed tomorrow, while Papdale Primary School will be running at a reduced service, Orkney Islands Council has confirmed this Sunday evening.

It is understood that at least one class within every year group except P is affected by the spread.The two authorities confirmed, this Thursday evening, that any decision to shut the school would be a collective one — but it has not yet reached that point. The only caveat to this is in the eventuality that staff numbers are so depleted, the council has no option but to close Papdale, or reduce teaching hours.As of early this afternoon, only two members of staff have been confirmed to have the virus.In a statement this evening, OIC#s executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, said: “The school remains open, and the situation is being managed and monitored with the advice and guidance of NHS Orkney Public Health.“Our aim is to keep the school open as long as possible to provide learning for those pupils who are well. We are working on a daily basis with Public Health evaluating the numbers and should it reach a point whereby it is felt necessary for a partial or full closure, then that decision will be made collectively.“However,staffing falls to a point whereby it is no longer possible to safely manage the pupil numbers in school — as happened in Stronsay Junior High School recently – then we, as the council, can take the decision to close or offer a rolling programme of reduced hours across the school.“I, again, thank everyone for continuing to answer our plea for children who are well and not displaying any COVID symptoms to still attend at school as this is vital for their education and social wellbeing.”The authorities have confirmed that a further ten PCR tests have also been requested in connection with Papdale Primary at this time, and contact tracing is ongoing. Parents with children attending the school have been urged to undertake twice-weekly lateral flow testing on both themselves and their little ones.Of the  pupils at the school,  pupils were absent on Thursday from the school — a drop from  on Wednesday. According to OIC, the reason many of these pupils remained at home was due to the COVID- situation —  whether for the purpose self-isolating, or because they are symptomatic and awaiting a PCR test. A small number of parents have also chosen not to send their child children to school.Warn and inform letters have now been sent to the parents and carers of children in all affected classes within P, P, P, P, P and P, in line with Scottish Government and Public Health guidance.In addition, Papdale#s head teacher, Wendy Bowen, has written to all parents to reassure that all necessary mitigating steps are being taken.Across Orkney, a total of  new positive cases have been reported in today#s daily figures.According to NHS Orkney, these cases are a mixture of household contacts, travel and working environment contacts amongst others. The health authority has has said that this continued rise in cases is not unexpected.NHS Orkney consultant of public health, Sara Lewis said: “We are continuing to see cases riseand this is another day of high case numbers for Orkney, but we want to reassure the community that we are managing these cases.#Although, we do ask that you continue to follow the guidance in place, ensuring good ventilationindoors, washing hands, wearing face coverings and keeping a safe distance from those out with your household,possible.

While some were self-isolating after being contact traced, others stayed home from school as they awaited a PCR test. A small number of parents have also chosen not to send their child or children to school.OIC#s education department says it has been responding to the cases at Papdale in a manner set out by  Scottish Government and Public Health guidelines. This involved the send out of targeted “warn and inform letters”  to parents of children in the affected classes — P,  and . These letters advised them of the situation at the school. In addition, head teacher Wendy Bowen, has written to all parents to reassure that all necessary mitigating steps are being taken.Mrs Bowen said: “Orkney and our school communities have fared well during the pandemic and it’s only in recent months that we have started to see a signicant rise in cases to the point that we are now witnessing a much wider community transmission, as confirmed by NHS Orkney Public Health.#I want to reassure all members of the school family that we do understand your concerns — we are all part of the wider Orkney community — and we all wish to keep each other as safe as possible.“We are following Scottish Government and Public Health guidance and sent ‘warn and inform’ letters to the children in the affected year groups. These being P, P and P.  Should other year groups be affected letters will be sent to them.“We continue to follow the mitigations that we have put in place as per the guidance. Classes affected have been deep cleaned each evening. Children are being asked to only bring essential items into school.“If your child has no symptoms, you can test your child with a lateral flow test. Should your child record a positive lateral flow test then the whole household should isolate and book a PCR test.“We would ask at this time that you are vigilant to the symptoms of COVID    Should your child have symptoms book a PCR test and your household should isolate.

The past  months have been so challenging for all manner of reasons, but last year in particular, our children missed out on a so much of their educational journey and social interaction which is so important for their well-being.“We would stress that it is vital for secondary pupils and all staff to continue participating in the twice-weekly testing, to log the results online and for everyone  in the community to stick to the guidance of wearing face coverings when inside, keeping the required distance from others and to maintain handwashing and sanitising.”If you develop COVID- symptoms, however mild, oryou have a positive lateral flow test, you must immediately self-isolate with your household and book a PCR test.This is regardless of your vaccination status.You can book a PCR test by calling the COVIDAssessment Centre on  .NHS Orkney is urging the community to continue with twice-weekly lateral flow tests for anyone who doesn’t have COVID symptoms, and to record these results online.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But the duty is meaningless.ldquoIf I was a water company and every year I reduced the amount of sewage I dumped by  ,th I would be making a lsquoprogressive reductionrsquo but I could carry on dumping shit for , years.A total of  Conservative MPs rebelled last month to support the Duke of Wellingtonrsquos initial proposal, with one of this group telling the PA news agency they are happy with the new Government amendment.But Green Party peer Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb said the Government concession was ldquonot good enough as it failed to stipulate measurements or metrics for the reduction required by water companies.She told PA: ldquoThe Government is running scared of the water companies and their owners when what they should be doing is thinking about the health of people and the environment.Lady Jones added: ldquoItrsquos a typical Government fudge to make their MPs think theyrsquore doing the right thing.The Bill as a whole seeks to write environmental principles into UK law for the first time, following Brexit.It is currently in the parliamentary stage known as ldquoping-pong, where a piece of legislation moves between the Commons and Lords until agreement can be reached.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This is extremely good news for our communities as we seek to position ourselves as Low Carbon islands.“COP in Glasgow will soon set the global decarbonisation agenda and, as host for the Scottish round of Zero Carbon race series, Extreme E, the Outer Hebrides will again be punching above its weight in climate terms.#It is particularly fitting that an island group on the Atlantic frontier with the most to lose from Climate Change in terms of extreme weather events and rising sea levels has been selected to host this race and Extreme E principles fit well with our aspirations to rapidly decarbonise our island society and economy.#One of these principles is the ‘race without a trace’ concept and we will now work closely with Extreme E, environmental agencies and the community at the race location to ensure only positive impacts for the community and the planet and we will ensure that the legacy benefits of this event spread to other island communities from the Butt to Barra.”Alejandro Agag, Founder and CEO of Extreme E said:“We are thrilled with this investment and to be exploring racing in Scotland in .“It is a fitting location off the back of COP, which will be held in Glasgow imminently, and will allow the conversation on electric mobility and the climate emergency to continue further, inspiring action and highlighting ious solutions and mitigation strategies.“We look forward to continuing to work with the UK Government, the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar and other key stakeholders as we continue discussions for a Scottish event.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/19441874_10155501009258385_6677282795924187201_o.jpg","title":"levelling up cash for shintys bught park in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineNearly £ million, announced in the budget by chancellor Rishi Sunak, will go to developments in the Highland capital.Though the final details are still to be worked out, a new grandstand to replace the existing -year old structure, as well as facilities and a new shinty museum, could form part of the upgradeThe £ million package will go towards three schemes brought together under the umbrella of the Inverness Zero Carbon Cultural Regeneration project.The Northern Meeting Park and the Inverness Castle will also share in the funds, and it is hoped the cash can help attract more major events to the city.Shinty’s governing body, the Camanachd Association, and Inverness Shinty Club were involved in supporting the application, alongside Highland Council, Highle Highland and Highlands  Islands Enterprise.Steven Mackenzie, Camanachd Association president said: “The Camanachd Association look forward to hearing more detail on how this funding will improve facilities at the Bught Park.#I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank all parties involved in this successful funding application but particularly the Camanachd Association directors and staff who have worked closely with Inverness Shinty Club to ensure shinty was an integral part of the funding bid.”Derek Keir, Camanachd Association Chief Executive Officer said: “The news of the levelling up fund is a true testament to the power of working in partnership and we look forward to playing a key role in supporting the next steps as plans for the Bught Park progress.#I would like to pay particular tribute to our team at the Camanachd Associationwho have played a crucial role in these developments so far, to Inverness Shinty Club for their continued work in the community and to our partners at Highle Highland, Highland Council and HIE who all played a crucial role, we are very much excited about the next steps”.John Finlayson, Camanachd Association Director and Highland Councillor said: “I am delighted to hear such positive news for Inverness, the Highlands and the game of shinty and again the success of this bid shows the importance of partnership working between public bodies, sporting organisations and communities.“I am sure everyone across the Highlands and within the game of Shinty nationally, are excited by the prospect of upgraded facilities at the Bught Park which will help sustain and develop our sport in the years ahead.”Drew McNeil, Inverness Shinty Club development director said: “Investment in the development of the stadium is overdue.#It is extremely exciting but it needs to be tempered as the devil is in the detail and that’s not clear yet. We look forward to the future discussions on behalf of Shinty within the city affording Scotland’s first sport a facility befitting the cultural importance of our traditional sport.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3_Catriona-and-Ian-Cameron-11-Fasach_Borrodale-Primary-1950s-c.-1954.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais time and our moving wells of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIt brings to our mind’s eye some of our earliest memories of community connections.My earliest memories of Halloween relate to two dferent social experiences revealing dferent relationships that I will deal with separately.Firstly, particularly vivid are my memories of the Halloween parties we had in Borrodale Primary School.Sometimes these parties would involve a wee ‘house cèilidh’ of performances at the school, with family and friends invited to visit the fun.As the occasion drew near, we would spend time away from regular lessons and prepare for our party by reorganising the classroom: carving out swedes for our lanterns , setting out stalls for spooky games and tricks, and of course for dunking or ‘dooking’ for apples. is a short play, where two girls are on their guising visits and to their surprise find themselves in a witch’s house.Borrodale school was built at some point after the  Education Act , conforming to the same model as those found throughout the country from that time, to ying degrees of similarity and size.There were three of those schools in Glendale, to encompass the ‘tuath’ or ‘munntir Gleann Dail’, with those in Borreraig and Colbost closing long before Borrodale.For a period, these schools were central to our childhood connections and friendships within the communities, many of which had effectively spanned across generations, following in the footsteps of parents, grandparents, even great-grandparents.included.During my own time in Borrodale , and that of my siblings, like generations of family before us, we walked between Borrodale and our home in Fàsach many times.And now, like in the time of our great-grandfather, again the school is no more. I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way. Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

One clinician claims the details of senior Stormont ministers and other public figures were among the tranche of examples viewed and then cited last month to senior Department officials.It is understood that in the past month these specic issues with the software were articulated by medical staff throughout Northern Ireland and also raised directly with chief medical officer Michael McBride, vaccination programme chief Patricia Donnelly, the Public Health Agency, and the developers of the software.The Department of Health would not confirm or deny yesterday that these claims were raised with officials, including Mr McBride or Ms Donnelly.In a statement, a spokesman said: “We will continue to work closely with GPs, Trusts and pharmacies to address any concerns and help ensure best practice.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Controlled access to patient information is “essential to ensure clinical safety and quality data” and to help maximise vaccine uptake. “Vaccination is being provided by dferent health care providers, each of whom must be able to cross-check key details before dispensing vaccines, added the statement.While it is not unusual for healthcare settings to access such details, clinicians are concerned that little has been done to investigate inappropriate access to data by those who are not medically trained.Well-placed sources say the alleged problems first came to light after the VMS was updated to include details on booster and winter vaccinations. As a consequence of this update, the searchwas widened.It is understood there were “serious concerns” expressed on day one of this update by a number of staff members to Department officials.“Why did this happen  Because the system was rushed. The reason clinicians raised this was that it would only be a matter of time before someone would go roguethey hadn’t already. There are too many users,” said one clinician.He claims the potential for a “security risk”personal information was compromised was one of the matters raised specically with senior officials, including concerns around people’s safety.“Our main concern has been the potential for a risk to the safety of people, including Stormont ministers, MLAs, MPs, members of the PSNI, security forces, journalists and anyone who currently has threats against them. It only takes one person who may have an alternative motive or is in a position to pass on this information to be a rogue element.“And as for criminal elements, you don’t need an awful lot more than those key details and that may help facilitate you getting more information to carry out fraud.”Due to the number of vaccines that have been administered and the volume of work needed to input data, a large number of casual and temporary staff members were recruited. But the majority of those accessing the system, said this source “are not clinicians and don’t have the associated professional standards”.“I am not aware of any requirement or indeed any signicant checks on people who are engaged for these roles through Trusts or practices.“The fact the information has not been restrictive means it did not give necessary guarantees that those temporary staff would treat it all confidentially,” he said.One of the most serious claims from the medical professionals who raised the alarm last month was that the new update did not contain an audit trail — meaning searches could have been going on without a trace.“It has been apparent that the software needed an audit trail from the outset, so that anyone using the system could be tracked. But it became clear that there wasn’t. If there is one now, when did it become available ”Asked how he can be sure there wasn’t an audit trail when this was raised weeks ago, he replied: “The Department told doctors.”He added: “Can the Department now tell me who has looked up my details  The answer to that, I believe, is no. They can’t. Any amount of people could have looked up your details, but they can’t tell you who would have logged on and when.”Another clinician has claimed the issues were “flagged up across the board” before the system even went live — including the potential for “outside elements to break into the database” as was the case when the Republic’s HSE system was compromised in a cyber attack earlier this year.“Even on the day that the VMS was launched people were saying: ‘Are you sure about this ’ It was pointed out there needed to be assurances around snooping, and to protect patients’ details and accessing demographics that they shouldn’t have access to.”He claims several medics warned the Department “not to proceed with the project until the problems were ironed out”.“We are told they said they needed to get the data up on to the vaccination dashboard. They said they would look at it and work it out.”A spokesman for the Department of Health rebutted these claims, saying the system is “secure and only accessible by registered users with a full audit trail in place”.However, the Department would not saythis has always been the case, ora problem had to be addressed in recent weeks.In correspondence late yesterday, a senior Department of Health figure warned that given the “hysterical nature of some of the vaccination public debate, any article on anonymous claims with no evidence of actual misuse is still likely to lead to more hysteria and  claims, potentially damaging the vaccination programme”.Most ReadRobin Swann instructs top lawyer Paul Tweed to sue Van Morrison for libel for calling him ‘dangerous’Charlie Chaplin’s granddaughter tells of her family’s NI bigotry nightmareMarried couples charged over alleged cigarette racketThieving postie’s six years of crime exposedDavid Tweed’s daughters reveal the ‘monster’ he really was after years of sexual abuse at hands of late rugby star fatherTop VideosPlayVan Morrison and Ian Paisley in anti-Robin Swann chants at Europa Hotel eventPlayCar with Irish registration plates set alight outside Rangers club on Shankill RoadPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Latest Northern IrelandRathcoole bus set on fire after gang hijackingNI child safety expert claims judiciary failing to deter perpetrators of online sex crimes through leniency of sentencingEU could set aside Brexit trade dealUK suspends NI Protocol, Coveney warnsUK playing ‘very dangerous game’ with Article  threatStarmer urges UK against triggering Article  in Northern Ireland Protocol rowLatestMS worker hails optional pronoun badges as important for ‘allyship’Kim Little scores twice as Arsenal maintain winning start against West HamRathcoole bus set on fire after gang hijackingSolskjaer setback, sackings and slip-ups –  Premier League talking pointsKyle Coetzer ‘extremely proud’ of Scotland’s achievements at T World Cup,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I cannot condem strongly enough this incident  blantant destruction of property. I hope the driver and passengers were unharmed. Any information, please contact @PoliceServiceNI.— John Blair MLANovember , TUV North Belfast Assembly candidate Ron McDowell condemned the attack “in the strongest possible terms” and said he appreciates “that tensions are high in our community but whatever the motivation was for the trouble currently ongoing in Rathcoole this achieves nothing for the area.”“This is not Rathcoole and should not be representative of the people there. I condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms,” he continued.“Rathcoole is a great place filled with great people who will rightly be outraged at this.“It is incumbent on elected representatives of unionism to provide leadership. Sadly that has been lacking and I fear that people are exploring that. When unionists set deadlines and make threats about political action they need to follow through.

Good accountability means measuring what matters. Excessive weighing and measuring is the direct result of a system responding to narrow performance targets.“Add school funding pressures to narrow performance targets and we get a toxic mix. A mix that leads directly to gaming the system, screening out pupils from taking exams lest they “pollute the stats”, practices such as “off-rolling”, pupils being dumpedat GCSE or AS level, exam-switching and exam-board promiscuity , teaching to the test and spoon-fed education,” the union continued.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “These are all inevitable,unintended, consequences of high-stakes, narrow, system performance targets as well as features of low-trust, unprofessional environments.“Our children are tested, monitored, tracked, and evaluated to exhaustion. This “hamster-wheel” education narrows the curriculum to “ducking the stats” to the detriment of a broad-based education.“It prevents the development of the sort of st century skills required to cope and thrive in the modern world.“Our obsession with exams squeezes time, leaving little space for the st century skills required for successful careers, productive work and enjoyable lives. Children lose out.”The union is also urging the review  to consider the perceived bias in favour of grammar school and university education in society.“There is a widespread perception of bias, or snobbery, towards “academic” learning over practical or applied learning,” the union said.“The bias in favour of a university education compounds this.“Policy decisions continue to entrench the ‘grammar school-University route’ whilst Further EducationColleges continues to meet wide, and growing demands. Colleges continue to face a reputational deficit compared to Universities.“Iniduals and businesses who engage with FE services rate Colleges very highly but despite this, most Northern Ireland parents’ ambitions for their children focus on the grammar school and university route. Many employers still seek their supply of labour from this pool.”The Union also said action needs to be taken to shed Northern Ireland from the tag of the most segregated education system in the developed world.“The OECD’s benchmark placed us at th out of  developed countries on that measure,” it said.“We cannot afford this, financially or societally.”Among the other key points raised by the union, considering the financial strain being faced across education it suggests a front-loading of finance in favour of the early years sector.To replace GCSE exams, which the union said are ”largely pointless as children do not leave education at  anymore,” it suggests the successful Republic of Ireland Transition Year between the Junior and Senior Certicate cyclesas an alternative.Related topicsDepartment of EducationMore On Department of Education PremiumParents to continue drive for unorm equality​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ despite cancelled meeting PremiumViewpointOpinionICT plan can boost technology sectorAlliance MLA Chris Lyttle to step down PremiumMark BainOpinionBudget : Focus should be on necessities, not on embellishments that can wait for another dayParent group calls for independent review of school unorm arrangements in NI amid cost concernsMost ReadCharlie Chaplin’s granddaughter tells of her family’s NI bigotry nightmareRobin Swann instructs top lawyer Paul Tweed to sue Van Morrison for libel for calling him ‘dangerous’David Tweed’s daughters reveal the ‘monster’ he really was after years of sexual abuse at hands of late rugby star fatherMarried couples charged over alleged cigarette racketThieving postie’s six years of crime exposedTop VideosPlayVan Morrison and Ian Paisley in anti-Robin Swann chants at Europa Hotel eventPlayCar with Irish registration plates set alight outside Rangers club on Shankill RoadPlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Latest Northern IrelandBus hijacked and set on fire near loyalist estateParents to continue drive for unorm equality​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ despite cancelled meetingRathcoole bus set on fire after gang hijackingNI child safety expert claims judiciary failing to deter perpetrators of online sex crimes through leniency of sentencingEU could set aside Brexit trade dealUK suspends NI Protocol, Coveney warnsLatestBus hijacked and set on fire near loyalist estateParents to continue drive for unorm equality​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ despite cancelled meetingMS worker hails optional pronoun badges as important for ‘allyship’Kim Little scores twice as Arsenal maintain winning start against West HamRathcoole bus set on fire after gang hijacking,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy. “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

The Minister has released funds to provide additional support for housing associationsReporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Foyle Sinn Feacutein MLA Ciara Ferguson has urged all parties to get behind the Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey’s plans to transform housing in the North. Ms Hargey has approved an extra poundmillion towards additional support for housing associations. This comes on top of the increased new build budget of poundmillion. The Minister that the new build programme, along with the additional funds, was there to address the issue of housing stress both in the present-day and beyond. googletag.cmd.push Ms Ferguson backed the Minister saying that everyone had the right to a decent home and urged other parties to give their support to ensure that aim can fulfilled. She said: “Sinn Feacutein Minister Deirdre Hargey is taking forward the biggest transformation in public housing in  years, getting the Housing Executive back to building social and affordable homes. “Everyone should have the right to a decent home, and I commend the minister for her leadership in taking on the issues of affordability, building more homes and equal access to housing which need to be addressed. “Finance Minister Conor Murphy also recently announced the largest house building budget in over a decade and work has started on over , new homes in the last year, surpassing the target by  percent. “She is also taking forward legislative change through her Private Tenancies Bill, to protect renters, while proposals for rent controls and rent freezes are also under consideration. “Minister Hargey has also increased support for Co-Ownership and is consulting on alternative avenues to home ownership which are genuinely accessible and affordable to workers and families. “The Minister has demonstrated a remarkable determination to grasp this issue, but such is the scale of the challenge, that this cannot be left to one minister alone – we need people and organisations working together. “Equality in housing cannot wait. The need for more social and affordable homes, particularly in places like the north west, cannot be ignored and I would hope that all parties could get behind this ambitious plan to deliver real and tangible change for current and future generations.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Governments from across the world are currently attending the conference on climate change in Glasgow with the aim of seeing what can be done to halt global warming. googletag.cmd.push Activists from all over are making sure their political leaders are being held to account and Derry is no dferent with the North West Climate Coalition making their voices heard prior to Saturdays Global Day of Action march in the city. People Before Profit Counicllor, Maeve ONeill – who is also a member of the North West Climate Coalition – said: “Previous Climate Conferences of world leaders has gotten us no where near to taking proper action on the climate crisis. “It is nothing more than a greenwashing opportunity for those in power. “Real change will come from the organising and mass mobilisation of millions of people across this world. “This is people power and its the most effective tool we have in making the transformative change we need.” Ms ONeills fellow People Before Profit Councillor, Shaun Harkin, said that while the parties in the Stormont Executive have been saying all the right things about climate change, their talk has yet to be matched by positive action. He added: “Over the past week, every local mainstream party has paraded its commitment to the environment. “They have all sent representatives to Glasgow to give interviews in an effort to associate themselves with calls for drastic action to save the world. They were just as unanimous back in  in voting at the Assembly for a public inquiry into how more than a million tonnes of toxic waste was dumped on Derry’s doorstep. “But there’s been no public inquiry. The toxic waste still festers there, with nobody held responsible. “Now that the environment is top of the news agenda, they are all out presenting their counterfeit credentials as fighters against the creation of waste and pollution of the land. “The only thing the establishment parties are serious about recycling is empty rhetoric.” The Global Day of Action takes place on Saturday, November  at pm in Waterloo Place, Derry.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Eighty-eight-year-old Jims career as a postmaster has gone from strength to strength. Jim first took on Carlisle Road Post Office in  after a friend of his announced his retirement and askedhe was interested in taking over. googletag.cmd.push After re-organising the post office and discovering how much he enjoyed the work, he then took on Park Avenue Post Office after its Postmaster also retired. After a third local postmaster retired – this time on Buncrana Road – Jim decided to once again take on a branch because he liked it so much. His service has spanned some of the most turbulent periods Northern Ireland has faced. Serving these communities during the height of the Troubles, Jim said he became the most robbed postmaster in the UK but he continued running his branches through a combination of “stubbornness and great staff”. Besides supporting the community through the Troubles, Jim’s branches were also a leline through the Covid- pandemic. Although the initial impact of the pandemic saw footfall sharply fall, Jim said that with the right precautions in place his customers gradually ed. Jim has lived in Derry his entire le and at the age of  has decided that it is now time “to hang up the date stamp”. Reflecting on the evolution of Post Office, Jim remarked how it has “changed drastically over the years” with the “introduction of computers, online business, emails”. In particular, he noted that post offices increasingly now act on behalf on many banks in supporting customers to withdraw and deposit their cash. Above all, Jim reflected on the people he has both worked alongside and served. He gave credit to those he worked with over his four decades of services, noting “I was lucky to have first class people about me. Without them I would not have remained”. He also admitted that, at one point, he may have known as many as half the people in Derry because he ran three dferent branches and enjoyed talking to people from the local communities so much. His branches in particular served and supported many elderly people and pensioners. The excellent service his work partners provided led to an increase in the number of elderly customers because “we all went beyond the call of duty to give a good service” – and this was particularly true during the pandemic. Local Post Office Area Manager, Sean Docherty, has his own personal connection to both Jim and the post office. Mr Docherty said: “The Branch has a history for me also as I started my career at the age of  in the branch over  years ago and its very near my family home, so it has a real special meaning to me. “Jim and his daughter Geraldine are widely known and very well respected within the city for their tireless dedication, commitment and service to their local community all throughout the Troubles and beyond. I wish Jim all the very best and well deserved retirement and long health for the future.” A framed long service leavers’ commemoration letter from Post Office Chief Executive Nick Read was presented by Post Office Network Provision Lead Janese Sung along to Jim with gt vouchers and a pen to thank him for his loyal service. A bouquet of flowers was also presented to his daughter Geraldine. Jim’s daughter, Geraldine, took over in the day-to-day running of Buncrana Road Post Office some  years ago. Buncrana Road Post Office has shared its space with Centra, one of Northern Ireland’s leading convenience stores, for the last  years and Jim has now passed the baton to Centra to continue running the post office.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Lyra, a film celebrating her le will be premiered at both the Belfast and Cork Film FestivalsReporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, “She loved Derry,” says film-maker Alison Millar on her friend Lyra McKee. “She was so happy there. She had met loads of new friends.” Journalist Lyra McKee had spent the last few months of her young le in Derry before she was shot dead on the night of April ,  while reporting on a riot that had broken out on Fanad Drive in the citys Creggan area. googletag.cmd.push She had moved to Derry from Belfast to live with her partner Sarah Canning, a nurse at Altnagelvin Hospital, and thrived during her time here. Millar added: “Derrys a really creative city so she would be meeting up with other writers, journalists and she enjoyed it. “She really loved it and really took to the city. Belfast was her home but she really settled into Derry. Lyra hadnt been there very long but she loved living in Derry.” Millars film on her friend, simply titled “Lyra”, will be premiered on Sunday evening simultaneously at the Belfast and Cork Film Festivals respectively. This will be the latest in a long line of acclaimed work for Millar who herself has had IFTA, BAFTA and Prix Italia success for her documentaries. Although not yet planned for general release throughout cinemas in Ireland or even broadcast on television, Millar is hopeful that over the next year or so, many others will get to see the film. The film itself opens to window to people who only knew Lyra McKee by her written work or even by the news of her killing two years ago. Rumours aplenty had begun to generate of others planning to make a film about Lyra and Millar knew that being a close friend of McKees, she had to be the one to do it. After all, as Millar says, had anything happened to her, Lyra would be writing about Alison. Millar said: “I knew she loved my films and wrote about them. I knew that she wrote about me in her books. So I came to the conclusion thatanybody  made a film about her, I would be really fed up about it. “Because I knew her family and her partner Sarah and I knew they wanted me to make a film with their help – and they helped me hugely. “I had a team of people who all knew her as well. I knew thatanything had happened to us, Lyra would be writing about us so we just knew we had to do it. It wasnt even like will we or will we not, we had to it because we wanted people to know more about her and her work. “The film was more like a way of trying to get people to know Lyra more. She had already at such a young age just achieved so much and her work was so astonishing that it could not be not talked about. We wanted to give her that voice and thats what we wanted to achieve. “We also wanted to let people know what Lyra was like as a person. She would have given – in fact Ive seen her do this – someone her last five pounds. She had even given people her coatshe saw somebody cold. “She was one of those people who would meet somebody  and talk to them for ages, askingthey were OK,they needed food orthey were cold, where are they staying are they alright. Lyra was literally that person who wouldnt pass people by. “One example of her work was a story she covered about a guy who set himself on fire at Belfasts City Hall. That was a story that she what had happened but wondered why he did that so she set out to try and find out what could have led someone to that horrible place where they felt they had to do that. “She really was that voice for the under-represented and she wanted to make sure that people were treated better and listened to what they had to say. That compassion and real love of people and le was Lyra – and people loved her back. She was very disarming with that great laugh and smile. It was her charm that got her the big interviews. “When she was , she went on a big trip to Canada to attend a conference andAlicia Keys was one of the speakers. The only person or journalist to get an interview with Alicia Keys at that conference was Lyra McKee. “She decided she wanted to speak to Alicia Keys so she made it through the crowds and the barriers and just said to her, my names Lyra McKee and Id love to interview you. And Alicia replied, Of course – no problem.” Miller and McKee had been friends since they first met when Lyra was . What impressed her about McKee was her compassion and ability to relate to people who were cast aside by society and make sure that the voice of the under-represented would be heard loud and clear. She added: “I first met Lyra when she was . Id known her a long time and I was actually due to have dinner with her the next night at my house whenever I got the message that she had been killed. “I had watched both her and her career grow and she was literally flying. She was amazing – she had just signed a two-book deal with Faber, done the TED talks the year before and she was at the top of her game. Everything was there, sitting waiting for her. She had achieved so much. “She was very compassionate. One of those people who cared deeply about people and giving them a voice. She loved to represent the under-represented. “She came from a wee house in north Belfast, brought up by her mum, her sister and her family. When Lyra was a young girl, she had hearing dficulties that made her speech dficult so she started reading books. Her granny used to buy her Harry Potter books, her sister would buy her The Twits by Roald Dahl and she got submerged in books and writing. “She was writing from an early age as it was her space – her happy place. She actually wrote a lot of poetry when she was a young girl. She wanted to be a poet for a while. “Lyra had just won the Sky Young Journalist of the Year award when I met her. She was  but when I met her I thought she was  as she had this wee baby face that meant she never looked her age. “It used to really annoy her that we would go out for a drink – even when she was in her twenties – and she was always asked to produce ID at the door. “I loved her writing – it was really beautul and descriptive and she looked for voices in her community and to break stories for people she felt hadnt been listened to or heard properly. “From a young age,she saw something and she wanted to do it she did. She always said that brick walls were not there to keep you out. But depending on how much you want something, youve got to work out how to get over them. “We want Lyra’s work to live on, we want her writing to live on, we want her voice to live on. She’s a great character, and what we really want is for people to come and spend some time with her through this film.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

Triumph Hurdle winner Quilixios faces five rivals including fellow Cheltenham winner Jeff Kidder as jump racing s to Naas for the first time this season. Rachael Blackmore will be aboard the Henry de Bromhead-trained Quilixios as the Cheltenham hero makes his seasonal debut in a race that was won by subsequent Champion Hurdle winner Espoir D’Allen in . googletag.cmd.push After a summer campaign on the Flat, Ballymore Champion Four Year Old Hurdle winner, Jeff Kidder will make hisover hurdles against a field that includes Gowran Park maiden winner An Epic Song and Gordon Elliott’s Grade  winner Teahupoo. Elliott is looking to win the Grade  BetVictor Fishery Lane Hurdle for a third successive year following the victories of Call Me Lyreen and Surin and is hopeful his son of Masked Marvel canto winning ways on his seasonal bow. “Teahupoo showed a good level of form last season which was very pleasing,” Elliott said this morning. “He is a horse that always looked like he would progress with a summer behind him. This Saturday looks a hot race but we are looking forward to getting him started.” Elliott also has a strong hand in the Grade  Poplar Square Chase with Felix Desjy the highest rated of the six runner field and he is joined by stable companion Andy Dufresne. Captain Guinness and Darver Star who were placed in the Arkle and Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham respectively add plenty of depth to the field. Elliott reported: “Both horses showed some quality form last season and they both line up with decent chances. Felix Desjy won a Grade  at Punchestown this time last year which is good form and Andy Dufresne ran a solid race in a Grade  and is a solid horse on his day.” Punters can look forward to a competitive renewal of the BetVictor Brown Lad Handicap Hurdle with  runners declared including the Michael Bowe-trained Sweet Sting who would be a fitting winner after the loss of Solernia this week.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Finn Harps  Derry City   There was huge drama at Finn Park as Jamie McGonigle’s late penalty saved Derry City from defeat in a dramatic finale in the Northwest derby. It looked asthe Candystripes were headed to defeat when Ethan Boyle headed Harps into the lead with just  minutes remaining, but McGonigle kept his nerve when presented with a penalty just  minutes later. googletag.cmd.push The point does not help either side, with Harps still in relegation trouble, while City have just won one game in their last six. The first hour gave no hint of the late drama to come. It was all Harps in the early stages, and Babatunde Owolabi could have opened the scoring within two minutes as he shrugged off Cameron McJannet before bearing down on goal and shooting high into the side netting. Harps were only encouraged by that and minutes later Nathan Gartside had to be alert to push away a volley from Ethan Boyle, who tried his luck from  yards as the Derry defence stood off. It took Derry City  minutes to have a shot of any sort at Mark McGinley in the Harps goal, but Ciaron Harkin’s effort from  yards rolled harmlessly wide without bothering the Harps goalkeeper. There was simply nothing between the sides as the game went on but Derry City should have nicked it on  minutes. Harps lost possession in midfield and James Akintunde flicked the ball over the defence to put substitute Jamie McGonigle in on goal. The striker was one on one with Mark McGinley but lobbed it over the goalkeeper and the open goal and the chance was gone. That proved to be costly for Derry as Harps went down the other end and scored within  seconds. Ryan Connolly delivered a free kick into the heart of the City penalty area and it was met by Ethan Boyle who powered a header past Gartside into the net. Harps’ jubilation was cut abruptly short within a minute however as Boyle went from hero to villain as he was adjudged to have handled Jamie McGonigle’s cross and referee Ben Connolly pointed to the penalty spot. It was McGonigle who stepped up and he sent McGonigle the wrong way to score a vital equaliser for Derry City.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Greenlough vs. Steelstown Brian Og’s Ballymaguigan, pm Referee – Gregory McWilliams  , ,  and now  – No one knows just what a Steelstown victory would mean today more than Marty Dunne. The veteran goalkeeper has been there through it all over the years, the joy and excitement of reaching Intermediate finals paling in comparison to the pain of losing them, and often in such cruel circumstances. googletag.cmd.push Dunne could only watch on as Paddy Henry’s effort  seconds from the end, won the game for Castledawson at Celtic Park in . He had to wait another six years for a second chance, only for Castledawson to defeat them by a single point again, this time at Owenbeg. Whilst not as dramatic as Henry’s winner, the loss of a last minute Steelstown free kick, due to Mickey McKinney lashing out at Niall Keenan, saw the opportunity for a replay lost, and Steelstown bodies crashed to the ground in dismay at the final whistle. Four years later and it seemed it might finally be Steelstown’s year – they held a good lead against Greenlough at Bellaghy, but they let it slip, and an error by Dunne himself led to a goal for Michael McDonnell in added time. There was no way back. So, in , Steelstown still await their first title, and Dunne, still going strong at , has one more chance to get his hands on a trophy that has eluded his grasp for over a decade. This will be his fth final - fourth Intermediate, one junior - and he knows just how fortunate he is to get another opportunity. “Its one thing you understand when you get older you appreciate them more and you look forward to them,” he said. “You know they are not going to come around all the time. When you’re younger you think ‘we’ll get plenty of these’, but you realise how sparse they are now so it’s good to be in it again and get another chance at it. “We would have killed to be back in this position after last year. A lot of teams could just fade away after something like that and not get back up there again, so we’re lucky in that regard in that we’re straight back where we want to be and we can have another rattle at them.” Last year’s final is still fresh in his mind, and it is he who brings up his short kick-out which led to that late McMullan goal. That is a regret, but he doesn’t lose sleep over it. “These things happen in matches,” he acknowledged. “All you can do is try and put it right again. Once it’s done it’s done. You are a goalkeeper and you’re going to make these mistakes, so these things are going to happen, especially in the heat of a final when you’re trying to rush things and trying to do things. It will not be in my head anyway, that’s for sure. “We were up by three points I think going into the final quarter and we never really kicked on. We kind of sat back and we never pushed on to get that result. You always think you should have won it and my contribution at the end didn’t help. These things happen so I’m looking forward to getting a second chance at it.”  Weight of history Everyone knows by now that Steelstown are still without that elusive first title, but Dunne, who has every right to feel that the club deserves one by now, does not believe that the weight of history should be a factor this weekend. “The first one is always the hardest to get over the line, but it’s a dferent group of players,” he explained. “I don’t think the young boys will be too concerned about that, it’s still just one match against Greenlough who are a good side and it will be hard to win. You would like to experience getting over finals, but the only way you can do that is by winning your first one.” It is impossible not to notice the progress made at Steelstown over recent years- from their senior ladies, to their reserves, to their underage work – the club is synonymous with success in so many ways. Dunne has enjoyed being a part of that, but he knows from the grassroots up to senior, nothing can ever be taken for granted “There’s been ups and downs but you always think it’s going to be a straight line up,” he reflected. “Going into senior was brilliant even though we didn’t win Intermediate, we stepped into senior and that was good, getting a run at senior. I wish we had stayed there, it’s disappointing to be back down in Intermediate, because we could have stayed on there. “This group of players are good enough for senior and that’s where they need to be. In the long term that’s what those guys need. “You always want the trajectory heading up the ways and that’s the next step but you want to win a championship. That’s the point. If we were to get that it would definitely help that group of players push on. It seems that every time Steelstown are in a final it’s a young team, but we probably have a better balance than we ever had there’s plenty of older heads there and younger boys spread throughout the team.” Hugh McGrath’s team were very impressive in Sunday’s semi-final win over the Limavady Wolfhounds. The -, - victory was borne from slick and clinical attacking play and the game was over as a contest by the half time break. Steelstown are going into the final with great momentum. “We made a good start, pegging on the scores and keeping the pressure on,” Dunne agrees. “There was a wide range of scorers so we weren’t relying on one or two scorers. It was good to get it over the line with a decent performance, but obviously Greenlough is going to be a step up again, we’re under no illusions about that. Our heads are pretty level one thing about this group is that they won’t get ahead of themselves in any regard. “We have to go at them and take them on, and get the scores on the board and be confident. We did that in the final against them last year but then we dried up and didn’t really push on, and we sat back a bit which isn’t really our style. You can’t throw away -point leads or -pount leads, you just can’t do it because you can’t stop momentum thenit turns against you. You have to keep pushing on.”  The future Dunne had decided to retire two years ago, but he was convinced by Eamon Gibson tolast year, and as  comes to an end he is still the main man for Steelstown. He knows by now not to look too far ahead, but he would dearly love to get that trophy in his hands before that final game comes. What a fairytale ending that would be for a terric club servant. “I’ll not look beyond Saturday’s match and see how it pans out from there,” he said. “Things could be very dferent depending on the dferent outcomes, so I haven’t given too much thought to it. “That’s why you keep going, because you want to win something. There’s plenty of people out there who don’t even get the chance to get to a final, plenty of players who have played for a lot longer than me and haven’t had much to show for it. As much as you can look back and say it’s disappointing not to win, at least you have got this one more chance, and that’s all you can ever have, that one chance every year, so take it, and I’m just looking forward to that.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Institute  Dergview  It was another opportunity missed for Institute as they could only draw with Dergview at the Brandywell. It is now seven games without a win for ‘Stute who overcame a half time deficit, but despite some good chances, could not turn the game in their favour. A ‘Stute mistake gave Derview the lead early on. Goalkeeper John Connolly yelled for his defender to leave it as Cathal Farren’s cross came in, but he dropped the ball straight into the path of the league’s top scorer Benny Igiehon, wo simply put the ball into the empty net to make it -. googletag.cmd.push It should have gotten worse for the home side on the half hour when Niall McGinley broke down the left, and he picked out Farren in the middle, but the former Derry City striker scuffed his effort wide of the target with just Connolly to beat. The home side were thrown a leline just before the hour mark when they were awarded a penalty. A cross into the Dergview box found Aaron McGurk, whose touch took the ball away from him. Both McLaughlin and goalkeeper Buchanan went for the loose ball and it looked asthe goalkeeper got there first, but not according to referee Harrigan, who pointed to the spot. Dergview were baffled by the decision, but after their protests, McLaughlin kept his calm to score his first goal in  games and his th for the season overall to make it -. ‘Stute had a great chance to take the lead in the game for the first time on  minutes when McGurk did well to work his way into the area, and although his shot was blocked, the ball fell out of the sky right onto the foot of McLaughlin, who volleyed wide with the whole goal to aim at. Those missed chances almost cost ‘Stute as Dergview began to get on top for the first time in the second half as the game entered the final ten minutes. Jamie Browne had his head in his hands after he dispossessed Jamie Dunne just outside his own area, but the striker was denied at the last second by the ‘Stute man, who made amends by deflecting the shot behind for a corner. From that set-piece, ‘Stute were lucky to survive as the ball bounced around the area, and it took a few brave blocks to keep the ball from reaching Connolly’s goal with Dergview players lining up to put it in.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Michael McMullan Nov Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Relief. That was Hugh McGrath’s take on finally getting over the line as Steelstown won their first Intermediate title at last.He admitted it wasn’t this side’s best showing of the season. Nor were they cohesive. And they didn’t play the brand of football they wanted. But there was only one currency Steelstown were dealing in. Silverware. That’s all Saturday was about.“It just matters that you are ahead at the end of the game,” said McGrath.“I wasn’t nervous in any way,” he told his side before the club’s historic hour. “I was jealous that they got to get the chance to go out and show what they were worth and show what was inside them.”And, coming back from last season’s defeat and in the manner which they did, that – in McGrath’s opinion – is the Steelstown’s calling card.“It tells you all you need to know about the group,” he said.The burden of three final defeats didn’t come into the narrative. It was a new management team, with a sprinkling of new players.At dferent times this year, McGrath beat the drum of a new beginning. Donncha Gilmore is now an All-Ireland winner. Five championships goals later, Morgan Murray has arrived on the scene and like Oran Fox, he benefitted from a league campaign that McGrath treated as gloried friendlies.It wasn’t about hard luck stories or flashbacks from yesteryear.“All we could base any chat around was what we done this year so far,” McGrath again stressed.“We were confident that we’d get ourselves in enough positions to take chances, that we’d create enough chances to get ourselves over the line.“We knew it would be tough, you don’t play the champions and get it easy. We knew it would be tough all the way through and it was about grinding it out.”Points from Jason McAleer and Eoghan Bradleyhad Steelstown three points clear after eight minutes, but the sides were levelat the break.“We weren’t panicking because we knew these things happen,” insisted the Steelstown boss. We went a couple down at the start of the second half. Maybe there was a bit of panic and you are going to feel that pressure when you have a couple of forwards like Greenlough have.”But McGrath trusted their leaders. Skipper Forester. Impact man Mickey McKinney. Midfielder Ryan Devine. All players from the  minor team he coached when he arrived at the club.“You have confidence that you have a group that will drive you on and get you over the line and that’s the way it panned out,” McGrath said.The fact they were still at the coal face of their title bid spoke volumes. McKinney was crying with total elation. “Is this real ”, bellowed Forester amid the pandemonium.“To go so long until now, it shows the type of characters that they are. They hung in there and had the belief in the group that was coming behind them,” McGrath added.“They are emotional. It shows how much the clubs means to them they have a desire to win.”And on the weekend that marked the thanniversary of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s death. The club now carries his name.For McGrath, the final quarter told the story of the McKeever family.“That’s the way he would’ve played his game. If you look at the way Neildrove out, Eoghan Concannon hammered everything that was near him.“That was Brian Oacuteg McKeever, that’s what he did and there are plenty around here that know that’s what he did.“They were part of him, they saw him do it and the young people coming through are now aware of it too.”“He is never too far from our thoughts and Charleneas well, she played exactly the same way. For us to be able to do this for the McKeever family and give them something to celebrate, we are proud do to that.” googletag.cmd.push ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

That was Hugh McGrath’s take on finally getting over the line as Steelstown won their first Intermediate title at last.He admitted it wasn’t this side’s best showing of the season. Nor were they cohesive. And they didn’t play the brand of football they wanted. But there was only one currency Steelstown were dealing in. Silverware. That’s all Saturday was about.“It just matters that you are ahead at the end of the game,” said McGrath.“I wasn’t nervous in any way,” he told his side before the club’s historic hour. “I was jealous that they got to get the chance to go out and show what they were worth and show what was inside them.”And, coming back from last season’s defeat and in the manner which they did, that – in McGrath’s opinion – is the Steelstown’s calling card.“It tells you all you need to know about the group,” he said.The burden of three final defeats didn’t come into the narrative. It was a new management team, with a sprinkling of new players.At dferent times this year, McGrath beat the drum of a new beginning. Donncha Gilmore is now an All-Ireland winner. Five championships goals later, Morgan Murray has arrived on the scene and like Oran Fox, he benefitted from a league campaign that McGrath treated as gloried friendlies.It wasn’t about hard luck stories or flashbacks from yesteryear.“All we could base any chat around was what we done this year so far,” McGrath again stressed.“We were confident that we’d get ourselves in enough positions to take chances, that we’d create enough chances to get ourselves over the line.“We knew it would be tough, you don’t play the champions and get it easy. We knew it would be tough all the way through and it was about grinding it out.”Points from Jason McAleer and Eoghan Bradleyhad Steelstown three points clear after eight minutes, but the sides were levelat the break.“We weren’t panicking because we knew these things happen,” insisted the Steelstown boss. We went a couple down at the start of the second half. Maybe there was a bit of panic and you are going to feel that pressure when you have a couple of forwards like Greenlough have.”But McGrath trusted their leaders. Skipper Forester. Impact man Mickey McKinney. Midfielder Ryan Devine. All players from the  minor team he coached when he arrived at the club.“You have confidence that you have a group that will drive you on and get you over the line and that’s the way it panned out,” McGrath said.The fact they were still at the coal face of their title bid spoke volumes. McKinney was crying with total elation. “Is this real ”, bellowed Forester amid the pandemonium.“To go so long until now, it shows the type of characters that they are. They hung in there and had the belief in the group that was coming behind them,” McGrath added.“They are emotional. It shows how much the clubs means to them they have a desire to win.”And on the weekend that marked the thanniversary of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s death. The club now carries his name.For McGrath, the final quarter told the story of the McKeever family.“That’s the way he would’ve played his game. If you look at the way Neildrove out, Eoghan Concannon hammered everything that was near him.“That was Brian Oacuteg McKeever, that’s what he did and there are plenty around here that know that’s what he did.“They were part of him, they saw him do it and the young people coming through are now aware of it too.”“He is never too far from our thoughts and Charleneas well, she played exactly the same way. For us to be able to do this for the McKeever family and give them something to celebrate, we are proud do to that.” googletag.cmd.push ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Celebrations as Steelstown clinch historic first championship title overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Emma McGinley: I am appealing to the whole community to be vigilant and watch out for each other, especially elderly neighbours who are particularly vulnerableLocal NewsCreggan residents urged to stay safe after reports of attempted break-ins overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Steelstown players celebrate their Intermediate title success over Greenlough.

I was going to talk about the NI Music Prize when the predictable happens and rant on deaf ears about the unfairness of it all, but I continually vote in it, and it has been quite spot-on in the past, so, maybe I might wise up. Probably not like. Anyway. googletag.cmd.push For those not familiar and familiar with the process Aaron Cunningham, deputy editor at Chordblossom Addison Paterson, Alastair Simpson, Andrew Lemon, The Thin Air Brendan McKeown, Mr Brian Coney, editor at The Thin Air, Chris Corrigan, head of music Queens University Belfast, Carolyn Mathers, Director of Snow Water middot Christopher McBride, Ciara McMullan, photographer Erika Clarke, Chris Flack, Colin Harper, Colum Fitzsimons, David Roy, Dan Hegarty, Davy Sims, Rachael Campbell Palmer, director Black Box, Dolores Vischer, Monk, Edwin McFee, journalist Gerry Sheppard, Hannah Anderson, Hannah Gibson, Mark Hornby, James Ayo, Robert Brown, Editor at Chordblossom middot John DArcy, Jamie Taylor, beautul Everton fan, Janis Leaden, Amy Nolan, Jimmy Devlin, Joe Dougan, Johanna Leech, Jonathan Stewart, Josh Henry, Jo Wright, Kate Barry, Keely, Keith Millar, Me, Les Hume, Lisa Flavelle, Dylan Murphy and Jack Rapanakis, Mari Jackson, Mark Millar, Brendan McGoran, Meghan Gilleece, Thee Micky Ferry, Thee Nance Hall, Nattassa Latcham, Niall Byrne, Olga Kaye, Patricia McConville, Paddy Craig, Music Peter Cinnamond, Phil McCarroll, Ralph McClean, Roisin McNickle, Rory McConnell, Ruth McCarthy, Sara Champ, Sarah Kiely, Sean Kelly, Sean McCann, Simon Oliver, Siobhan McAndrew, Stephen McCaulay of the wonderful taste, handsome Stevie Lennox, Steve Stockman, Stuart Fletcher, Stuart Bailie obviously, Geoff Topley, Thomas Camblin and Saul Duffin have decided that Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic, Arvo Party’s Inheritance, Bicep’s Isles, CATALAN!’s Veritas, Danni Larkin’s Notes For A Maiden Warrior, Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave, Jealous Of The Birds’ Peninsula, Joshua Burnside’s Into The Depths Of Hell, New Pagans’s The Seed The Vessel The Roots And All, Peter J McCauley’s Amnesty, Saint Sister’s Where I Should End, This Ship Argo’s Always The Bees Never The Honey, TRUacute’s No Fixed Abode and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won have all been nominated for the best album at the Northern Ireland Music Prize and Amy Montgomery’sIntangible, Bicep’smiddot Apricots, Cherym’sListening To My Head, Dea Matrona’sStamp On It, Enola Gay’sSofa Surfing, Invaderband’sI Wont Remember You, Jordan Adetunji’s Wokeup! and Waldorf  Cannon’sWe Are Your Governmenthave been nominated for best single at event. There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here.

I was going to talk about the NI Music Prize when the predictable happens and rant on deaf ears about the unfairness of it all, but I continually vote in it, and it has been quite spot-on in the past, so, maybe I might wise up. Probably not like.

There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently.

St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other.

Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created.

Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him.

Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul.

Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships.

Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay.

The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job.

Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work.

The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way.

Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

We wanted to celebrate that and also remember our dear friend and past pupil, Sonia Kinsella, who died of cancer last year.ldquoWhen we think of her strength and her courage and more importantly, her optimism, this play seemed so appropriate. We hope it pays tribute to Sonia as I think the sentiments this play evokes were embodied in that remarkable lady.ldquoThe play celebrates the strength of female friendship and the incredible support women experience from each other. I think our audiences will find themselves laughing one minute and crying the next.I am so proud of what has been achieved not only in the fact we havenrsquot fallen out despite the dficulties you face when you are trying to work with friends but also the time these busy women have devoted to learning lines and rehearsing while working full time and coping with family responsibilities. It has been hard work but I truly feel audiences will really enjoy the performance.Proceeds from the performances will be in aid of Marie Curie and Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos sister schools in South Africa.Marcelle said: ldquoThese schools struggle financially anyway but they are experiencing great challenges during lockdown. The money we raise will make a huge dference to many lives there, allowing girls to get access to education and to be offered a meal each day.The provision offered to these students in South Africa can make all the dference to their future.She added: It is wonderful to see the fruition of all our hard work that all stemmed from a conversation during lockdown and that will hopefully benefit others in dferent ways.To purchase a ticket the production, please contact the school reception on   . Tickets are pound each with all proceeds being ided between the two charities.

The website is now live. It is www.redkiteretreat and we are regularly updating our Facebook page @redkiteretreat. For more information please pay us a visit on Facebook, like and share the page.Red Kites were in the area and over a year ago and Stephen started feeding them and as this continued more and more started turning up daily.Red Kites are a bird of prey and have a huge wingspan of up to . metres they are reddish brown with black wingtips and a grey head.They have a distinctive V-shaped tail which they use like a rudder as they twist and turn through the air on thermals and their call is a long whistle.Red Kites are primarily scavengers and a big part of their diet is made up of dead animals , including road-kill. They also follow tractors when ploughing and swoop down to grab any small animals that have been killed by the mowers or brought to the surface.They are no threat to livestock and the largest animal they have the power and speed to kill is a young rabbit. Red Kites, like all other birds of prey, are protected by law and to harm, disturb or kill them is a criminal offence.The new Red Kite Retreat bird hide has already become very popular with wildle photographers and bird watchers and booking a slot is essential.Three generations of the Malcomson family have also helped to plant some of the first of , native trees on a -acre site to create The Warriorrsquos Wood on Dechomet Mountain.The main contractor, Scottish Woodland Ireland Ltd, managed the forest expansion and farm ersication project and planted Irish Oak, Hazel, Holly, Scots Pine and Downy Birch. Stephen and Karen also created two new ponds to encourage wildle and sowed a new wildflower meadow.Warriorrsquos Wood is the initial habitat enhancement works which form part of the new eco-tourism development known as the lsquoRed Kite Retreatrsquo.Stephen and Karen are the projectrsquos co-founders and wanted a means of ersying their farm business to ensure future sustainability.Currently, Stephen has a pig and beef unit on the farm but said ldquofarming enterprises have to adapt and evolve to ensure sustainability for future generations of farmers. I see no reason why modern farming practices cannot go hand in hand with conservation, environmental enrichment and encouraging bioersity.The Red Kite Retreat project aims to create a unique tourist and visitor facility and focuses on conservation and education about the Red Kite bird of prey, with the creation of the Warriorrsquos Wood the first step in the project.The Wood has been designed to mimic ancient woodland with species adapted to grow in elevated and exposed locations, with the planting including Scots pine, oak, birch, aspen, rowan, hawthorn and juniper.The Scots pine is favoured by native red squirrels which it is hoped will be reintroduced once the woodland has matured, while Juniper is also being established on the site.Updates in the Red Kite retreat are available on Facebook @redkiteretreat, by logging on at www.redkiteretreat or telephone .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_espie.jpg","title":"Castle Espie receives plaudit  ","story":"THE Castle Espie Wetland Centre on the shores of Strangford Lough, which recently hosted the popular BBC wildle programme Autumnwatch, has been praised for its ongoing conservation work.Ards and North Down deputy mayor Robert Adair visited the centrersquos base recently and met BBC programme presenter Gillian Burke and Castle Espie manager Paul Stewart.Cllr Adair said after the huge success of Springwatch at Castle Espie, the television programmersquosfor Autumnwatch has shone the spotlight on the rich wildle of the borough and Castle Espie as an icon of sustainable green tourism.In addition to hosting Autumnwatch, the visit comes as the charity is currently celebrating with a Winter Migration Festival at Castle Espie which includes a series of bespoke events for adults and children alike and runs until November .Cllr Adair said the international importance of Strangford Lough and its exceptional bioersity is a real asset to the environment.ldquoCastle Espie provides a window on the lough with the Winter Migration Festival and filming of Autumnwatch being a fitting way to introduce people to this wonderful asset on our doorstep, he added.Mr Stewart said the centre has been celebrating the natural resource and theof the Brent geese with events in and around Autumnwatch aimed at connecting people with nature.ldquoFrom sunrise yoga, art workshops, walks and talks, to nature focused activities for children, they are all aimed at connecting people to this wonderful place, he explained.ldquoThe worldrsquos wetland habitats like those at Castle Espie actually sequester more carbon than all the worldrsquos forests despite occupying only a fraction of the area around the globe.ldquoAs well as helping to deal with the effects of climate change, wetlands are one of the most bioerse habitats on Earth, protect us from flooding, filter pollutants and help improve our mental health.The Wildle and Wetlands Trust works around the globe, protecting wetland habitats and migratory bird flyways and operates  wetland centres across the UK with Castle Espie the only one in Northern Ireland.The charity recently launched a new lsquoWetlands Can!rsquo campaign, urging people to get behind the leading conservation charityrsquos call for creating , hectares of healthy wetlands in the UK to help combat the climate crisis.Mr Stewart added: ldquoIf the Covid crisis has taught us one thing, itrsquos that we canrsquot go back to how things were before.

The manager of the local service has confirmed that the incident is the first deliberate attack against an on-call GP service in Northern Ireland in the past five years.Mr Mark Armstrong described the

Hynds produced a peerless display aside from that concession, a former Poc Fada competitor, her restarts were struck with precision to wing forwards Katie Black and Niamh Galloway, who in turn fed team captain Joanne Sloane.Straight away, Sloane would angle deliveries into the mobile Maguire. Sloanersquos slick stickwork was impressive, and she had a fine contest versus Bernie Convery throughout.The key battle however, was the dual between Dearg centre back Grainne Glendenning and Belfastrsquos Jessica Rush.With her luminous green boots and helmet, Rush would stand out in any game, but she has the class to back up the bright colours.Winning a huge amount of primary possession, Jessica lsquos jinking, probing runs and vision to find Nicole Clerkin and Niamh Dolan was causing huge headaches for an experienced Ben Dearg defence.Kilcliefrsquos breakthrough goal came in the th minute with Burns finishing brilliantly past Lara OrsquoHare.Clare Kelly and Aacuteine Moynan made timely and brave blocks from Nora Maguirersquos goalbound efforts. The midfield battle was an intriguing and crucial one.Dual star Cara Doran has been on a scoring spree in the football championship this year and she continued her hot streak, with some exceptionally well taken scores from tight angles.Eimear Dorrian was everywhere, covering every blade of grass, never static, always roving, trying to create and make things happen. Dorrianrsquos dynamism and Doranrsquos deadliness contributed hugely to the green and reds display.Niamh McGuigan produced an equally impressive display for the Belfast side. McGuiganrsquos magnetic ability to gain possession in the tightest of spaces is remarkable.Never rushed, despite the chaos around her, she has that precarious talent of always having time, allowing her to scan and assess options, a luxury that only the very top operatorrsquos have.All season, Niamh Daly has also operated at centre field, but cruelly missed out on this final through injury.Brigid Scullion cleverly ped deep to forage for possession, picking up loose ball and linking well with half backs McErlain and Mathers. Kilclief thundered into action with another brace of points from deadly Doran.Her score in the st minute was worthy of the admission fee. Still only  years of age, a career in county colours surely beckons for this gted youngGael.Eimear Breen was a constant outlet for her defence to hit, a player who uses her pace effectively at the right times.With  minutes remaining, Kilclief were edging the contest with a five point cushion. Management Brendan Breen and Seaacuten Paul Doran madetactical tweaks to thwart the increasingly dangerous Clerkin and Dolan axis up front.A double sweeper system was swtly put in place, Cliona Shields and Catherine Deegan were tasked with shutting up shop forming a highly effective shield in front of Ballinascreen stalwart Nicole Clerkin.Nicolersquos space was greatly reduced, but still she battled as hard as possible to cut the deficit. McMullan and Mastersonrsquos masterclass in creating space for goalkeeper Hynds to aim towards, were signicant.McMullan typied the fight and character within the Ben Dearg outfit, as did the industrious Catherine Deegan. Yet, East Belfast pressed with an astounding intensity and relentlessness.That huge work rate comes from having dual players with fierce commitment and blocks of fitness from constant competing, but also from their Bainisteoiriacute Ciaran Hughes and Seaacuten Coulter who encourage their team to play with flair, and they certainly do that, but intense work ethic is paramountyou are to retain a place in this highly motivated team.That competition for places has ensured consistent performance levels all season.Niamh Dolan cleverly created precious space in the congested final third in the th minute, but her angled drive was superbly blocked by Cliona Shields, then swept up bravely by the heroic McMullan, who swtly transitioned to the always available Dorrian.Testament to the synchronisity that is within this Ben Dearg side, Dorrian didnrsquot have to look up to spot the expertly timed run of Burns who showed a deftness of touch to control the sliotar and sail it straight over the black spot.It was a score that comes from playing training together over many seasons. At the other end Aacuteine Moynan and Shannon McWilliams made important blocks, just as Joanne Sloan and Niamh Galloway were about to raise green flags.Clodagh Hanvey made a strong contribution after entering the fray. Maguirersquos maturity and decision making is exceptional for a Gael just turned .With Cara Doran the same age, the future is bright for this Kilclief team. Breen too, displays a shrewd tactical brain, dropping into spaces, covering runs, causing havoc.Doran was awarded player of the match, for her scintillating display, though a case could also have been made for East Belfastrsquos Niamh McGuigan.Niamhrsquos link up play with Jessica Rush was a joy to watch, but equally impressive was her willingness to help team mates in trouble, a true team player.With both teams featuring strong and dynamic forward units, this game was always going to be decided by which defence came out on top.Ultimately, the craft, guile and experience of the Kilclief reargaurd ensured that they closed the game out and got the Championship title they so craved, especially after last yearrsquos heartbreaking defeat to Attical.Euphoric scenes and emotions were unleashed as referee HP McCusker blew his final whistle.Team captain Joanne Sloane spoke from the heart, with a speech that did her club proud. A huge roar went up from the Ben Dearg support whenever she lted aloft the Liam Mac An Ri championship trophy.Each age group at juvenile and now senior level has collected silverware this season, testament to the solid work taking place at their fantastic new facilities in St Malachyrsquos Park.Lorraine MacCartanrsquos priceless contribution in the development of players at the club was highlighted, and deserved praise was duly given to this exemplary East Belfast side.The Ulster Championships now beckon for Kilclief.Referee: H P McCusker .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_kilmore.jpg","title":"Kilmore navigate their way past Maze  ","story":"KILMORE Rec welcomed Lower Maze to Robert Adams Park in the third round of the Peaky Blinders Irish Cup and produced a barn storming second half comeback to progress to round four.With Kilmore two goals down at half-time, having been harshly reduced to ten men after  minutes, the odds were stacked against them.However, a tactical change and a second half performance full of hard work and passion epitomised by man of the match Paddy Grant saw Michael Carvillrsquos men defy those odds and produce one of the most memorable comebacks seen at Robert Adams Park in recent times.Kilmore started brightly but after just eight minutes they failed to clear their lines from a corner, allowing Lower Mazersquos Alex Scott to pick up the ball  yards out and fire through a crowded goal mouth past an unsighted Chris Turley in the Kilmore goals.The task in hand got harder when the referee adjudged Kilmore captain Niall McCarthy to be the aggressor in a midfield confrontation and, to the astonishment of all in the ground, deemed it a red card offence.The injustice of the sending off galvanised Kilmorersquos ten men and they took the game to Lower Maze, dominating possession and creating chances.The first of these saw Caolan Conlon burst through from midfield. His shot was well saved and the rebound fell to Gary Kennedy who fired towards the net only to see Maze lsquokeeper Heron produce a great double save.Cai Gemmel, who was magnicent throughout, saw a goal bound effort deflected wide of the head of a Maze defender as it seemed destined for the top corner.As the chances came and went Kilmore got caught with a sucker punch in the nd minute.Bradford made his way down the left and his mis-cued cross beat a stranded Turley to leave Kilmore two down at half-time and up against it.Carvill changed the shape of the team at half-time and went with a front two of Paddy Grant and Josh Smyth.This change paid idends in the th minute when Grant weaved his way into the box, although it appeared he had been forced too wide, but the forward still managed to fire a rasping drive to the roof of the net.In the th minute a sustained period of Kilmore pressure brought the equaliser, with Grant again involved when his clipped cross was nodded in at the back post by the energetic Josh Smyth.Kilmore continued to dominate and press for the winner, as it seemed as though the game was destined for extra time.In the th minute the pressure finally paid off when Carvill whipped in a corner and that man Grant was on hand to hook the ball home from close range to send the Kilmore faithful into raptures.As Lower Maze then threw everything at Kilmore in injury time, the Blues defence of Magee, Larkin, Kennedy, Stewart and lsquokeeper Turley remained steadfast.Kilmorersquos substitutes of Dagen and Lynas had a chance each on the break for a fourth, but it wasnrsquot to be.Carvill spoke of his ldquoimmense pride in the resilience and determination shown by his side after the match.It came as no surprise that the Kilmore supporters man of the match went to Paddy Grant for his two goals and an assist in a match winning performance.This win sealed double delight for Kilmore, as the club recently secured approval for the installation of a new G football pitch, complete with floodlights, dug-outs, pitch side fencing and associated pathways.Kilmore: Turley, Smyth, Stewart, Larkin, Magee, Gemmell, Conlon, McCarthy, Kennedy, Carvil, Grant.

While Downpatrick has the Fountain Foodbank, Banbridge has a Christian ministry group called J based in the old cinema which will be supporting  families this Christmas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"McKee stands down from UUP  ","story":"MOURNES Ulster Unionist councillor Harold McKee has quit the party.The veteran politician and former South Down MLA has resigned, saying that Doug Beattiersquos leadership of the party is at odds with his religious beliefs.Cllr McKee, who will remain an independent member of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, criticised Mr Beattie for advising members to ldquoleave their Christianity at the door.His resignation comes ahead of next Mayrsquos Assembly election when his wide network of connections across the Mournes area would havebeen a key part of the UUPrsquos drive to secure a seat in South Down.Cllr McKee has confirmed that he intends to serve as an independent ldquoat this point in time with some suggesting that he could potentially be approached by the DUP to join its three councillors on the local authority.He has attacked his former party leader over his stance on abortion, same-sex marriage and a recent vote at Stormont on gay conversion therapy.ldquoIn relation to same sex marriage which Mr Beattie is keen to endorse, I cannot go against the infallible word of God that marriage is between one man and one woman, said Cllr McKee.ldquoI am saddened to observe that these views seem to be of little value in the UUP of today but, rather, a stance of celebrating left-of-centre liberalism seems to be the only acceptable viewpoint.His resignation statement said Mr Beattiersquos leadership was ldquoa far cry from the UUP roots and ldquothe party of Carson and Craig.When Mr Beattie succeeded Steve Aiken as UUP leader earlier this year, he pledged to have a dferent style that would be ldquoable to reach out to all people in Northern Ireland regardless of what your religion is, sexual orientation or ethnicity.Cllr McKee said it was ldquobecoming very dficult to endorse a leader who is constantly to the fore promoting liberal issues while conservative values were being squeezedout. A UUP spokesperson said the party was sorry that Mr McKee had decided his political future no longer lay with the UUP.ldquoWe would like to thank Harold for his service and wish him well for the future, the spokesperson said. ldquoThe party will continue to hold out the hand of friendship as Harold takes a new path.Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis has described the decision by his former colleague to quit as ldquodisappointing.He continued: ldquoThere are many things that I find myself disagreeing with in all parties, not just my own and sometimes I find that it is better to continue to lobby, talk through and progress these issues from the inside, rather than walk out the door.ldquoThatrsquos democratic politics. Nobody is going to call for the gallows just because your opinion dfers, no matter how rigorous the debate. Unionism demands cohesion with the avoidance of ision.Cllr Lewis also thanked his former colleague for his ldquohelp, support, wisdom and guidance since he was elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He added: ldquoI will always consider Harold a friend and fellow unionist. He has overcome personal turmoil and, like many of us, has a strong faith which has encouraged and supported him through dficult times.ldquoI genuinely wish him all the best in whatever he chooses to do next.Earlier this year, DUP councillors Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen quit their party over concerns following the election of Edwin Poots as leader.Mr Poots was subsequently replaced by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP and a short time later Cllr Hanna, who also represents the Mournes area, and Cllr Owen, who represents the Rowallane area, rejoined the party..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_pitch.jpg","title":"New £12m sports pitch at Ballyhornan ‘fantastic facility’ for local community  ","story":"BALLYHORNANrsquoS new G sports pitch has been officially opened.The pound.m investment mdash which includes floodlights and ultra-modern changing facilities mdash has been funded by the Northern Ireland Executiversquos Social Investment Fund and Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Located adjacent to the Ballyhornan Family Centre, the new pitch is already widely used and has brought a number of benefits to the community.The Social Investment Fund contributed pound.m to the new development with the remainder provided by the local authority, with the Ballyhornan Community Association playing a pivotal role in helping secure the funding for the new pitch which was completed in October last year.Designed to increase access to community and leisure services by providing a fit-for-purpose, safe and structured environment to meet the needs and expectations of the Ballyhornan community and surrounding area, the new pitch will make a major contribution to help improve the health and well-being of people in the area.Ballyhornan and District Community Association chairwoman, Patricia Curran, expressed her delight to finally have a completed facility after years of rallying to secure funding for the G pitch which can be used all year round.ldquoWe are very grateful to all the statutory bodies and the local council who supported us throughout this campaign. Without them, we would not have achieved our goal, said Mrs Curran.ldquoThis pitch will be a great asset to Ballyhornan and outlying communities and we are very appreciative of this opportunity to provide a top of the range sports facility.Mrs Curran extended thanks to several people who worked with community officials to secure agreement for the new pitch and deliver it.Special thanks were extended to former local council officer Liam McLernon, Cllr Dermot Curran and former councillor Naomi Bailie for their ldquoimmense support.Mrs Curran also highlighted the support of Celtic Bhoys Football Club which uses the new pitch for its home games. She said the clubrsquos support was essential ldquoin making the project a success.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who performed the official opening, said one of the organisationrsquos key objectives was to improve the health and wellbeing of everyone in the district and reduce health inequalities.ldquoThis new facility will become a thriving hub that will have a hugely positive impact on the local area, benefitting the health and wellbeing of people of all ages by offering improved access to modern sporting facilities, she said.ldquoThis fantastic new facility is an excellent example of partnership working between statutory and voluntary groups and the health and wellbeing impact on our community will be immense.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said the official opening of the new pitch was ldquotestament to the work done by Mrs Curran and the team at Ballyhornan, working alongside officials from a number of organisations and elected representatives.ldquoItrsquos a real joy to see a picture of the late Eddie McGrady in the community centre in Ballyhornan who officially opened the building, he continued.ldquoThis latest development should serve as a reminder as to what can be delivered when communities, political representatives and government bodies work together in a common effort. I can only hope we get to see more of these good news stories in the time ahead.Cllr Curran said he was ldquodelighted to attend last weekrsquos official opening ceremony and thanked the funders of the new pitch for their respective contributions.ldquoThese investments are investments in our community and something we should all be very proud of. However, none of this would have happened without the hard work and determination of Patricia Curran and her team, he continued.ldquoGetting to this point over the past  years was a hard road with plenty of potholes, but Patricia never gave up. I am delighted that with help she get over those hurdles. However, had it not been for her dedication, this new pitch development simply wouldnrsquot have been possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_billy.jpg","title":"Politicians say ‘no’ to plan for school  ","story":"A NUMBER of politicians and school principals are opposed to creating a new integrated education college in the area.The proposed -place Mid Down Integrated Collegewould replace Blackwater Integrated College in Downpatrick, providing sixth-form places.Public consultation into the development proposal brought forward by the MDIC steering group ended in September and the Education Authorityhas already given its response to the parentsrsquo group behind the proposal.However, DUP politicians and three of four post-primary schools in the area mdash Saintfield High School, St Colmanrsquos High School and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch and St Colmcillersquos High in Crossgar mdash have publicly voiced their concerns for the first time.Strangford MLA Harry Harvey said: ldquoI am disappointed that despite widespread opposition locally, the Education Authority continue to press ahead with these proposals. The nearby Saintfield High School, a school supported by the entire community, is in dire need of funding for expansion and refurbishment.ldquoI would call on the EA to listen to the local community and support a truly cross community educational establishment that is already in existence.Cllr Billy Walker, who represents the area, said he will not supporting the development proposal, which he described as ldquoill-thought.ldquoAs an elected representative, I will not be supporting the call for an integrated college in the Mid Down area, he told the Recorder.ldquoFirst and foremost, I want to put on record that I am not opposed to integrated education in any shape or form.Cllr Walker said along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, they lobbied for a new integrated primary school at Drumlins in Ballynahinch and were also instrumental in helping to get the funding to turn Killyleagh Primary School into an integrated school.He continued: ldquoMy credentials speak for themselves. My concern is that we have four post-primary schools in the Rowallane area that have been very successful in the last number of years.ldquoThe four schools are totally opposed to it as this will put serious pressure on these schoolsa new integrated college opens.ldquoThese schools have an excellent track record in working together in a cross-community basis which I have seen at first hand.The councillor claimed he had seen figures to show that Blackwater College was under-subscribed by pupils and local people have made representations to him about the development proposal.He and Mr Shannon recently met with the principals of the four local schools, including The High School Ballynahinch, to hear their concerns.ldquoHow can you honestly push for another integrated school in the Mid Down area when you have another one already under-subscribed, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoIf Blackwater wants to expand, hopefully in the near future Down High will get the go-ahead for its new build which would leave a site for Blackwater to move to. Thatrsquos something I could add my support to further down the line.ldquoBut I will not be quiet on this any longer. I have given a commitment, as has Mr Shannon, to the four schools we have visited that we are % behind their very robust case against which has been submitted to the Education Authority.Tim Jackson, co-chair of the MDIC steering group, said that the development proposal was looking at the future need for an integrated college.The group had already collected  expressions of interests from parents who would send their children to the school,along with  parents who are supportive but donrsquot have children of school age year.He also stressed that the schools had been consulted before the end of the last school year and the public consultation completed by September.ldquoWe feel that people have not understood what our approach and what our proposal is trying to achieve, continued Mr Jackson.ldquoWe are very much about increasing the provision of integrated education in the area, not at the expense of other schools but to support and reflect the support for it in the area and Northern Ireland as a whole.ldquoWe are not about trying to compete with other schools but are trying to deliver something that supports that demand of integrated education. We have had lots of support from local primary schools, many of which are integrated themselves and from other integrated colleges, who you could argue we would be in more competition with.He said that the group had written to every MP and MLA in the area and pointed out that Cllr Walker had not yet been briefed by them.ldquoHe did not take up the opportunity for us to brief him which might have assuaged some of the concerns he has highlighted, said Mr Jackson.ldquoAnd while we are hoping to establish a sixth form, we are not aware that the other local schools have also applied to do something like that.He added that the group were looking at the EArsquos response to the development proposal ldquoin detail as we think that some of our assertions have not been fully understood or appreciated as the EA looks at historical data while we are looking into the future as the urban and geographical landscape changes.Mark Morgan, principal of St Colmanrsquos, described the proposal as a ldquosolo run that disregards accepted protocols and should be dismissed.He added: ldquoIt is imperative that any proposals for change in any sector of the education system must be aligned to the area planning process.Saintfield High School principal Sarah-Lucy Hynds pointed out that irrespective of the proposal, her school would continue to strive for its own expansion.She said: ldquoSaintfield High Schoolrsquos campaign to grow has remained the same for decades. The challenges we face as a result of our capped enrolment at Year  must now be addressed as a matter of urgency.Mr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos, said he was disappointed with the lack of ldquoproper consultation.ldquoOn a very basic level, the proposal ignored the reality that our staff and students already come from erse faith backgrounds and our ethos is and always has been, pupil centred, welcoming and respecting every pupil, regardless of faith or academic ability, he said.ldquoOn a higher level, it ignored the reality that schools must work in partnership to place student needs above institutional interests. An inclusive and imaginative solution would have received our whole-hearted support, but this current proposal unfortunately fell short of this vision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_smell.jpg","title":"Smell in Downpatrick causes stink with MLA  ","story":"A PERSISTENT foul smelling odour which is prevalent in a large part of Downpatrick is to be addressed by Northern Ireland Water.The utility company is to invest in a permanent dosing plant that will be added to sewage before it is pumped for treatment, with the news welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath.He said he had been lobbying for the odour issue to be addressed and had been working with NI Water to come up with a solution to the problem,The foul smell is noticeable in a large part of Downpatrick including the Ballymote Centre and parts of Killough Walk, Glebetown Drive, Bishops Brae Gardens, Mallard Road, Braeside Drive, Vianstown Road, Cathedral View, Pemberton Park and Pegasus Walk.ldquoEssentially we are looking at a quarter of Downpatrick affected by this odour issue, said Mr McGrath.ldquoIt has been a long road to get to this point, but NI Water is working to come up with a solution.

Those who perished in the terrible th century wars interconnect under the schism of Orange and GreenIn relation to the war dead especially those who perished in the terrible global conflicts of the th century those roots interconnect deeply under the great schism of Orange and Green that ides this society.Researching and then writing a new novel based in large part one of my ancestors who fought on the Somme and later at Ypres those shared roots have become more apparent than ever.The book shuttles back and forward from the Western Front battlefields in  to a haunted London Underground station in the st century. Its two main principal characters are fictional versions of my great grandfather Samuel Stewart and one of his great grandsons who like the old veteran had also served in the British Army.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsAlthough Samuel becomes Elijah in the narrativethis man’s home was the same one as my great grandfather’s – in Lower Urney Street off Belfast’s Shankill Road.In one scene I imagined Samuel Elijah ing on home leave to visit his we, a reunion that doesn’t go to plan for him.As he departs from the house and makes his way towards the Shankill Road to catch a tram that will deliver him near Belfast docks Samuel Elijah spots a little girl hiding in the shadows. Barefoot she scurries across the gas lit street and hammers on the door of a house. As the child frantically wraps on the knocker Samuel Elijah notices that the front window has been smashed and replaced with thin cardboard. Beneath this act of vandalism someone has scrawled in chalk: “Rebels Out”. When the girl finally goes inside my main character observes a little trail of blood in parallel with fragments of broken glass leading to the door.It is only a few months after the Easter Rising in Dublin and Samuel Elijah remembers that a Catholic soldier lived with his family also in Lower Urney street and that this brave man was serving over in France with the Connaught Rangers. Samuel Elijah leaves the Shankill even more depressed now than when he left his home a few minutes earlier. The Connaught Rangers’ family were targeted for something that happened  miles south, for something they had nothing to do with and knew little about.This particular scene was in my head long before I picked up and read another far too neglected book about the Irish experience of the Great War.Richard S.Grayson’s ‘Belfast Boys: How Unionists and Nationalists fought and died together in the First World War’ was first published in  and deserves to be deemed a classic in the city’s Great War history. It charts the fate of men from either side of West Belfast’s sectarian ide including the untold stories of Catholic soldiers who fought on the Somme and other battlefields in the th Irish Division. Among Grayson’s superbly researched accounts of Catholic veterans was Connaught Ranger Patrick O’Hare who served a total of  years in the regiment. His service however did not spare him and his family from armed sectarian attackers who trashed their house in Urney Street and drove the O’Hares out of the area they had lived in.This attack occurred on  June  rather than the fictional assault on the family home five years earlier. The context were the sectarian pogroms against northern Catholics as partition became a reality and the state of Northern Ireland was born. Patrick O’Hare survived being told by the ransacking gang that they were going to shoot the ex-British soldier. His grandson Sean explained to Grayson that Patrick was saved by regular British troops manning a peace line between the Shankill and the Falls. The troops acted after one of Patrick’s daughters showed them her father’s military paybook and they intervened to exfiltrate him and his family out of Urney Street.Patrick’s grandson Sean is my uncle having married the sister of my mother in the s. The startling coincidence between the shameful real le targeting of a Great War veteran in  and the attack on the home of the fictional family in the same street following the Easter Rising is uncanny.Moreover, the real ‘Elijah’ lived in the very same street as the Catholic man whose grandson would later marry one of Samuel Stewart’s granddaughters. Who was it who said there are no coincidences!Among other books I devoured while researching the novel was ‘Journey of Remembering’ which lists in alphabetical order the Great War dead of Belfast. It includes Samuel Stewart and also Private Andrew McDonald, a Catholic great uncle on my father’s side of the family.Andrew’s story is particularly poignant as we approach this week’s Armistice Day.He was born in Scotland but grew up in Saul Street in the Short Strand Ballymacarrett district of East Belfast. He served in the Highland Light Infantry and was killed on  October , just almost exactly before the guns fell silent and the slaughter was over.• Other comment pieces below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter• Ben Lowry: A poll that finds support for UK, DUP and ending protocol checks – not something you hear often• Ruth Dudley Edwards Nov : Stephen Nolan seen as a hero in GB for his reports into Stonewall• Henry McDonald Nov : Touching novel raises the plight of Irish world war veterans• Owen Polley Oct : Unconvincing poll was twisted by pundits to support the NI Protocol• Writers Oct : We probe Irish nationalist myths in our new book which defends the Union• Ben Lowry Oct : Theof inflation will suit debtors and punish savers• David Montgomery Oct : Put NI politicians at heart of the talks to resolve the dispute over the protocol• Baroness Hoey Nov : Montgomery article fails to recognise that SF won’t work for the interest of NI• Peter Robinson Oct : SF finance minister’s fiscal policy is to hold out his hand for more UK cash• Henry Patterson Oct : Terror is being legitimised in Basque Country as it is in NI——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Now it seems that the government really is going to invoke Article  of the protocol to suspend the Irish Sea border.There is so much to criticise about the conduct first of Theresa May’s government, which created the problem by accepting without question the nationalist Ireland assessment of what was needed vis a vis Northern Ireland post Brexit, and also that of Boris Johnson.He talked tough until be became PM, thent breezily agreed with Leo Varadkar a protocol that he seemed not to understand.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Lord Frost has acted as robustly as he speaks.This is welcome. It is to be hoped that London maintains this position, despite the bellicose talk from Brussels and the recent warning about British-Irish relations from Micheal MartinArt  is triggered. Those relations were already strained due to relentless nationalism from Dublin, over matters including legacy. Mr Martin is not to blame for that in the way that Mr Varadkar and Simon Coveney but his predecessors have put him in no position.The protocol was agreed under duress, and must be overhauled, regardless of EU threats.• Other comment pieces below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter• Henry McDonald Nov : My family’s roots that bind us to Ypres and the Somme• Ben Lowry: A poll that finds support for UK, DUP and ending protocol checks – not something you hear often• Ruth Dudley Edwards Nov : Stephen Nolan seen as a hero in GB for his reports into Stonewall• Owen Polley Oct : Unconvincing poll was twisted by pundits to support the NI Protocol• Writers Oct : We probe Irish nationalist myths in our new book which defends the Union• Peter Robinson Oct : SF finance minister’s fiscal policy is to hold out his hand for more UK cash• Henry Patterson Oct : Terror is being legitimised in Basque Country as it is in NI——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

While all babies are dferent, it can be helpful to think about working towards a routine by doing the same things in the same order each night so that baby learns what is coming next.Think about your little onersquos sleep environmentIt can be helpful to black out bedrooms, something that can be especially important in the summer months. Temperature is also important the Lullaby Trust, the baby sleep charity, say that the safest temperature for our little ones is - degrees celsius.Looking at how your little one falls asleep can help them get a more settled nightIt is very normal for your little one to be fed, rocked or cuddled to sleep, however this can be dficult to maintain. Practice other ways of getting your baby to sleep in their own sleep space to help find a method that suits you, your baby and your parenting style.Watch out for signs of tirednessWhile there are typical s of time that babies will happily stay awake for, the most important thing is getting to know your baby. By observing your baby, you can try to get them down for naps during the day before they get overtired. It is also important not to try to force naps when they are under tired.Fresh air and exerciseGetting out of the house for a bit will blow the cobwebs away and help your little one to burn off some energy. Inside the home your little one will also benefit from lots of time on the floor to keep them moving, while for small babies practising a bit of tummy time can be really helpful.Donrsquot always rush inhellipSometimes your little one will babble or make noise while they are asleep, and by going in too quickly we can disturb them. Equally they can sometimes wake and be happy in their sleep space. If your little one doesnrsquot need your assistance it is important to give them the space to get themselves back to sleep independently.Take care of yourself and donrsquot be afraid to ask for helpTherersquos no shame in not being able to do it all, all of the time. Being sleep deprived can be incredibly challenging and feel very lonely. Please know that is very normal for sleep to be dficult, especially in those early days. Please remember being a parent doesnrsquot always feel easy, because itrsquos not!

Photo: PacemakerUpper Bann MLA Mrs Kelly was quoted in a newspaper article as saying this week’s PSNI th anniversary was the perfect opportunity to recommit to the principle of a shared police force. The SDLP policing board member also said the creation of the PSNI was a “signicant departure from the institutionalised sectarianism represented by the RUC”.Those comments led to the NI Retired Police Officers’ Association penning an open letter to Mrs Kelly, in which the NIRPOA chairman called on the MLA to withdraw her remarks, and to apologise for the “gross offence” caused.The letter states: “I am writing to seek your immediate withdrawal of that remark, and an apology for the gross offence you have caused to the thousands of members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary GC who served this community in the most challenging of times.”Mrs Kelly responded, saying: “The SDLP has previously paid tribute to the sacrices made by many RUC officers and their families.“The fact remains that there were severe institutional problems within the RUC and this is a matter of public record. That many retired police officers continue to refuse to cooperate with legacy investigations to this day speaks for itself.”Mrs Kelly added: “The transformation of the RUC to the PSNI has been an outstanding success and whilst policing continues to be challenging I think the hard work and efforts of the those involved in implementing Patten’s recommendations deserve credit.”Ulster Unionist policing board member Mr Nesbitt said he believes his SDLP counterpart should “reflect on her comments and the hurt they have caused and apologise”.He said: “The RUC were the barrier between Northern Ireland and complete anarchy. They bravely held the line throughout the Troubles.“Dolores Kelly’s comments have caused great hurt to former officers, their families and friends. Police officers didn’t wake up hoping to hurt someone, but every terrorist did, and it was police officers who were targeted simply because they were trying to protect society and save lives”.Mr Nesbitt added: “Nobody disputes that the RUC could have done with more Catholic officers within its ranks.“I have no doubt that many more would have come forward had it not been for the fact that the IRA made a special effort to target those Catholics who did join the RUC”.Mike NesbittPSNI  \"       \"  Most PopularMike Nesbitt joins calls for apology over MLA’s ‘sectarian’ RUC commentsRoad repairs branded ‘diabolical’Portadown: Four people taken to hospital after two vehicle crashMP Carla Lockhart backs new law to ban illegal ‘puppy farming’ in NIHalloween hooligans’ rampage in Lurgan ‘terried’ residentsMost PopularArtists, young and older, exhibiting at Portadown’s Millennium CourtLuncheon Club is ing to Portadown’s Thomas Street Methodist ChurchMan and woman arrested after woman seriously injured in CraigavonJake Bailey-Sloan: Tributes to young Portadown businessman ‘one of the kindest souls you could ever meet’‘What school grades do I need to join PSNI – and how much will I earn ’                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1632989885154.jpg--top_tips_for_safe_student_accommodation.jpg?163298989300","title":"top tips for safe student accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself.
