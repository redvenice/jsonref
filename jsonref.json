They are bodies you don’t often see in magazines or on social media’Several years ago, when I was back home in Lithuania, I went to the beach for the first time in years. I grabbed my longboard, gathered a group of friends and family, and headed for one of the most popular spots on the Baltic coast.On this beach, there is a bridge that overlooks the shore. As I walked across it, I could see all of the bathers lying beneath me on the sand. I had a perfect bird’s eye view. I had never seen the beach from that angle, and it was fascinating. That evening, I began the research for this series, Comfort Zone. I looked through reams of beach photography, but pretty much none of the images had captured the scene from above. I found nothing documenting it from this angle in this clean, simple, almost clinical way.I wanted to create a typology of beach culture – a kind of study of the phenomenon as if I were investigating a different species. I was thinking about what it would be like to come to Earth as an alien and witness this: what sense would you make of it?As well as my camera, I used equipment to help me to shoot from above while I was moving around at beach level: a four-metre-long pole with an attachment for my camera, and a radio trigger for when I was ready to shoot.It was important that the photos were perfectly candid, so I didn’t tell anyone I was shooting them. But people were looking at me. I realised that the people who weren’t looking at me must be sleeping, so I knew which ones I wanted to photograph.I tried to avoid any conversations or arouse suspicion. I wasn’t doing anything against the law, but the beach is a place where people sometimes don’t feel comfortable being shot. Some people did approach me though – you can imagine seeing the same person every day walking with this strange thing on his shoulders, so they asked me what I was doing. I said I was just taking photos of nature, and if they were persistent with their questions, I would show them images I had taken of the sea or the forest.When those images started to be published, there were some concerns, and people questioned my practice. My view is that I’ve never focused on someone’s personal life: my work is about society, community, humanity – it’s not about one particular person.I took this shot on the first day I started to work on the series. It was nerve-racking: I had no idea how the pictures were going to look and I didn’t know how people would respond to me. That evening at home, I looked through the day’s work. Nothing was right apart from this shot. This image convinced me that the whole project was worth pursuing. For that reason alone, it’s special to me.The image tells a story: you can see the very shade of the woman’s lipstick, you can see the veins in her legs, but despite the specificity of the shot, it’s also oddly surreal. There’s a kind of dissonance in it that appeals to me.As in the rest of the series, the bodies you see are real. They are bodies you don’t often see in magazines, online or on social media. Every day we are bombarded with images of people eating perfectly healthy food and being perfectly in shape, and so many people feel excluded by that. The reality we are so often presented with is utterly distorted and represents the minority of us.I don’t consider the beach as a utopian escape from the city, but it does illustrate how our behaviour is conditioned by social norms beyond our control. Why is it acceptable to be half naked on a beach, but not in a library? Why does our environment dictate what we can and cannot wear? It’s because our behaviour is always being shaped by people around us.In the age of social media, we are obsessed with the concept of iniduality and the idea that we must all be different all of the time. These images show that, on some level, we just do what everyone else does. The inidual is much less important than the collective or the whole.I travelled to other beaches across the world, thinking it would be interesting to document how beach culture differs. What I found is that it doesn’t. We buy the same things, we often read the same things translated into whatever language we speak and we use the same brands a lot of the time. You can see globalisation in action on the beach, and how consumerism shapes all of our lives. But you can also see a kind of commonality, the similarities between us, no matter where in the world we are.Studied: MA in Architecture at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University.Influences: “Everything I have seen and experienced has impacted me.

This must be our call to actionAccording to research published last week by US scientists, hajj is set to become a danger zone. As soon as next year, they say, summer days in Mecca could exceed the “extreme danger” heat-stress threshold. The news comes just weeks after over 2 million people completed their journey of a lifetime. The environmental threat to the holy pilgrimage is a panic button for British Muslims like me, signaling that the climate crisis is endangering an age-old sacred rite.Environmental stewardship may well be advocated by my faith – the Quran states that humans are appointed as “caretakers of the Earth” and the prophet Muhammad organised the planting of trees and created conservation areas called hima – but it hasn’t mobilised Muslims on a mass scale for what the world needs now: a global eco-jihad.Fazlun Khalid, founder of Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences and author of Signs on the Earth: Islam, Modernity and the Climate Crisis, has been on a green mission for over 35 years, but his biggest challenge has been to motivate Muslims. “Islam is inherently environmental, but modernity has induced all of us to distance ourselves from nature. The reason I don’t give up is my grandchildren – what kind of planet will they inherit? How can they perform hajj under those conditions?”Khalid previously gathered a team of scholars and academics who drafted the Islamic declaration on climate change adopted at the International Islamic climate change symposium in Istanbul in 2015 (an event co-sponsored by Islamic Relief, a global charity that is again calling on Muslims to take action now if they want to safeguard the pilgrimage for future generations). Maria Zafar of Islamic Relief UK said: “Hajj has physically demanding outdoor rituals which can become hazardous to humans. It isn’t only Mecca, other sacred sites will be at risk too, like the religious sites in Jerusalem, the Golden Temple in India – it will affect what we hold dear to our hearts. We think that climate change is distant from us, but there is no area of life that it won’t touch.”If we are truly to tackle a catastrophe as huge as the climate crisis, we have to make it personal. Without a personal stake, it remains an abstract and we unite in perpetuating it. So if money is the only form of emotional investment for some, and if economics wields more power than the will to save our planet, we must use it. Next year Saudi Arabia is hosting the G20 summit, so let’s pressure the country to consider the financial threat due to a loss of religious tourism. Hajj is lucrative: economic experts have said revenues from hajj and umrah (a lesser pilgrimage undertaken any time of year) are set to exceed $150bn by 2022.“For the Saudis, hajj is more precious than oil,” says Dr Husna Ahmad, CEO of Global One, who’s been campaigning for a greener hajj for years. Ahmad created a green guide to hajj in 2011, and is now working on a green hajj app, which she plans to launch next year if funding is secured.With approximately 100m plastic bottles left behind each year after the pilgrimage ends, it’s clear that action is desperately needed. Slowly, Saudi authorities are beginning to implement a more environmentally friendly hajj by installing recycling points around the holy sites, and they aim to cut waste volumes by two-thirds by 2030. Pushing for change has been a struggle in the kingdom, but apathy is a wider problem. It’s bound up in socio-economic deprivation, and too often “saving the planet” is seen as something for the rich, a kind of green elitism.“Right now in the UK it feels like middle-class white women – and Sadiq Khan – are the only ones taking up the baton,” says Ahmad. “We know that climate change started with the European industrial revolution and poverty is inextricably linked to that.“People are trying to survive, you can’t blame them if climate change is not their priority. This is why achieving the UN sustainable development goals are high on my agenda.”The climate crisis does not exist in and cannot be tackled in isolation. While the big dogs must green-up their institutions and businesses, grassroots activists need better relations with governing bodies, more Muslims need to get involved with the broader debate and we all need to rethink our lifestyles – cut down on meat consumption, use less packaging and step back from throwaway consumerism.We all have a part to play – institutionally, socially, morally, economically and religiously. Whether it’s through the lens of our conscience, faith or finance, it’s imperative to find our own catalyst for action. If the threat to hajj can motivate Muslims, then that’s all for the good.• Remona Aly is a journalist and commentator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5408cd0b3ca8b88ff00d3de7f4a018f2bb969acb/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82a79484ada0c2aa6065d9479bf217d5","title":"richard ayoade webchat","story":"The director, actor, author, presenter and overachiever is joining us for a webchat on 5 September at 12pm BSTIs there another actor who could deliver the line, “I came here to drink milk and kick ass, and I’ve just finished my milk” with as much deadpan aplomb as Richard Ayoade?Before he became a flipping household name as the painfully geeky Maurice Moss in The IT Crowd, the world has owed the actor, writer, director and flaneur a great debt.

Details of an extra £800m for sixth form and further education colleges were said to be still under discussion with the Treasury.Williamson said: “I’m looking forward to working with all our education unions on our shared goal of giving children and young people of all ages the best possible education and laying the foundations for success in whatever path they choose.”A cross-party group of 93 MPs has signed a letter to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, urging him to prioritise education funding for 16- to 18-year-olds. Signatories include Robert Halfon, the chair of the education select committee, and several former Conservative ministers.The letter calls on the chancellor to raise the base rate of funding from £4,000 to at least £4,760 per student, rising in line with inflation. “It is extraordinary that 16-to-18 education has for so long been starved of cash,” said Halfon. “Funding this age group properly must sit at the heart of a 10-year plan and be a major priority in the forthcoming spending round.”There have been calls that funding for education should be looked at in a similar way to the NHS but according to those at the meeting, a 10-year plan may not be in Williamson’s gift. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Warm words and lingering promises simply won’t do.“We said to the secretary of state for education at our meeting today what we’ve been saying in public for months – that there needs to be an urgent response to the current funding shortfall, plus a longer uplift that builds a sustainable education system for all children and young people, irrespective of their backgrounds.”Another letter sent to the DfE highlighted the crisis in SEND funding in the capital. Signed by 20 boroughs, it said there was a £77m shortfall in funding for SEND services across London last year.Danny Hassell, the lead signatory and Tower Hamlets council cabinet member for children, schools and young people, said: “With demand for services rapidly increasing but funding at a standstill, we have now reached a tipping point with potentially very serious consequences.”A DfE spokesperson said spending on children and young people with the most complex SEND has increased from £5bn in 2013 to over £6bn this year. “The prime minister has also made clear that we will increase minimum levels of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools. Further details will be announced in due course.”The Treasury is being urged to prioritise social mobility in the spending review. The all-party parliamentary group on social mobility has written to the chancellor backing calls for more investment in further education to help boost low levels of social mobility across the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf85ddb65acbe010d614d0d8d595774b35e66f/0_192_4592_2755/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cffca5f3af3c4ca9cd39acb0f98e708","title":"tell us about your treasured charity shop finds","story":"To celebrate Second Hand September we would like to see photos of your favourite charity shop clothesThis September Oxfam is asking people to opt out of buying new clothes and instead go for secondhand items from charity shops.

Our look is 1980s Camden punk. I mean, it’s not like we are Gucci or someone like that.” After meeting with the head gardener at the Gloucestershire royal estate, where there is a strong emphasis on recycling, the designers recruited a team of students from Oxford Brookes University to help harvest 3,000 nettle plants.“The Highgrove team are really relaxed, but it was hard work in hot weather,” says Vin. “You can’t wear shorts or short sleeves, or you’d get stung to death.”When the 10 or so pieces of nettle clothing make it on to the catwalk of the Savoy, on the last day of London Fashion Week, what the audience will see is a “fabric you might think was a type of alpaca, or maybe a very fine fleece”, says Omi. “It’s a wispy, airy sort of texture – you wouldn’t recognise it as nettle at all. That’s the whole point, to make a contemporary garment out of a waste material.”Nettle fibres have been woven into fabric since Roman times, but the designers worked on a new technique whereby the fibrous strings from each stalk were developed into a fluffy, wool-type fibre and processed with environmentally friendly saltwater bleach to take out the green. Jewellery worn with the nettle dresses has also been made from Highgrove plant waste.“What we like about nettles is that they have no value,” says Omi. “Hopefully that challenges the way we think about fashion. Nettles are everywhere, they are a weed, they are an abundant natural resource in this country. We want to start people thinking about how fashion can work with what the environment has on offer, rather than forcing itself on the environment in harmful ways.”Prince Charles is “very appreciative” of the project, say the designers, and has sent letters of encouragement. “Every so often the postman turns up with a registered post letter, bearing the royal seal.” The Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum, in London, has already asked for a piece for its archives.Vin, who is British, began working with Omi, who was born in Singapore and worked for Christian Dior under John Galliano, in 2004. From the outset, sustainability has been their fundamental guiding principle they describe themselves as an ideology as well as a fashion label.The pair, who have dressed Michelle Obama, Debbie Harry and Kate Moss, have partnered with the Savoy as advisers on sustainability. From next spring, the hotel’s doormen will wear a Vin + Omi uniform which will be made from fabric created out of the hotel’s own plastic waste."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/710c3f06a75aa6467252621c4872fc0110810227/0_0_4912_6144/master/4912.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f1f652e6576999d83cb682116fc1e048 1440w","title":"ad astra review brad pitt reaches the stars in superb space opera with serious daddy issues","story":"The actor blasts off in search of long-lost pops Tommy Lee Jones in James Gray’s intergalactically po-faced take on Apocalypse NowBrad Pitt is an intergalactic Captain Willard, taking a fraught mission up-river in James Gray’s Ad Astra, an outer-space Apocalypse Now which played to rapt crowds at the Venice film festival. In place of steaming jungles, this gives us existential chills. Instead of Viet Cong soldiers, it provides man-eating baboons and pirates riding dune-buggies. It’s an extraordinary picture, steely and unbending and assembled with an unmistakable air of wild-eyed zealotry. Ad Astra, be warned, is going all the way - and it double-dares us to buckle up for the trip.Set in the near future, this casts Pitt as Major Roy McBride, a lonesome samurai who prides himself on the fact his pulse rate has never climbed beyond 80. He’s travelling out to Neptune in search of his lost father, a man he barely knows, and seeking to halt a series of unexplained cosmic rays that threaten life on Earth. Pitt embodies McBride with a series of deft gestures and a minimum of fuss. His performance is so understated it hardly looks like acting at all.“In the end the son suffers the sins of the father,” McBride explains in hushed voice-over as his ship noses onward through the blackness. This is because McBride Sr (Tommy Lee Jones) is the film’s Colonel Kurtz, a brilliant astronaut who went AWOL years before and may in some way be responsible for the current crisis. Roy’s bosses at SPACECOMM say they simply want his father brought home whereas in fact they are secretly planning to terminate his command. Roy receives this information with barely a flicker of emotion. His feelings about the old man have always been conflicted he’s not even certain he wants to find him alive. But he still fires out messages and waits for a response.Gray (who also wrote the script alongside Ethan Gross) is an established purveyor of big, brooding, ambitious cinema, from The Yards through The Immigrant to 2017’s Amazonian adventure, The Lost City of Z. But he’s never made anything as ambitious as this soaring psychological space-opera, with its cool surfaces, dark pockets and sudden flashes of violence. Ad Astra is so deadly serious that it verges on the silly so immaculately staged and sustained that it sweeps us up in its orbit.Roy docks at Mars, after which he lights out on his own, 2.7bn miles from home. And it’s at this point that the film begins to fold in on itself, jettisoning its sci-fi paraphernalia (man-eating primates and all) to become an unblinking parable of desperate fathers and damaged sons. Having kept his cool for so long, the astronaut finds that his pulse rate is spiking. So he cuts communication with Earth and prepares to face his demons. He’s travelling deeper and deeper into his own heart of darkness as Ad Astra pitches from full-blown horror to the thunderclap of closure. In space, it transpires, no one can hear you scream for your dad.• Ad Astra opens in the UK on 18 September, in Australia on the 19 September and in the US on 20 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bb70c3e415ed1f5e8a4ef4d1017efee3961a577/0_254_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=916139c2556329296521da383ebd449e","title":"movie posters films never happened superman lives kaleidoscope","story":"Designer Fernando Reza has created a set of imaginary posters for films that couldn’t make it past pre-production, from Tim Burton’s Superman Lives to Alfred Hitchcock’s Kaleidoscope.

For a rich and varied plant-based diet, talk to the Chinese, Indians, Ethiopians … Like most revolutions, the current surge in meat-free eating takes much of its energy from its newness. This is a hip and sexy break with the past, a movement with Silicon Valley solutions to the historic restrictions of a meat-free diet.Consequently, we hear a lot about trashy vegan street food, plant-based wellness and futuristic “bleeding” burgers, but little from those nations where meat-light, vegetarian and vegan food has flourished for centuries. It is bizarre. Such cuisines offer huge inspiration for anyone keen to increase the creativity and flavour of their meat-free cooking. The chef Andrew Wong is baffled by western food manufacturers pouring money into developing mock meats. “Why waste your time R\u0026ampDing this stuff? It’s been done. Just go into Chinatown,” advises the chef-owner at London’s Michelin-starred A Wong.Since Buddhism’s arrival in China about 2,000 years ago, regularly abstaining from meat has been a feature of Chinese life. Wong says a meat-minimal approach to eating is now “ingrained”.“In every province and echelon of society, people understand food is medicine and eating too much meat is not good. In old recipes, there’s never a massive amount of protein. My grandmother would cook vegetable dishes and use a small amount of meat as a lubricating source of oil.”In the Forbidden City’s imperial court, that absence of meat spawned highly playful food theatre in which other ingredients were used to mimic meat. Today, Chinese chefs and food producers simulate meat and fish textures using vegetables, gluten and tofu in endless ingenious dishes and products. In these, mushrooms might pass for eel or offal, for instance, or gently cooked egg whites for crab meat.Despite being widely available in the UK’s Chinese supermarkets, many of the core ingredients in this cooking are little known outside Chinese kitchens. “When westerners think of tofu,” Wong says, “they think of one hard, claggy 80s product, not the variety and finesse in 50 types of tofu all specific to inidual dishes. Now you can get tofu as smooth as creme brulee. Bean curd skin, a tofu by-product, is versatile, too. You can fry and crisp it, steam things in it to give them a skin-like texture or cook it over fire, to create this crunchy, cheesy, stringy thing.”All this mimicry is underpinned by numerous fermented ingredients that build umami flavours into dishes: “Bean curd or chilli bean paste, dried black beans, preserved dried vegetables – these all add layers of savouriness that fool your brain into thinking there must be meat there.”Some Ethiopian staples, such as injera, a tangy, pancake-like bread made from fermented batter, can take years to master. “Sometimes, even I don’t get what I really want,” laughs Melaku, who uses wheat flour, not the traditional teff, in her injera. Export, she believes, is exacerbating the soaring cost of teff back home, so she adapted: “Why do I need to bring teff from my people, taking what they can’t even afford? I can’t do it.”However, from breakfast beso, a pan-toasted barley flour porridge, to tikil gomen, a cabbage and fried potato dish seasoned with whole jalapeño, there are easier ways into Ethiopian cooking. On fasting days, families often enjoy beyaynetu, inidual vegetarian platters where dishes such as fasolia (green beans in tomato sauce), gomen (simmered greens), shiro (a highly seasoned chickpea flour paste similar in texture to pease pudding) and thick, spicy wat stews are all served on an injera flatbread.From misir (red lentil) to atakilt (cabbage, potato and carrot), wat stews of just a few ingredients, perfumed with hot berbere spice mix, are central to Ethiopian cooking. Find a high-quality berbere and take time with the wat’s onion base. The onions must be finely chopped and gently sweated until utterly broken down, which can take over an hour. “We do everything by the book and by hand,” says Melaku.Mayur Patel, co-owner of the northern Bundobust restaurants, insists the Gujarati food he grew up on is “simpler than it’s made out. All the ingredients are available in Asian supermarkets everywhere and we don’t use dozens of spices. It’s more about how you combine and cook them – say, adding the garam masala at the beginning or end, which creates completely different flavours.”You do not need to understand the Ayurvedic roots of meat-free Hindu cooking (certain “hot” foods are thought to dangerously excite the senses, yet fresh green chillies are somehow “calming”) to get to grips with Patel’s beloved dhal baht, “like Indian gravy that you add to rice”, or bataka shak, a dry-fried potato curry. Instead, you need to stock up on seasonings (mustard seed, fenugreek, coriander powder, cumin, asafoetida and curry leaves), buy a pressure cooker to speed up all those lentils you will be cooking and, importantly, perfect your tempering to either start a curry or finish one with a flourish.“Starting by tempering oil with fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds and ground onion is fundamental. That gives you that savoury, jammy, umami flavour, like Marmite. Then, as you add fresh ingredients – green beans, aubergines, potato – you get different textures coming out. Okra, for instance, really thickens the base. It’s like making a cocktail, combining and blending vegetables. I think that gives you more creative space than basing a dish on one simple protein.”It is a learning process. But you have Google and a head start, in that most Britons are familiar with the flavours of Indian food, if not the vast hinterland of Indian regional or even Gujarati cooking. Patel, for instance, is obsessed by his mum’s khandvi, pillowy pasta-like rolls made with gram flour and yoghurt.Salvo’s serves 19 vegetarian dishes and 10 meat-free sides. The Leeds Italian has a dedicated vegan menu, too. The co-owner Gip Dammone relays these stats to demonstrate how, as the son of southern Italians – mum from Campania, dad from Sicily – he has a love of high-quality seasonal vegetables and vegetable dishes in his DNA.The Dammone family lived in Salerno in the 70s: “We were almost naturally vegetarian without knowing. Meat was an expensive commodity, utilised sparingly. Mum would send me to the butcher’s, but I never ordered more than 100g of meat. A meat ragu wasn’t a load of mince you’d be excited to find a scrap of meat in there. We’d have mainly bread meatballs or often ‘meatballs’ made with diced, fried aubergine.”In the poorer Italian south, families had learned to cook without (much) meat and, making a virtue of a necessity, use every last scrap of the beautiful produce growing in the rich volcanic soils of Puglia and Campania. Turnip tops went into pasta with capers and anchovies bitter lettuces were stewed with garlic, oil and water “ amazing” quarter-inch-thick slices of aubergine (known as la carne del popolo, the meat of the masses), were dipped in egg, floured and fried, years before the cauliflower steak. On the courgette-mad Cilento coast, you would see sliced courgettes drying on balconies, so when they were fried, they browned quickly: “They know how to process veg in southern Italy.”Understandably, Dammone is mystified by meat substitutes such as seitan: “It’s like boiling dough. There’s a better mouthful in a lot of veg.” This is something he is reminded of every time he visits Italy, where “vegetables are still revered in their own right”. Could demanding far better vegetables be the key to unlocking Britain’s meat-free future?Jamaica: Ital, a belief system focused on increasing “livity” or life-energy, whose purest adherents eat only organic, vegan food, developed alongside Rastafarianism in 30s Jamaica. Check out the bean and pumpkin curries and stews at Negril in Brixton, south London, or Liverpool’s street-food outfit Ital Fresh. Think jerk-marinated cauliflower wings.Vietnam: In Vietnam, Mahayana Buddhist dietary rules gave rise to dedicated meat-free dishes and veggie versions of everyday staples, such as banh mi sandwiches and noodle bowls. For his much-praised book Vegetarian Việt Nam (£25, WW Norton), Cameron Stauch spoke to monks and home cooks to get the skinny on daily dishes and specials, such as the Twelve Predestined Affinities Salad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/315ac41beed5150bda3e44c91355b2a8b44fbbb3/0_30_4081_2450/master/4081.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c63d7903f5ccd66fa9601b61c641ce13","title":"belgium england women football friendly match report","story":"Defensive chaos led England to give away a two-goal lead in Belgium before earning a draw through a Nikita Parris penalty, thus marring the start of their run to the 2021 Euros and the night Lucy Bronze won the Uefa Women’s Player of the Year award.Phil Neville said he was disappointed that Uefa held the awards ceremony on the night of England’s friendly meaning Bronze was unable to attend: “It’s a big moment in her life, that I know that I’d want my family to share with me and I’d want to be in Monaco myself.“I think Uefa have issued something to do that they are going to look at it and it’s the right thing to do. It would have been nice for her to celebrate in Monaco tonight with the most unbelievable players on the planet.”It is rare that a friendly will draw so much attention but, this being the first outing of Phil Neville’s side since the World Cup, there was a higher degree of curiosity. This was the start of the new two-year plan. And there was an added celebratory feel, with Bronze having beaten her Lyon teammates Ada Hegerberg and Amandine Henry to Europe’s top player prize.However, two goals from Ella van Kerkhoven and an own-goal more than cancelled out England’s two from Jodie Taylor and Beth Mead before Parris levelled in a match that added to concerns over England’s defensive frailty.Within minutes of the start Bronze showed a glimpse of why Neville is so keen to try her engine in the middle, busting a gut to chase a loose ball. Having underwhelmed in her brief pre-tournament midfield outings, Bronze stayed in her more traditional right-back berth at the World Cup.But it is an idea that has stuck with Neville. And, particularly in the context of a light midfield – Jill Scott was rested and Izzy Christiansen and Jordan Nobbs are yet to return from injury – it makes sense. Few in the England camp play with the confidence and relentless drive of the Lyon defender.“The occasion at St George’s Park when we presented her with the trophy the other day, she had no idea,” said Neville grinning. “She is not emotional but she was genuinely proud and so too were all the team.”England’s first goal came from an equally exciting source: the 20-year-old Georgia Stanway, who was playing in the number 10 role usually occupied by Fran Kirby (out with injury), where she was fleetingly positioned at the SheBelieves Cup and in France. She stopped in space on the edge of the Belgium box before slipping a light curling ball between two defenders and round a third, inch perfect to the feet of Jodie Taylor, who could not fail to score. It was a moment of brilliance from the young Manchester City forward who seems to be coming of age following an assured season capped with an FA Cup final goal.In a sign that Bronze’s shift could spell danger at right-back – Rachel Daly is good, but not European player of the year good – the Houston Dash player was left for dead by Elena Dhont, whose end product was lacking.Moments after the opener Taylor turned provider but the hard work was done by Bronze. Going to ground under a challenge, she managed to backheel the ball to Taylor, whose shot was palmed into the path of an incoming Beth Mead who doubled the lead.Twelve minutes later Bronze was on the back post to poke a Heleen Jaques header from a corner off the line, but a scramble to recover the ball saw it ping-pong between Bronze and Carly Telford and slip painfully over the line to reduce Belgium’s arrears.Belgium punished England again moments before the break. Manchester City’s Tessa Wullaert beat Daly with ease on the left and swung a cross in. Ella van Kerkhoven slipped into acres of space between Steph Houghton and Abbie McManus and headed home with ease.More chaos in the box – a feature of England’s World Cup campaign and, worryingly, Neville’s tenure in general – gave the hosts the lead. The Red Devils broke at pace but with seven players back Houghton should have been able to clear. However, she fatally prodded the ball straight to Van Kerkhoven, who fired in from close range.The visitors laboured without much joy until a handball off the arm of Tine de Caigny gave them the chance to level. Up stepped Parris, who was relieved of penalty duty for the World Cup semi-final against the USA following consecutive misses, to power the ball high into the net.Neville was disappointed but philosophical: “We conceded three poor goals and I feel as though, with the plan we have for the next three camps, we might have to suffer some pain a little bit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb202a3e81fdc30a0c1395f6f78741ac7a8acb84/0_45_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b65e2f6475e2ae00c3d1a2d39488d6f","title":"champions league group guide liverpool spurs manchester city chelsea","story":"The English teams have received favourable draws but there is still plenty of intrigue in this season’s competitionFour years ago, two better iterations of Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain slugged it out at this stage. The La Liga side topped the group and proceeded to win the tournament the French champions finished behind them and reached the last eight. This time around the creaking giants may feel thankful that they avoided any of the banana skins available in the lower pots.Now that Real Madrid and Gareth Bale are playing happy families, the Wales forward’s experience at this level may yet help give them the edge they will need him because Eden Hazard is not yet fit and there are already some doubts about the new striker from Eintracht Frankfurt, Luka Jovic.Not that Paris Saint-Germain, scarred by three round of 16 exits, necessarily take the upper hand. Neymar may be long gone when the group stage begins but, for all the forward’s baggage, his departure would cut a gigantic hole in Thomas Tuchel’s attacking resources. The manager will surely not survive another flat campaign in Europe.Club Brugge, who have signed Simon Mignolet and are courting Victor Wanyama, will feel they can pip Galatasaray to third position.It would take a calamity or two for Tottenham to be forced into a repeat of last season’s salvage operation although, on current form, they will take nothing for granted. A much-changed Bayern side – Ribéry, Robben, Rodríguez, Hummels out Coutinho, Perisic, Pavard and Hernández in – should be re-energised and can still rely on Robert Lewandowski, who scored his latest hat-trick against Schalke at the weekend. Should Spurs lose Christian Eriksen, they may lose the X factor that puts them in control.They will remember, too, that Red Star Belgrade defeated Liverpool last year. The Serbian champions fancy a shot at third place and will contest perhaps group stage’s most romantic clash when they face Bayern, who they defeated en route to winning the 1990-91 European Cup in one of the competition’s great contests. It will be Spurs’ first trip to the Marakana since a Uefa Cup tie in 1972.Olympiakos beat an impressive Krasnodar side in the play-offs this week and have passed through the group stage four times before. But, while the veteran winger Mathieu Valbuena is a new addition to their squad, it is hard to see them or Red Star toppling the front runners.Manchester City may yet receive a Champions League ban in the coming months but their participation this season has scant chance of finishing early. For the third consecutive season they will face Shakhtar Donetsk and, having won their meetings in 2018-19 by an aggregate of 9-0, will see little cause for concern. Shakhtar have not lost a domestic league match for over a year but their outstanding manager, Paulo Fonseca, left for Roma this summer and it is hard to see Luis Castro coaxing a dramatic improvement.Dinamo Zagreb beat Arsenal in their most recent group stage appearance four years ago but lost their other five games a battle for third looks their best bet this time but the famed Maksimir Stadium atmosphere may not compensate for a lack of top-level quality.The group’s most interesting side is Atalanta, who will probably be the nearest approximation to a challenger for City. Their Champions League debut was well-earned and, under Gian Piero Gasperini, they played some of Europe’s most vibrant football last season. Martin Skrtel has been brought in from Fenerbahce to add a layer of steel.Atlético certainly have a score to settle against Juventus, who overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit to defeat them in last season’s round of 16. That was entirely owing to a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick Juventus got no further and the forward, who turns 35 this season, knows his chances of adding to his five titles are running out.Ronaldo will be as important as ever to Juve, for whom a slightly curious summer’s business has seen Aaron Ramsey and Adrien Rabiot arrive on free transfers and Matthijs de Ligt make his high-profile move from Ajax. Gianluigi Buffon is also back for one last crack but they may still have to rely on Gonzalo Higuaín while there are suggestions Paulo Dybala and Mario Mandzukic could yet leave. Atlético, for all the bad bood of Antoine Griezmann’s departure, have started their season with successive 1-0 wins and can luxuriate in the €126m presence of João Félix – not to mention England’s Kieran Trippier.Bayer Leverkusen will be weakened by Julian Brandt’s departure for Borussia Dortmund Lokomotiv Moscow will surely offer little more than an awkward away trip or two.This lineup does Liverpool’s prospects of defending their title little harm. They traded wins with Napoli last season but it is hard to make a case that Carlo Ancelotti’s team is dramatically stronger this time, although the Mexico forward Hirving Lozano is an exciting acquisition from PSV Eindhoven and Kostas Manolas brings defensive quality – and a taste for drama, as he showed against Barcelona two seasons ago – from Roma.Red Bull Salzburg arrive in the group stage after a succession of near-misses and a lively young team will cause problems even though their successful manager, Marco Rose, left for Borussia Monchengladbach in pre-season. Sadio Mané and Naby Keïta will, if the latter is fit, be able to face the side they both represented earlier in the decade. Salzburg have a fine record of developing African players and the 19-year-old Mali forward, Sekou Koita, may be the latest off the production line.Perhaps Salzburg will be able to trouble Napoli in the hunt for a last-16 place. Genk, in their first appearance since 2011-12, look unlikely to do that on the evidence of last season’s Europa League.Will the alarm bells be ringing for Barcelona? Slavia Prague’s presence does not quite make this a “group of death” but the inclusion of Inter Milan, now managed by Antonio Conte, provides a curveball that will make the five-time winners sweat. Inter mean business, as the arrivals of Romelu Lukaku and Diego Godín have shown Alexis Sánchez has followed and the Serie A side, who last reached the knockout stage in 2011-12, look a different beast to the one they met in Group B last season.Back then, Inter held Barça to a draw at San Siro but fluffed their lines against Spurs and PSV Eindhoven, missing a glorious chance to get through. This time they will look to capitalise on Lionel Messi’s absence with a calf problem, as well as any teething problems Neymar experiences if his return goes through. Antoine Griezmann is, at least, now off the mark for Ernesto Valverde’s reshaped side while Frenkie de Jong will only get better.Meanwhile Borussia Dortmund, who have purred through the Bundesliga’s opening fortnight, look stronger than last year and will be better for the return of Mats Hummels. If everyone clicks, this group could provide the best drama.There is little stardust here but is certainly the most evenly-matched group. Zenit and Benfica may have felt smug about drawing one another but will face arguably the strongest teams from the other two pots, with every chance the order could be turned on its head.RB Leipzig, who finished third in a similarly tight quartet two seasons ago, look well set to improve on that this time. Julian Nagelsmann’s reign has begun with consecutive impressive wins in the Bundesliga, while they have retained key players and added the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Christopher Nkunku. Timo Werner is a lethal striker and their creative hub, Emil Forsberg, cannot currently get into a starting XI that is firing on all cylinders.Last season Lyon shocked Manchester City but, with Sylvinho in charge and the likes of Tanguy Ndombele, Nabil Fekir and Ferland Mendy having departed, their appearance has changed somewhat. They have a goalscorer in Moussa Dembélé and should have too much for Benfica, who are now shorn of the brilliant youngster João Félix. If, as expected, Zenit fall short them Russia’s top-seed status will be in serious jeopardy.Chelsea, bereft of Eden Hazard and David Luiz, might have hoped for a softer hand from the lower pots but will be happy enough to have avoided any of the heavyweights. Whether that statement does a disservice to Ajax depends on how quickly last season’s darlings recover from losing Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt their principles will not change but they toiled at times during their play-off win over Apoel Nicosia and a repeat of their run to the last four may be a long shot.Frank Lampard may also be encouraged by the way Valencia, to whom Chelsea have never lost in six Champions League meetings, fell short in last season’s Europa League semi-final against Arsenal. Maxi Gómez should offer the Spanish side more cutting edge, though, while the goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen is a handy arrival from Barcelona who will enjoy a reunion with Ajax.Valencia are, in fact, the only member of this group not to have lost key outfield players over the summer. Lille sold Nicolas Pépé to Arsenal, with Rafael Leão and Thiago Mendes also leaving the Ligue 1 runners-up, but the Nigerian forward Victor Osimhen has made a flying start and will need attention."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe7bfe68db75eef639a4a8ca0f6f50a0ca0d4271/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04f9034081f7ad610761e5152db09799","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Watford need points, Everton need goals and Brighton need to be boldWhen did Tottenham last play well in a league game? Arguably not since their Boxing Day thrashing of Bournemouth, a win they followed up with a drab home defeat to Wolves three days later. The latter display became far too commonplace as the campaign rolled on, with a light squad wearied by the run to the Champions League final and possibly distracted by Mauricio Pochettino’s grumbling in public. Pochettino has seemed unsettled for a while and last weekend’s defeat by Newcastle means Tottenham have lost 15 league games in 2019.A massive improvement is required for the trip to Arsenal, though that will probably only be achievable if Pochettino restores Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen to the starting lineup. The threat posed by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette in Arsenal’s attack means that Vertonghen should replace the jittery Davinson Sánchez in defence, while Tottenham’s creative struggles against Newcastle were a reminder of what they would be losing if Eriksen is sold before the European transfer window shuts on 2 September. JSDespite his public claims to the contrary, Ole Gunnar Solskjær must be concerned about the poor form of Jesse Lingard. The Manchester United midfielder has provided no assists and just one goal in his past 20 appearances, a worrying return from exactly 22 hours spent on the pitch.While Solskjær says Lingard has “been a big part of our team and will continue being an important part”, he had no compunction in replacing the 26-year-old with Mason Greenwood after 55 minutes of United’s match against Crystal Palace last weekend. AtSouthampton, the 17-year-old is likely to start in place of the injured Anthony Martial and with Alexis Sánchez gone on loan to Inter, it will be no surprise to see the berth behind Greenwood occupied by Juan Mata. BGThe only team not to collect a Premier League point, Watford are rock bottom of the table and will play a Newcastle side buoyed by last weekend’s win at Spurs. A 3-0 Carabao Cup win for Watford against Coventry in mid-week was expected but it did also provide a ray of hope for the Hornets going forward, in the form of their record £30m signing Ismaïla Sarr, who made his full debut after missing pre-season due to international commitments. The Senegalese winger is outrageously talented but also looks as though he’s got the mental fortitude to thrive in the English game, dealing with some ugly early challenges before going on to score. “Their full-back hit him a couple of times,” said Adrian Mariappa. “I think it was a, ‘Hello, welcome to England’ sort of thing. He got up, dusted himself down and showed what a player he is.” Without the injured Troy Deeney, Javi Gracia will surely be desperate to get Sarr into the XI for the trip to St James’ Park. MBMost of the focus will be on the wonderful James Maddison when Leicester host Bournemouth, but the midfielder will not be the only young British talent hoping to catch the eye at the King Power Stadium. For Leicester, Hamza Choudhury will hope to continue his impressive start to the season in central midfield and Harvey Barnes will hope he has done enough to earn a rare start after coming off the bench to score the winneragainst Sheffield United. As for Bournemouth, a couple of Welsh youngsters have caught the eye, with Chris Mepham making two starts in central defence and on-loan Liverpool midfielder Harry Wilson scoring a spectacular free-kick last week. With Brendan Rodgers at Leicester and Eddie Howe at Bournemouth, youngsters at both clubs should continue to flourish. JSChris Wilder was grumpy following his team’s defeat at the hands of Leicester City and his mood will hardly have improved by his decision not to bother going to Headingley the next day despite having a ticket for what turned out to be a quite remarkable day of Ashes cricket. A midweek Carabao Cup win over Blackburn will have put the smile back on his face, not least because Ravel Morrison excelled in a Sheffield United lineup boasting 10 changes. “There’s still a little way for him to go,” said Wilder, upon being asked about Morrison’s fitness. “But he’s within touching distance of it now and he’ll bring a lot to the table for us.” Whether the brooding, enigmatic midfielder starts against Chelsea remains to be seen, but he seems sure to play some part. Aged 26 and already at his 10th club in five different countries, this once precocious talent needs to prove that he has not left a great future behind him. BGPlenty of teams come away from Turf Moor with three points, but none of them truly enjoy the experience. Burnley’s fibrous, streetwise approach make them the closest the modern footballer will get to playing Wimbledon at Plough Lane. Liverpool were beaten in 2016-17, needed an injury-time winner from Ragnar Klavan in 2017-18 and came from behind to win last season. That match is best remembered for Joe Gomez suffering a fractured leg after a strong but fair tackle from Ben Mee. After the match there was a full and frank exchange of views between Sean Dyche and Jürgen Klopp, who criticised Burnley’s ‘dangerous’ approach. Dyche also accused Daniel Sturridge of ing during that game, and it’s not hard to imagine a scenario whereby both teams ascend the moral high ground once again. Liverpool will doubtless highlight Burnley’s robust approach, while Dyche’s recent comments on ing will reappear should Mohamed Salah have any gravitational issues. RSEverton have only scored once in their first three league games, a poor return for a side hoping to break into the top six this season. Despite another impressive outlay in the summer they still lack a clinical finisher and although Marco Silva has plenty of options in the forward positions, this squad’s edge remains blunted by the sale of Romelu Lukaku to United two years ago. Dominic Calvert-Lewin has not scored since March and Moise Kean will need time to settle in England after his move from Juventus. Not that it is just down to the strikers. If Silva’s attack is malfunctioning, then the creative players also need to accept some of the blame. After all Gylfi Sigurdsson has only passed to Calvert-Lewin three times this season and Alex Iwobi, a £34m summer signing from Arsenal, often flattered to deceive in the final third for his previous club. Everyone needs to step up against Wolves. JSCrystal Palace are crying out for a striker that is even remotely prolific and in Christian Benteke, Connor Wickham and Jordan Ayew don’t appear to have one that readily fits the bill. Benteke’s struggles in front of goal have been well documented, the injury-plagued Wickham has never particularly convinced in the top flight, and Ayew has just two Premier League goals to his name in a little over a season at Palace. The Ghanaian international got off the mark for this season at Old Trafford, but will need to chip in with plenty more if he is to justify the faith that prompted Roy Hodgson to offer him a three-year deal this summer. Bagging his second in two games against his former club Aston Villa would go some way towards doing so. BGThe league table never lies. But sometimes, especially early in the season, it can be economical with the truth. Norwich are 17th in the table, roughly where most people expect them to be at Easter, yet they have been one of the more eye-catching teams of this burgeoning Premier League season. The intrepid charm of their football, and the expert finishing of Teemu Pukki, has made a virtue of defeats to Liverpool and Chelsea. Norwich should great to watch all season, but they will need to improve in defence if they are to avoid relegation. The influential Christoph Zimmermann returned after injury in the Carabao Cup at Crawley and though he suffered a fresh back problem, he should be fit to make his Premier League debut at West Ham. At 26, Zimmermann is a relative veteran Norwich’s first-choice back four has an average age of just under 22. They are all highly talented, but with such a young defence comes an inevitable naivety that can be costly, especially away from home. Any team can concede four at Liverpool. Norwich’s performance at West Ham should give us a better idea of where they will be when the league table reveals the full truth at the end of the season. RSLet’s face it, Manchester City are probably going to beat Brighton. But the last time Graham Potter managed a team that was this much of an underdog (City currently 112 on) he was in charge of Ostersunds, who shocked Arsenal at the Emirates in the Europa League, winning 2-1 in 2018, by playing expansive, exciting – and risky – football. Three-nil down from the first leg, the Swedish minnows went for broke, pressing Arsenal into tactical and inidual errors from the off and showed ruthlessness in front of goal. This was no smash and grab, Ostersunds played Arsenal off the park. Nobody is suggesting that Brighton are going to do that on Saturday, but a similar approach is Potter’s best hope of getting something out of the game. City have lost just one home league match defeat to non ‘Big Six’ opposition in over three years (Crystal Palace last season) – put simply, the low-block almost never works. Be brave, Brighton.

For a year they were held in captivity, and were raped. They managed to escape their captors, and find their way across the desert to a camp in Madinatu, in Borno state.Though they had made it to relative safety, life in the camp was hard for the traumatised teenagers. They had had no contact with their family since their abductions, and there was little to eat. They had to fend off unwelcome advances by local community law enforcers, including members of the Civilian Joint Task Force, who, they say, offered food in exchange for sex.“It was so frustrating having to beg for food, and coming into contact with people who only wanted to exploit us,” says Aisha. “We were ready to do anything to leave Madinatu.”One morning as the girls went in search of firewood outside the camp, a group of women stopped them, asking them if they would be interested in work as hairdressers in Italy.“They told us we would be well paid, and that we’d be given a place to stay,” says Halima. “We were so happy we were going to leave all our troubles in Madinatu and make money abroad.”The women were traffickers. Aisha and Halima were taken to central Nigerien city of Agadez, to a “connection house”, where they were instructed to wait until the smugglers were ready to continue their journey through north Africa for the Mediterranean crossing. Their arrival had coincided with a government crackdown on smugglers, and they found themselves moved from one house to another to escape arrest. When finally they were driven from the city towards the southern Libyan town of Sebha, their trafficker spotted a police convoy patrolling the route through the desert. Worried he would be apprehended, he ordered the girls to get out of the car and drove away.Abandoned in the desert, the girls feared for their lives. “We almost died of heat, and had to drink our pee to stay alive,” says Halima. They were rescued after about two hours by a passing car, who took them back to Agadez. There, a Nigerian woman took pity on them, giving them cash to pay their fare back to the Nigeria.Aisha and Halima’s story is all too common. Unofficial reports based on survivors’ testimony and local data suggest there have been at least 17 cases of trafficking out of Madinatu camp in the last two years. The majority of the victims were girls aged under 18.The situation is reflected across the region. The 2019 US State Department Trafficking in Persons report revealed that “sexual exploitation, including sex trafficking, of IDPs in camps, settlements, and host communities around Maiduguri remained a pervasive problem”. It noted that security personnel are also involved in this criminal activity.When they finally returned to the Madinatu camp, Aisha and Halima made it their mission to warn other girls against the dangers of trafficking. They became involved with the Caprecon Development and Peace Initiative, which educates girls in refugee camps on how traffickers make their approaches, and the huge risks involved. Aisha and Halima are now part of the organisation’s advocacy, and campaign against trafficking in Madinatu.“These people are criminals, who have no jobs to offer anybody,” Aisha recently told a group of women at the Madinatu camp. “When you fall into their trap, they sell you into slavery.”Another girl at Madinatu, Sarah, is also involved with the campaign, after surviving a similar fate to Aisha and Halima. When she was 15 years old, Boko Haram attacked the camp where she lived, killing her mother, and abducting and raping Sarah.She escaped to Madinatu, but desperate over the lack of food at the camp, she turned to prostitution on the streets of Maiduguri. There she met a woman who offered the chance of work in a hairdressing salon in Italy – but like Aisha and Halima, she only made it as far as Agadez. After some months of waiting in a connection house, she was told she needed to go into sex work to pay her rent. She escaped.“I came back feeling so devastated and worried about my future,” Sarah says. “It felt like I had lost everything, including my soul, to the trafficker.”With support from Caprecon, the three girls have formed their own group to keep watch over the camp. Working with them are fellow trafficking survivor Nana Abdullahi, who was taken to Niger in 2015, and Hajja Alooma, who was approached by a trafficker in 2018.“We thought that just talking to women and children about trafficking would not be enough to stop traffickers from targeting them,” says Halima.Every morning, the girls note which children leave the camp, and where they are going, and then search for them if they have not returned three hours after their departure.“We want to be sure that they are not going to meet someone who could turn out to be a trafficker,” says 16-year-old Hajja, who rejected an offer to work as a salesgirl in Niger from a man she met in Maiduguri because she felt he wasn’t genuine. “If we are not very watchful, more children will fall into the hands of human traffickers.”When strangers come to the camp, the girls welcome them politely and ask them the reason for their visit.“If we are not satisfied … we invite the vigilantes working near the camp to interrogate the person,” says Nana Abdullahi, whose male trafficker met her on the streets of Maiduguri, where she sold fruit to earn money. He had promised to help get her a job outside the city. “If there is reason to hand over suspected traffickers to the police, the vigilantes will do so.”One afternoon, the girls spotted a young woman who had walked into the camp and was speaking to some children there. They confronted her, and when she couldn’t explain the reason for her visit, they summoned local community law enforcers.“She couldn’t escape because many girls had surrounded her,” says Nana, who escaped from her trafficker at the age of 15. “We then handed her over to the vigilantes, who set her free after warning her never to set foot in the camp again.”It is when girls leave the camp in search of water, firewood and food that they are particularly at risk, explains Jibrin Bukkar, Caprecon’s project coordinator. “Traffickers always keep a close eye on the movement of women and girls.”Caprecon is not the only organisation working to protect Madinatu’s most vulnerable from being exploited. “We are encouraging women and girls to stand up against trafficking and report to us any incident of abuse and exploitation, by anyone, including security officials,” says Yusuf Mohammed, who oversees the Madinatu unit of the Borno Community Coalition, a group of local leaders and humanitarian workers assisting survivors of the Boko Haram insurgency in Borno state. “Our role is to protect women and children from being exploited by selfish iniduals and groups.”The girls in the group supported by Caprecon are under no illusions about the importance of their work. “We want to make sure traffickers stay away completely from IDP camps,” says Halima."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1049369af10891416a5acd230a8f5f07765508e/0_109_4240_2545/master/4240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d066261646234d39219d2219d47e758","title":"invest or pay the price more than half of refugee children not in education","story":"UN refugee chief warns of generation condemned to grow up unable to find work, as special education envoy Gordon Brown calls for urgent fundingMore than half of the world’s 7.1 million school-age refugee children are failing to get an education despite recent spikes in enrolment rates, the UN refugee agency has found.School shortages, oversubscribed classrooms and a lack of teachers in host countries are among the barriers faced by the 3.7 million refugee children aged five to 18 who are currently out of school, according to a UNHCR report published on Friday. The vast majority are missing out on secondary school.The UN’s special envoy for global education, Gordon Brown, told the  that aid agencies needed to urgently address what he called the “human crisis” in education provision for refugees.He also called on all donor countries to step up with extra money during next month’s UN general assembly.The UN’s high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said greater investment in education programmes in host countries was necessary for refugees to be able to settle as adults in their current host communities or elsewhere.“We need to invest in refugee education or pay the price of a generation of children condemned to grow up unable to live independently, find work and be full contributors to their communities,” said Grandi.The report indicates that a number of countries have made significant progress in recent years, from Chad, Ethiopia and Uganda to Iran, Mexico and Pakistan. Giving refugees access to schools, making their timetables more flexible, and offering special help to catch up on missed schoolwork are just a few reasons why refugee school enrolment rates have jumped in the past year. Primary school and higher education enrolment have both increased two percentage points, while secondary school enrolment has gone up by one percentage point from last year, according to the report.Yet school enrolment is only half the battle for refugee children. Staying the course proves extremely hard as they get older. In Mahama refugee camp in Rwanda, the report says, only one in four refugees who started primary school made it to the end.Half of the world’s 25.9 million refugees are under 18, data shows, yet with so many missing out on education, the consequences on their communities and surrounding areas are likely to be far-reaching, said Justin van Fleet, president of global children’s charity Theirworld. Children in school are less likely to be involved in child labour or criminal activity, the report says, with girls less likely to be coerced into early marriage and pregnancy.“Investing in education for refugee and displaced children provides hope and opportunity to some of the most disadvantaged children and young people around the world,” said Fleet.“It is the solution to end the exploitation of girls, protect children from child labour, and create safer and more secure communities.”In Greece, more than three-quarters of the 4,656 school-aged children on the country’s islands who are asylum seekers and live in reception centres do not attend school. Missing documentation is one of the main barriers, preventing refugee children from being in school for their first year. Lack of funds are the most significant barrier for their second year, the report claims.“Roughly four out of five refugees are now living in protracted situations, which means that they’re living with the possibility that their entire childhoods could be spent in exile,” said UNHCR’s Matthew Saltmarsh.“If there is no possibility for them to receive an education or to advance in their education, that will have significant knock-on effects on those iniduals and their broader societies. Education ensures that refugees can become more self-reliant and more self-sustaining. To do that, they need to be able to work and live and move around and potentially integrate where they are. Education is absolutely crucial in achieving that.”Gordon Brown told the : “When the shocking gaps in refugee education provision mean that just three in 100 young people ever get to college or university, it is urgent that aid agencies act to deal with this human crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a67023f09dbb4f8f666eabb2d6d45b86aaa9791/287_0_1978_1187/master/1978.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dc40a993f6ab4e4f5e6e6e66bfd7f51","title":"is there a way out of the epstein mess prince andrew hasnt put his fat finger on it","story":"‘Sources close to’ the Duke of York have tried to cast doubt on his accuser by saying he has chubby digits. They’re going to have to do better than thatWho has the fattest fingers: Prince Andrew or the person who types his press releases? Without wishing to shock you, it’s possible that these two iniduals are sometimes the same person. Furthermore – and if your mind is already close to blowing, please look away now – it could be that the entities described as Prince Andrew’s “friends” in a sympathetic Evening Standard story on Wednesday are ALSO Prince Andrew himself. I know! He’s literally never worked harder. At the age of 59, he’s finally got a full-time job. Unfortunately, it’s convincing people he’s not a sex case.As you may know, Prince Andrew is currently what convention demands we style as “in the news for all the wrong reasons”. The story has long concerned his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who, at the time of his death in jail earlier this month, was awaiting trial for running an international underage sex-trafficking operation. It also concerns Virginia Giuffre (then Roberts), who alleges she was recruited as a child as Epstein’s sex slave, and on whose bare hip Prince Andrew’s hand is pictured in a now-infamous photograph. Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times when she was 17. He categorically denies this.But rather than Epstein’s apparent suicide making it all go away, the focus on the prince’s friendship with him, and its nature, has intensified. Some of Epstein’s private-jet logs, on which Prince Andrew’s name reportedly occurs several times, have been uncovered, while footage of the prince peering cagily round the door of Epstein’s New York mansion, some time after he was released from jail, has emerged. Last week, emails emerged in which a literary agent recounted seeing Andrew in said mansion, receiving a foot massage with Epstein, apparently from two well-dressed young Russian women. The duke was said to be complaining about public focus on his night-time activities.Perhaps troubled by the continuing inability to just make this shit go away, Buckingham Palace chose Saturday afternoon to put out a press release in which Andrew attempted to – what’s the euphemism?– clarify his position on a number of points. This turned out to be a curious document, different in layout from typical palace communications, and best described as a wildly disingenuous word salad. Milton it was not – although it did have the flavour of something proofread by him in his final years.Having been pored over, it was suspected by some royal watchers to be the work of Prince Andrew himself. Who can say? It wouldn’t be the first time, with the prince having occasional form for going over the heads of staff and issuing things himself. Either way, let’s take a look: “At no stage … did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.” The suggestion seems to be that a court-convicted sex offender needs to commit his crimes physically in front of Prince Andrew for the prince to suspect he might be guilty of them.Moving on: “I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know.” Without wishing to raise the tone by quoting Steven Seagal in Under Siege: what is this babbling bullshit? You knew he had been convicted of procuring a 14-year-old girl for prostitution and served jail time for it, in a case with huge amounts of supporting evidence and the testimony of more than 50 women telling similar stories. The rest – all the rest – is bullshit. Especially the bit about caring about the victims. You know the best way to look like you give one hundredth of a toss about the victims of sex cases? Don’t be friends with the sex case in question! Don’t stay with them in their mansions, don’t get foot massages with them, don’t get filmed looking surreptitiously round the front door as a procession of very young women come and go! It just looks … bad.As indicated, this stuff isn’t complicated. But even if it were, it’s important to remember that, unlike most people who pay their taxes to support him being helicoptered between golf courses, Prince Andrew has a dedicated team of people whose job it is to advise him which one of his friends is a weapons-grade scumbag. I’m vaguely paraphrasing the official palace job description here. But it doesn’t matter if we call them public relations experts, background vetters, wrong ’un sniffer-outers, or simply sentient humans over the age of 18 who can read. The royal family has got a team of them, who would have made these points about Epstein very, very clearly and very, very often.Anyway, back to this week. Surprisingly, Prince Andrew’s oddly timed, unprofessional-reading statement didn’t make all the shit go away, just as grinning sweatily in the car seat next to his mother on the drive to the church at Balmoral the previous weekend hadn’t made all the shit go away, either. Again, to fall back on another news cliche, the press release “raised more questions than it answered”.Yet worse was to come. On Tuesday, more than 20 of Epstein’s accusers gathered to testify before a judge in a Manhattan hearing. Outside the courthouse, Giuffre declared of the prince: “He knows what he’s done and he can attest to that. He knows exactly what he’s done – and I hope he comes clean about it.” Her lawyer added that he’d made “multiple” requests to Prince Andrew to “answer real questions”.Well now. This is the route that bring us to this Wednesday’s debut of the “chubby fingers” defence. Even as the rest of the media were obsessing over the breaking news that Boris Johnson was to ask the Queen to prorogue parliament, the Standard went with a splash headlined: “Prince Andrew hits back over ‘witch hunt’: Duke of York insists claims by Epstein’s ‘sex slave’ are ‘categorically untrue’.” Yup, a three-scarequote headline. Your basic fairytale.Right off the bat, we need to note the timing of this, coming as it did as most media outlets were understandably taken up with prorogation – a course of executive action so clearly batshit and messed-up that Courtney Love is boggling at it. (“I love your country. This is insane. Crying,” she tweeted later that day.) In short, Wednesday lunchtime was a very good time to bury bad news. You know what’s best dealt with under cover of a constitutional crisis? That’s right! A nonce-titutional crisis.And with that piece of kidding around, it feels wise to proceed straight to vehement ducal denials. As the Standard had it: “A source close to the Queen’s second son responded to accuser Virginia Roberts – who declared yesterday: ‘He knows exactly what he’s done’ – by saying: ‘Yes, he does know exactly what he’s done ... nothing.’” As this defender went on: “He is guilty only of showing misplaced loyalty to a friend.” Mmm. Is this a version of the classic job interviewee’s answer to the question “What’s your worst quality?” “I would say loyalty’”? Damn straight. If loving our friends is wrong, then which of us wants to be right?Anyway: fat fingers. One “source” cited the famous photo of Prince Andrew with Giuffre and opted to tell the Standard: “Look at his fingers in the photo. The duke has quite chubby fingers, they don’t look right and nor does the height of the duke and the girl.”Is this … is this really, honestly what they’re going with? Finger girth? If so: wow.It feels very late in the day to be pointing this out to Prince Andrew and his “close friends”, but he is a senior royal, on the civil list, and the allegations surrounding him and the close friend he knew was a convicted sex offender are of an order requiring something more than a finger girth theory. Until that is grasped, the search for something to make all this shit go away continues. Do consider this story as “developing”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5d57f555bc38bdae98567096d53d3a9cc738e3e/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=617c5e6bf03669b560bdec9869ff472e","title":"lana del rey norman fucking rockwell review","story":"Del Rey goes back to her well of swooning melodies, twanging guitars, Twin Peaks-ish Americana and cinematic ballads about women in love with ne’er-do-wellsWe live in a world of terrifying flux and instability, where any consideration of what might happen next comes with a side order of blind terror. If you were looking to understand the appeal of Lana Del Rey, eight years and five albums since her commercial breakthrough, you might alight on the fact that she offers a certain respite from uncertainty. You put her albums on and know more or less exactly what will happen next. There will be ballads decorated with cinematic orchestration. Guitars will twang and electronics will waft and surge in a manner that evokes Angelo Badalementi’s soundtrack to Twin Peaks, and her voice will be swathed in reverb in a manner that evokes Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star. The vocals will have a dead-eyed quality at odds with the yearning ache of the lyrics, in which girls will simper after brooding n’er-do-wells they invariably address as “baby”. A world will be conjured in which every woman is a weak, willing victim and every man an unmitigated tosser and dark intimations of sexual exploitation and violence will co-exist with a kind of 80s Athena poster version of dangerous masculinity: whatever the song, she will invariably sound like she’s singing to a monochrome Matt Dillon lookalike in a white vest, carrying a truck tyre against a desert backdrop, a cigarette dangling from his bruised lips.Naysayers quibble that essentially making the same album over and over again represents a failure of imagination: Del Rey wasn’t joking when she admitted she had “already said everything I wanted to say” after the release of her debut album in 2012. To her fans, however, she is the musical equivalent of a genre fiction novelist or short story writer whose work concentrates in one area. After all, no one ever complained that Raymond Chandler kept wanging on about seedy private eyes and bitchy platinum blondes.Norman Fucking Rockwell! offers evidence for the prosecution and the defence. The formula is intact. Everything proceeds at a glacial pace, strings swell cinematically, guitars twang Twin Peaks-ishly Del Rey and producer Jack Antonoff put the studio’s reverb unit through its paces, and we once more find ourselves in the presence of ladies saying things like, “I’ll make you real proud of your baby” and “If you hold me without hurting me you’ll be the first who ever did” to a new selection of unmitigated tossers: callous drug addicts, fly-by-nights, abusers, self-absorbed musicians, etc. “John met me by the training yard  Cuts on his face ’cause he fought too hard,” she sings on How to Disappear. “I love that man like no other,” she adds. You don’t say.And yet, as on Lust for Life (2017), which stirred a dollop of Trump-era apocalyptic dread into the mix, the formula is subject to subtle alterations. The action has moved to the neighbourhoods of Laurel and Topanga Canyons, and the lyrics are filled with references to music made by their celebrated late-60s denizens, from Mama Cass to Graham Nash to Joni Mitchell. A lot of its tracks open with solo piano before the strings crash in, in the manner of Neil Young’s A Man Needs a Maid. The protagonist of the title track is beset by the suspicion that her Matt Dillon-a-like may be a little too self-absorbed for his own good – “man-child … know-it-all” – which, by the standards of Del Rey’s universe, makes her Andrea Dworkin. She is capable of devising a scenario that sounds convincing rather than caricatured. California offers an impactful female perspective on the kind of crushed masculinity Bruce Springsteen writes about. And there is also the occasional hint that Del Rey may be writing not in deadly earnest but with tongue in cheek. Or at least you hope so: “If he’s a serial killer, what’s the worst that can happen to a girl that’s already hurt?” she sings on Happiness Is a Butterfly.Lyrics aside, the formula doesn’t preclude beautiful songwriting: beguiling, swooning melodies abound on Mariner’s Apartment Complex and Fuck It, I Love You. The disparity between a cover of Sublime’s lumpy Doin’ Time and the quality of the original tunes is unmistakable. Sometimes, the uniformity of mood and pace means that the subtlest production touches leap out: the coda of Cinnamon Girl, with its burst of EDM-ish electronics the distorted bass that fades in and out of Happiness Is a Butterfly the breaking glass and sirens buried deep in the mix of Next Best American Record. Elsewhere, the uniformity of tone and pace just sounds uniform, a state of affairs not much helped by the fact that a lot of the tracks feel over-long. The elegiac, end-of-summer mood of Venice Bitch sounds absolutely gorgeous, but it’s allowed to ramble on for 10 minutes, tricked out with guitar solos and extempore vocals.Listening to Norman Fucking Rockwell! is an alternately beguiling and frustrating experience.

It’s unfinished,” Miles Davis said in a revealing interview with the NME in 1985. “I like to find a place to leave for someone else to finish it. That’s where the high comes in.” As it undoubtedly would have when John Coltrane was reacting to the teasing daydreams curling from Davis’s trumpet-bell. But he never got to find that place with 1985’s pop-oriented Rubberband sessions, ditched after three months’ work by his new record label, Warner Bros. The tapes have finally been reinvented – 28 years after his death – by Davis’s drummer nephew Vince Wilburn Jr, and original producers Randy Hall and Attala Zane Giles. Vocal celebs Lalah Hathaway and Ledisi take the parts originally intended for Chaka Khan and Al Jarreau.As so often in this late period, Davis’s playing is beguiling in bursts. Rubberband of Life is a remake of the original title track – also present, with its scalding Mike Stern guitar break – and though the new mix’s promisingly D’Angelo-like vibe could valuably have been extended on the album, its polyphonic soul-vocal choruses are ethereally compelling as the delicate muted trumpet line picks its way through. Davis is quick and fluent on the PrinceJames Brownish Give It Up, Lalah Hathaway is powerful and precise on the neo-soulful So Emotional, and the ballad See I See – the standout, with its zigzagging runs and suspenseful pacing – glows with the pure-Miles light that this cut-and-paste job needs about twice as much of to really justify his name as its author. Rubberband is better than 1991’s Doo-Bop, the star’s final attempt at pop glamour (not least because it doesn’t include any clunky adulatory raps), but as a career-twilight curio it’s nothing like as interesting as its fusion-powered 1985 predecessor You’re Under Arrest, nor a memorable successor such as Marcus Miller’s thoughtful, compositionally integrated production of Amandla at the end of that decade.Game-changing German label ECM celebrates its 50th anniversary with live recordings from two fine Miles Davis-inspired trumpeters – Enrico Rava’s classy collaboration with American saxophonist Joe Lovano, titled Roma, and the ever-surprising Tom Harrell with former Bad Plus pianist Ethan Iverson on Common Practice.

EU citizens in the UK contacted the  in droves last week to demand clarification of their status as no deal looms.The Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan, who supported leave in the EU referendum, called on the home secretary to sort out the issues with the scheme, warning the government could end up with another Windrush scandal.The Portuguese woman who interrupted the broadcast spoke tearfully of having no voice in Brexit despite residing in the country for the past 20 years and said the “settlement scheme is not working”.The woman said: “I work and I gave this country my youth. I’m very grateful for what you taught me but you must make me part of all this process. I can’t just be kicked out. I build things for you, I’ve looked after your children. I’ve looked after the elderly in this country. Now you kick me out with what? With what?”She pointed at the Houses of Parliament and said: “I am very, very hurt by what they’ve done to England because I came here and I joined the working force and I’m very proud of it, and I’m very angry at them for doing this to this country.”She went on to say she had problems with her EU settlement scheme because her “national insurance didn’t correspond to the right thing” and said she was being forced to restart the entire process. “But the 31st of October is fast approaching. What am I going to do? How am I going to stay? What are my rights? I’m in the dark like many, many people.”Axel Antoni, a spokesman for the3million EU citizens’ campaigning group, said: “Our view of the settlement scheme hasn’t really changed. We’ve known from the beginning there would be issues with people proving their status.“We sent over 150 questions to the Home Office when it was originally planned and we never received any answers. What we’re seeing now is what we expected to see.”Antoni added it was not enough to just slightly tweak the scheme. “The answer to this is not changing the process, it’s about actually honouring the referendum process of making the settled status automatic.“The government could immediately solve the problem by securing our rights in law which was promised in the referendum campaign and Boris Johnson’s maiden speech. It would stop all these issues, including the likening to Windrush, by making the process about registration.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddac955aae2793d57fbd90b7c331e77842a0746d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb6cf118788a0dc20c7a037f81fe1525","title":"then and now what senior tories say about proroguing parliament","story":"A few weeks ago they were dead-set against, but now their positions are a lot less clear “Absolutely outrageous.” “Not a serious policy of a prime minister in the 21st century.” “A mad suggestion.”The idea of suspending parliament to force through Brexit provoked unequivocal condemnation from senior Conservatives just weeks ago, with ministers falling over themselves to express their horror.Now, after Boris Johnson moved to prorogue the Commons for five weeks ahead of the UK’s EU departure date of 31 October, his ministers’ once-steely opposition has turned to a more tight-lipped approach. hotfooted it to Whitehall in an attempt to get answers from ministers on their apparent U-turns, which follow on from strongly worded statements earlier in the summer.I’m a member of the cabinet, I fully support the prime minister” – ThursdayThe newly appointed secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, Nicky Morgan, told the BBC’s Question Time programme in June that proroguing parliament was “clearly a mad suggestion”.“You cannot say you are going to take back control … and then go: ‘Oh, by the way, we are just going to shut parliament down for a couple of months, so we are just going to drift out on a no deal,’” she said.But on Thursday morning, when the  spotted Morgan strolling past the gates of Downing Street, it was a different story.

Jude Brimble, the national secretary of the GMB Union’s manufacturing section, labelled the government’s approach “lastminute”.Unite’s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, condemned proroguing parliament, calling it an outrage and a silencing mechanism.Asked to clarify his position, Gove’s spokesman pointed the  to an interview he conducted with the BBC on Wednesday. Pressed on whether proroguing parliament was a political attempt to stop debate on Brexit and block MPs from preventing the country leaving the EU without a deal, Gove replied: “It’s certainly not. The prime minister is clear that he wants to use a new parliamentary session in order to ensure that the people’s priorities are met.

Still, at least she retained a laser-like focus on her day job.Asked about proroguing parliament, she replied: “I’m here on a visit to work out what’s going on in my department, how people are helping people into work. And what I’ve seen today has been really reassuring.” Asked again about the suspension of parliament as she got into a waiting car, she said: “I’m going to continue doing my job as secretary of state for work and pensions.” Her spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.You don’t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy” – 16 JuneThe chancellor, Sajid Javid, was also staunchly opposed to shutting down parliament during the Tory leadership campaign. “You don’t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy ... we are not selecting a dictator of our country,” he said. As the  surveilled the Treasury, Javid was nowhere to be seen to explain his position. Nor did his spokeswoman answer its questions. he also seemed to be absent from the airwaves.On the proroguing of parliament, a government spokesperson said: “We are currently in the longest parliamentary session in almost 400 years and it’s crucial that we put a bold and ambitious domestic programme to MPs so that we can deliver on people’s priorities across the country. To do this we need a Queen’s speech. This is about providing parliament with a new legislative programme that will help the NHS, fight crime, invest in infrastructure and cut the cost of living.“As we have said previously, prorogation to suspend parliament, to block MPs further consideration of Brexit is not something we support. MPs will sit next week, the week after, the week before EU council, and two weeks after. Not only that, but the government will put its entire domestic agenda, and inevitably its approach to Brexit, to the vote as part of the Queen’s speech, with major votes on 21 and 22 October.”Back outside the Cabinet Office, Brimble was furious about ministers’ change of tack. “They’re playing politics with people’s lives, they’re playing politics with people’s livelihoods,” she said. “They’re playing politics with the future of this country to appease the Brexiters in the Tory party.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24f27af7ff0547de85e10aa0903c065d71a9db7f/339_73_757_454/master/757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eed6cf00ced05bddf258814d200f335","title":"shetland byelection liberal democrats retain scottish parliament seat","story":"Beatrice Wishart elected as Lib Dems’ new MSP, beating high-profile SNP campaignThe Liberal Democrats have held on to win the Shetland byelection despite a high-profile SNP campaign to win the Holyrood constituency.Beatrice Wishart was elected as the new MSP for the area, succeeding Tavish Scott who resigned.He had held the seat since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999, but stood down in June to take on a new post with Scottish Rugby.Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP campaigned hard in a bid to win the seat, with the first minister visiting the islands on several occasions.But the Liberal Democrats held on, with Wishart now elected to Holyrood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/429dcb2bd2913cb9ebd8e6feb8c6e341be439a63/0_472_5306_3184/master/5306.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f35e81c31508e33f505985701421f627","title":"scientists quash idea of single gay gene","story":"Many genetic variants each play role in homosexual behaviour, study findsA vast new study has quashed the idea that a single “gay gene” exists, scientists say, instead finding homosexual behaviour is influenced by a multitude of genetic variants which each have a tiny effect.The researchers compare the situation to factors determining a person’s height, in which multiple genetic and environmental factors play roles. Writing in the journal Science, an international team of researchers report how they drew on existing genetic databases to conduct the largest study yet into genetics and same-sex sexual behaviour.Dr Brendan Zietsch, co-author of the research from the University of Queensland in Australia, said that does not mean the rest is due to upbringing or culture. “For example, it is thought that non-genetic factors before birth, such as the hormonal environment in the womb, also play an important role,” he told the .The team then looked at which genetic variants might be behind the link, using data from more than 400,000 participants in the UK Biobank project and more than 68,000 iniduals whose data was collected by the company 23andMe.Researchers found five genetic variants – tiny differences in DNA – that showed a clear link to same-sex sexual behaviour, two in both men and women, two found only in men and one found only in women. The team believe one, found only in men, might be involved in sex hormone regulation, not least because it is linked to male-pattern balding.Neale stressed that the scale of the influence of non-genetic factors, complexities of sexual behaviour, and difficulties in precisely measuring the size of any variant’s effects, means it is not possible to use genetic information to predict whether an inidual will have same-sex partners.The study provides a number of insights, including that there is overlap between genetic predisposition to same-sex sexual behaviour and traits such as openness to experience, as well as predisposition to mental health problems.“One possibility is that stigma associated with same-sex sexual behaviour causes or exacerbates mental health issues. This could create a genetic correlation,” said Zeitsch.The authors also say their findings call into question the idea that sexuality exists on a single scale.However, the study has limitations including that it is based mainly on people of European ancestry, while the age range of participants does not fully reflect that of the wider population. It also relied on self-reported behaviour.The idea that genetics might play a role in same-sex attraction was propelled into the spotlight in 1993 when Dean Hamer, a scientist at the US National Cancer Institute, and his team found links between DNA markers on the X chromosome and male sexual orientation.The findings caused considerable controversy, with the media dubbing the discovery the “gay gene”.Subsequent research has thrown up mixed results, although recent studies have supported the theory that genetics plays a role in sexual orientation.Hamer said he was delighted by the latest research. “This provides yet another strand of evidence, another approach, showing that there is a strong and significant genetic contribution to people’s sexual behaviour,” he said. However, unlike Hamer’s work, the latest study does not show any special importance of the X chromosome. The researchers say that is not surprising, adding the previous findings would not meet today’s bar for importance, and were based on a small sample size.Hamer said he was not surprised either – although he put it down to the latest study looking at same-sex behaviour rather than sexual orientation. Qazi Rahman, a leading authority on sexual orientation research from King’s College London, welcomed the study but said that the databases involved only captured information from a small percentage of people who were invited to participate. That, he said, means that the genetic variants found in the latest research might reflect another trait particular to those who chose to respond.Rahman added he was not surprised that the genetic variants identified only have small inidual effects, pointing out that since same-sex behaviour is linked to having to fewer offspring, evolution is likely to hide such variants in effect.A website set up by the researchers to explain the study gives a clear message: “This study provides further evidence that erse sexual behaviour is a natural part of overall human variation.”Rahman agreed, stressing that the findings do not change the fact that everyone should be treated with respect. “The causes of a trait shouldn’t influence how we see it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d006d4c403196cc797b5f6920f623f5e06e7a806/0_433_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd6c4897f74eccbe3cbc8c01274be6bc","title":"food bank supplies low demand surges school holidays","story":"Organisers say donations falling during the summer, just as more families seek helpFood banks in some of the UK’s poorest areas are running critically low on supplies because of a spike in demand during the school holidays.Organisers say more families are seeking help in the summer holidays than in previous years, yet donations are falling. Tricia Ryder, a distribution centre manager at Leeds North and West food bank, said: “We’re running critically low on supplies. The summer months are always the time when we get the least donations, but each summer we’re getting more and more attendants.”Ryder said there had been a drop in donations over the summer, which she believed was due to people being less financially secure.“A lot of the people who donate outside of the summer holidays are people that are then struggling themselves when their children are off,” she said.“It’s really difficult because there may be occasions where people are not getting their regular food parcel because we’re low on certain things.”Like many of the food banks the  spoke to, Leeds North and West, which has seven centres across the area, was short on items including long-life milk and juice, pasta sauce and tinned meat, fish, fruit and vegetables.Although national figures are yet to be calculated for the number of food parcels distributed to people in need this summer, many food banks have reported an increase.During July and August 2017, more than 204,525 three-day emergency supplies were provided by food banks, 73,226 of which went to children. In the two months before, 70,510 supplies were given to children.Foods banks in Preston, Leeds, Watford, Salford, Bradford, Newcastle, Merseyside, Nottingham and north-east Somerset were among those reporting food shortages during the school holidays this year.Andrew Tranter, 75, who runs Watford food bank, said while the shelves were usually well-stocked in winter – due to higher donations during the harvest festival and Christmas – supplies often dwindled in the summer months.He said there had been a year-on-year increase in demand for the food bank’s services. “Our stock in the last month was six tonnes, and we gave out seven-and-a-half tonnes. So far this month, we’ve received three tonnes of donations but given out three-and-a-half tonnes.”Many food banks are using online donations to stock up supplies, including at Waterloo food bank in Lambeth, south London.“This year we’re running a holiday programme for families, including hot lunches and breakfast some days, as well as activities and trips. Despite this, we are still seeing a lot of families at the food bank,” she added.The Trussell Trust’s chief executive, Emma Revie, said: “An increase in demand during the summer holidays can sometimes lead to a shortage in supplies. When this is the case, we urge the public to check with their local food bank to see what they might be short of as each food bank has its own unique needs.“An emergency food parcel, listening ear and compassionate, practical advice at the food bank can be the boost someone needs to break free from poverty. Any donations make a real difference.”With September’s harvest festival on the horizon, during which many schools across the country collect and donate items to food banks, most sites are expecting supplies to pick up over the winter.However, supplies are expected to be at their lowest in early September. “There will probably be even more families coming in during the last week of the holidays because of the additional costs of school uniform,” said Ryder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

The player most likely to make way would be Khawaja or Harris, meaning their partnership may also be a contest.Matthew Wade may also feel vulnerable despite his century at Edgbaston, surrounding it with four single-figure scores. He will bat behind Smith here, with the discarded opener, Cameron Bancroft, at No 6.“It’ll be somewhere in the top six, I can tell you that,” said the Test captain, Tim Paine, of the change. “We’re looking to have a squad that’s got some real depth and we want to get back to a stage in Australian cricket where we’ve got some really good players and unlucky players that are missing out.“Our selectors are going to have, hopefully after some big runs tomorrow, a really difficult decision to make.”The Derbyshire captain, Billy Godleman, chose to bat, unlike some county sides on recent tours who offer first use of placid pitches to make sure matches last the distance and gate receipts do not suffer. It almost worked, or would have done had anyone stayed with Leus du Plooy, second-last out for 86.Michael Neser, though, nicked two wickets before a run was scored, then came back to nip out Luis Reece after a recovery stand of 66. Alex Hughes and Harvey Hosein helped Du Plooy for a time, as he drove impressively through the covers.Once they were removed, courtesy of Labuschagne and Mitchell Marsh, Mitchell Starc shrugged off an indifferent day to grab three wickets in an over. Peter Siddle picked up Du Plooy in a typically parsimonious one for 11 from eight overs.Labuschagne and Bancroft went to the nets as Smith padded up but his only real work for the day had been the single, peculiar over he bowled before lunch: leg-breaks to the right-hander, off-breaks to the left-hander.

We were all concerned about the blood, instead of what’s happening underneath.”While concussions in major contact sports, notably American football, attract most of the research and media attention, traumatic head injuries in surfing are the shadow amid the sunshine – rarely discussed and poorly understood despite their potentially devastating effects.Studies suggest a significant minority of surfers suffer head injuries that carry a risk of cognitive decline in addition to the immediate danger of drowning.An analysis of surfing-related concussions on the west coast of Canada by Nikolaus Dean at the University of British Columbia in 2018 found that the sport’s culture “encouraged risk-taking behaviors and the denial and downplaying of the injury”. There is a reluctance to wear protective headgear, limited medical help and established protocols compared to major team sports and peer pressure to return to the waves without adequate recovery time.“The lifestyle is all happy, we’re at the beach, and the sponsors show that image,” Maidana says. “Nobody talks about concussions in surfing and nobody ever wants to talk about mental illness.”Another elite big-wave surfer, Shawn Dollar, set a world record in 2012 by paddling into a 61ft wave. He also competed at Nelscott Reef in 2014. The following year he smashed into a boulder while surfing in a remote location off the central Californian coast, breaking his neck in four places and suffering a concussion. He had to walk with assistance for a mile to reach his car and be driven to hospital.Bones healed but his brain is still a work in progress. “It looked like I’d played the equivalent of high school, college and professional football,” he says. “I’ve had a full recovery but I still am improving, honestly, I still have to take care of myself every day. I’m doing really, really well but it’s taken, like, three years and a lot of work.”He felt less mentally sharp after the blow. “I was kind of paying attention to what was going on in the news with the NFL and stuff like that but I was a little bit in denial about it, it just seemed crazy that I could be experiencing those type of things just from surfing. And there wasn’t any data out there but I was noticing that I was getting more foggy-headed and slower over time, it was affecting my well-being,” he says.Maidana returned to the water but eventually realized that she was “causing concussions over my concussions. Like a boxer’s brain, basically.” In dire need of money, with her medical care not covered by insurance, she tried delivering pizza and cleaning houses but was too unwell.To force herself away from the ocean she moved to Austin, Texas, and took a job in a cafe. “A doctor told me when I got to Austin, ‘you are an inch from a stroke’, if I kept surfing,” she says. “I removed myself from the island to heal to save my life.”At one point, when she did not maintain a strict healthy diet, she had suicidal thoughts. “It was like - just end it, just end it, just end it. A lot of it was the nostalgia of what I lost. ‘Life without big-wave surfing is nothing, look what your life was before, living at the beach, you were in Hawaii, now you’re in Austin, you’re a waitress, life sucks’, basically. And it was so scary.”“It was like a horror movie, so much time underwater, it was just so violent what was happening, the beating in my body and the lack of oxygen. I truly was one inch from dying. I really felt: OK, the next moment I’m going to be on the other side. It was OK, I was peaceful about it. In a way I wanted it to end because I was feeling really bad, I just wanted the peacefulness.”But she did not seek treatment: “I didn’t get hit, I’m breathing, that’s all I need,” she thought. Then the waves in Nelscott were higher than she expected.“That’s when the terror started to creep in, I was very nervous, very uncomfortable in the water. A 35ft wave, nowhere to go, that’s the moment where you have to ditch your board and e as much as you can, go under the wave. I freaked out, that’s when I think the PTSD came, I froze, I saw the wave and I just didn’t do anything and it just took me,“ she says.“It hits me underwater with the lip of the wave - imagine a 35ft wave bringing a 10ft board that’s like a table, into my forehead. I got hit, I felt a quick in-and-out, black stars, pulled my inflatable vest. When I went black, I was like, come back – because if you don’t come back right now, you go.”Daniel Amen, a doctor in California who has treated numerous surfers, including Maidana and Dollar, often finds they have frontal lobe brain injuries which affect judgment and impulse control.“The surfer of a 30ft wave has to be incredibly coordinated and make split-second decisions well, now they’re not quite so good and it means they’re more likely to get another concussion because in their heads they’re going ‘I can do this’ but their processor isn’t reacting as it should,” he says.Maidana hopes her experience will raise awareness of the perils of big-wave surfing. Dollar suspects a culture shift will be hard to achieve. “I don’t think helmets are going to make a difference, I think it’s about surfers being aware that when they take off on a giant close-out wave just for, like, a photo, they could suffer brain damage from that wipeout,” he says.“When I talk to the younger guys they’re aware of what I went through and they’re asking questions like how can they prevent it themselves, how can they take care of themselves, what have they got to do. At the end of the day they’re still all charging really hard and getting hurt constantly. There’s an awareness out there but there isn’t really a change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d709588b4c4b7173bd32e36af05796e74c462a2/0_201_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9fa641d63dc0075f11b519412219308","title":"talking horses winter festival king george ladbrokes jockey club kempton sale","story":"The King George VI Chase at Kempton Park, the highlight of the Christmas jumping programme, has a new sponsor after Ladbrokes agreed a five-year deal on Thursday to back the track’s two-day Winter Festival meeting. Hopes the deal could herald a more certain future for the course soon evaporated when the Jockey Club, which owns Kempton, confirmed its plans to sell the track for housing are unchanged.The King George has been won by many of the sport’s most famous names, including Arkle, Desert Orchid, Wayward Lad and Kauto Star. This year’s race is the intended target for Nicky Henderson’s outstanding chaser Altior, who is unbeaten in 19 starts over jumps but has yet to race beyond two and a quarter miles.Altior is the 7-2 favourite to win on Boxing Day, when victory in what is likely to be his first race over three miles would confirm his status as one of jumping’s all-time greats. He could yet prove to be one of the last champions to line up for a King George at Kempton as the result of a plan announced in January 2017 to sell the course to Redrow Homes, which plans to build up to 3,000 houses on the 230-acre site.The likelihood that Kempton would be closed appeared to recede in March 2018 when an assessment of Spelthorne council’s green belt land found Kempton was “strongly performing” in fulfilling the purposes of the green belt. Simon Bazalgette, who was widely seen as the architect of the scheme in his role as the Jockey Club’s chief executive, also stepped down earlier this year to take up a new role with the English Football League.Unless or until it is formally killed off, the scheme to develop the land – which is valued at £600m with planning permission – will remain in the planning process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33df8ace6f1792779dfaf58b992131b4bb6382b7/0_85_3351_2011/master/3351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a4117490b99fb44e528e0ddcece17e6","title":"coco gauff sets up clash with defending us open champion naomi osaka","story":"Cocomania is taking further hold of the US Open as it steers into Labor Day weekend – and there is no telling how bright the fireworks will get. American sensation Coco Gauff made it through a stiff test from Hungary’s Tímea Babos to win 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 on Thursday night before a rollicking crowd at Louis Armstrong Stadium that hung on every point.In doing so, she became the youngest player to make it past the second round at Flushing Meadows since Anna Kournikova in 1996 – and set the stage for her biggest challenge yet. The 15-year-old ingenue from Florida moved through into a Saturday showdown against world No 1 and defending US Open champion Naomi Osaka, a third-round blockbuster that will almost positively be staged under the lights at Arthur Ashe Stadium.“This is just the beginning, I promise,” Gauff said afterwards to the still-buzzing audience. And following a second straight exhibition of heat-seeking serves, exquisite shotmaking and veteran mettle belying her inexperience, who would doubt her?Gauff, a former junior No 1 whose grown-up ranking has soared 544 spots to 140th in the  of seven dizzying months, sprang from the gate far better than in Tuesday’s first-round win over Anastasia Potapova, breaking Babos three times in the opening set and pinning her back with a booming first serve that clocked as high as 118mph, a faster top speed than all but four women at this year’s tournament.But Babos, a qualifier ranked 112th in the world best known for her doubles prowess, settled into the match nicely in the second, patiently extending the rallies with flat groundstrokes from the baseline and relentlessly hammering Gauff’s forehand, which incredibly appears to be the only weakness in the teenager’s package. The Hungarian finally broke in the eighth game and consolidated immediately, winning 18 of the final 22 points of the second set to wrest the momentum heading into the decider.A hush fell over the packed stadium when Gauff fell behind 15-40 on her serve in the opening game of the third, only for the American to rattle off four straight points to escape with the hold. The quality only climbed from there as the players wowed the crowd with swashbuckling rallies that at times used every inch of the court.Babos continued to pound away at Gauff’s forehand side, but the American leaned into the challenge and began winning the longer exchanges she had buckled under in the second, drawing out points with shrewd defensive shotmaking and foot speed which already rates among the best on the tour. One nail-biting hold followed another deeper into the third as the crowd urged the American onward with chants of “Here we go, Coco, here we go!” and “Let’s go Coco!” that rang down from the upper deck of the 14,053-seat show court during changeovers.Then Babos, serving to stay in the tournament at 5-6, finally blinked with a series of misfires from the baseline to go match point down. When the Hungarian dumped a backhand into the net after two hours and 22 minutes, Gauff raised both arms skyward in triumph as Armstrong erupted in applause.No one who has been around tennis for very long wants to go too far too fast when it comes to Gauff, who entered Flushing Meadows on a current of breathless hype after her charmed Wimbledon run and has now earned more than $377,000 in prize money in her two grand slam main-draw appearances. The sport has seen too many child prodigies done in by the pressures of premature fame, even if those cautionary tales are less common today than in previous generations.But it’s clear there’s something happening out here in Queens – and whatever it may be will only get bigger on Saturday when the remarkably poised teenager steps into the world’s biggest tennis stadium against the top-seeded Osaka, who has been compromised by a knee injury that forced her to retire from a quarter-final match in Cincinnati less than two weeks ago.The two share a warm relationship: they have practiced together in the past and their families know each other. But one look at Gauff’s steely game face and extraordinary composure makes it clear that will have to be put aside on Saturday.“She’s an amazing player,” Gauff said. “She’s defending champion. She’s won two slams. She’s No 1. She’s only 21. We’re both pretty young. But I’m a little bit newer to the game. So I’m just curious to see how my game matches up against her. Obviously I want to win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

These 10 examples have become part of everyone’s lives Much has been said about building inclusivity into technology, processes and all aspects of life. But what you might not realise is that helping people with disabilities drove development of some of our most impressive technology, now mainstream and widely used. As Esther McVey, the then-secretary of state for work and pensions, argued at Microsoft Future Decoded 2018: “When technology is designed to be assistive, it can become technology for everyone.”From Segways to wearables, here are 10 examples of accessibility tech that has gone on to change everyone’s lives.CeefaxIt has been seven years since the BBC switched off Ceefax. The teletext service was adored by millions and became the port of call for checking football scores on Saturday afternoons. But Ceefax actually came about 38 years earlier by complete accident.In 1974, engineers at the BBC were exploring ways to provide deaf people with subtitles and discovered that the unused part of the 625-line television signal could be used to send messages and information – and thus Ceefax, or “see facts”, was born.Gesture recognitionPinch-to-zoom and three-finger swipes to the right and left are just a couple of the trackpad gestures Windows 10 laptop users will be familiar with.The company arguably responsible for bringing gesture recognition devices to the mass market was Fingerworks. One of its lead engineers, Wayne Westerman, was inspired by a temporary disability – a bout of tendonitis. He found that using touch-sensitive technology helped to relieve his symptoms and believed it would do the same for others.Speech-to-textThanks to the proliferation of smartphone technology, dictation and speech-to-text capabilities have seen a broad uptake in use.But before speech-to-text became universally popular for dictation purposes, it was helping people who are quadriplegic or those with conditions such as multiple sclerosis to carry out tasks on their computers using voice commands. Helping a large set of users take advantage of the technology has been made possible because of companies such as Microsoft. The tech giant has been focused on bringing the software to a broad audience for years, having released its first speech API in 1995. Now its speech-recognition software, Dictation, will interpret users’ spoken words in eight languages, including English, Spanish and Japanese, and is widely available across the Office suite.Text-to-speechFinding your way around an unfamiliar city in a vehicle and receiving real-time traffic updates while on the road wouldn’t be possible if it weren’t for voice-guided navigation – or, more specifically, speech synthesis.Screen readers are a rudimentary form of speech synthesis technology and Windows-Eyes has been a software of choice for people who are blind or visually impaired since the mid-1990s. It enables computer users to access the various programs of a Windows operating system by converting text into speech. The technology is advancing to such a degree AI is now helping visually impaired people identify everything from friends and family to menu items. Microsoft’s Seeing AI app analyses pictures as well as text and describes them out loud. So it’s not just tech to stop you from taking a wrong turn.Keyboard usabilityThe layout of the qwerty keyboard is so familiar, you can probably type without looking – that’s no coincidence.Keyboard usability can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Italian inventor Pellegrino Turri created a mechanical typing machine and what’s thought to be the first typewriter. According to history books, a close friend of his was losing their sight and he wanted to find a way to keep in contact without having to dictate to a scribe. In order to use the machine, they had to rely on their sense of touch.SegwaysThese two-wheeled electric vehicles are a preferred mode of transport for many enthusiastic tourists looking to see the most Instagrammable sites across a host of European cities. They’ve been so popular with tourists that they’ve actually had to be banned in parts of Barcelona and Prague.The earliest incarnation of the Segway wasn’t intended for the helmet-wearing hordes, however. After witnessing a wheelchair user struggling to mount a kerb, Dean Kamen came up with iBot – a self-balancing mobility system that uses gyroscopic techniques to negotiate steps and uneven surfaces.Self-driving vehiclesOwning a driverless car may once have been like a storyline from The Jetsons, but rapid advances in technology have made it a tangible reality.In 2012, Steve Mahan, who is legally blind, became the first person to be taken for a ride in a driverless vehicle on a public road. This highlights how people with disabilities are likely to be key beneficiaries of driverless vehicles, even if the technology wasn’t explicitly designed for them.Eye-gazingThe ability to track the gaze of your eyes is becoming popular among gamers, who in some instances are now able to integrate this into their favourite game-play scenarios. It is allowing greater and easier interaction with the gaming environment, for example changing the direction of the camera so users can “peer around a corner” without their character moving.But eye-gazing has nobler origins it was initially used by people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and locked-in syndrome to communicate. By simply looking at a screen, users were able to select words and construct sentences. Former NFL player Steve Gleason was the inspiration for Microsoft’s eye-control tech in 2014, when he challenged the company to develop a solution for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It went so well that three years later built-in eye-tracking support was added to Windows 10.WearablesWearable technology is changing how you can interact with the world around you, and it is even augmenting reality.Approximately 15 years before smart glasses went on sale to the public, neuroscientist Paul Bach-y-Rita developed a device to enable those who are blind to “see” with their tongue. Today, the technology is sold as BrainPort: a pair of glasses with a small camera attached. A wire transmits visual input from the camera to a piece that users place on their tongue – light is converted into electrical impulses that then stimulate the tongue instead of the retina, creating a tactile image that the person wearing the device can use to navigate their surroundings.Brain recordingSome of the latest wearable technology on the market offers to measure your brain activity and alert you when your concentration drops.Back in 2006, brain-recording devices were being developed for home use for people unable to move or speak. A cap wired with electrodes recording signals from the brain enabled the person wearing it to select choices on a screen simply by thinking about them.Clearly when technology is built with accessibility in mind, it ends up being beneficial to all. The powerful message that these 10 pieces of tech, and countless others that you will be using every day, convey is that accessibility shouldn’t be an afterthought. In fact disability is often a lens for innovation. This is Microsoft’s view, which – along with resell partner John Lewis \u0026amp Partners – is operating with a vision to empower everyone with its accessibility updates on Office 365 and Windows 10.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

It was 5am on a dull, Monday in London and we were about to embark on a journey that would take us, by train, all the way to Stockholm.We arrived in Brussels on the Eurostar in time for breakfast and, after dropping our luggage at the BXLroom Guesthouse (a converted factory in the Stalingrad area studio €150 a night), it was time for waffles from one of the many nearby street stalls – where a simple sugar waffle costs €1.We took in the Royal Arcade, lined with chocolate shops, the Grand Place, the Manneken Pis … and then moved swiftly on to the wonderful Choco-Story, the city’s chocolate museum (adult €9.50, 6-11 €6.50, under 6 free). The next morning we returned to Brussels Midi station to catch the train to Hamburg via Cologne. Two hours later, having had a brätwurst lunch at Cologne’s central station, we took the ICE train to Hamburg.The pink-chandeliered lobby of the Reichshof Hamburg hotel (junior suite €155) welcomed us like a vision from The Grand Budapest Hotel, with the bonus of a gin cafe over the road. We walked around Alster Lake, one of the city’s two manmade lakes, which was busy on a summer’s evening with dinghies and rowing crews. The children had hamburgers in Hamburg on their minds, though, so we headed to Otto’s.A long day of travel meant another morning railway station departure. This time the 9.30am to Copenhagen, via Puttgarden – where the train was loaded on to a hybrid ferry for a 50-minute trip across a narrow sound to Denmark. Once in Copenhagen, our gang boarded the high-speed X2000, crossed the Øresund bridge (made famous by TV series The Bridge) and, five hours later, we were at Stockholm’s Scandic 53 (superior room £160) – and ready for a good night’s sleep.As much as I wanted to linger over Stockholm’s scandi-design, we needed to get to Strömkajen, one of the city’s two ferry ports, where a boat would take us to Hästholmen, our island home for eight days.As Stockholm fell away, the scenery became one of rocky islands covered with pine forests. Sweden had long been a fairytale destination for me and now, sitting out on the sunny deck, gazing at red, Pippi Longstocking-esque houses that peeped out over wooden jetties, I had the sense of a dream coming true.After an hour the boat docked at Vaxholm, the capital of the archipelago. Most passengers disembarked here, to lunch at the famous Waxholms Hotell or visit the Vaxholm fortress, a granite mass of battlements. Then the ferry was off again the remaining passengers loaded with food and crates of beer and wine.There are around 30,000 islands, in the Stockholm archipelago: some just rocky outcrops nested by sea birds, others, such as Vaxholm and Möja, are thriving communities. The majority, though, provide weekend and summer homes – buzzing with motor boats and hot tubs until mid-October when, it goes quiet and dark.Finding a rental house on the archipelago from the UK wasn’t easy: there are so many islands and, to me, online information felt limited. We used Airbnb, where the houses ranged from summer palaces with their own jetties, saunas, boats and beaches, to rustic shacks that looked charming but offered little more than four wooden walls, a bed and an outdoor, composting toilet. There was, it seemed, something for everyone.The islands are ided into the inner, middle and outer archipelago. The inner ones are clustered around Vaxholm, where we were, and are essentially Stockholm’s version of England’s home counties while the middle is akin to the Lake District and the outer, more like the Scottish Highlands.Some islands, such as Skarpö, Rindö and, further south, Lidingö, are linked to the mainland by road bridges (and the road ferry). Others are car-free and reachable only by ferry or a small boat. Some of the islands, like Hästholmen, are privately owned, usually by a small consortium, while others, including Finnhamn and Grinda, are owned and maintained by The Archipelago Foundation – these are usually nature reserves. Our criteria was car-free but not too remote, accessible by public ferry and a house (with indoor plumbing) that fitted the picture I had in my head of the perfect Swedish cabin.Arriving at one of the ferry stops on Vikingsborg Brygga, we were met by our host, Carl. We followed him up to the house along a dirt track and through a coniferous forest, bouncing gently on the springy moss underfoot and breathing in the pine-scented air.Unpacking had to wait as we had two children desperate to leap into the water. It was a five-minute walk to a wooden jetty from which we could e into the Baltic. We took the plunge …The water was clear, cold and less salty than we’d expected due to the fresh water coming from hundreds of rivers. Being so well-oxygenated, the water is also dense with weed. I’m an experienced wild swimmer but even I took a while to get comfortable with the aquatic undergrowth. There were also some strong currents, despite there being no tide however, as long as you respect them and keep an eye on the shore, there’s little to be scared of here.Flying in the face of expectations, perhaps, there wasn’t a sauna with the cabin but there was a small bathing hut, and that’s where we warmed up, post-swim, with coffee and cinnamon buns.The trip turned out to be one of the healthiest we’ve ever taken. Alcohol was expensive and difficult to buy, so apart from a few canned G\u0026ampTs I had carted from the UK, we were booze-free. Every morning, I ran the 5km of tracks through the forest but although there were about 50 houses on the island, I usually only saw a red squirrel or sleepy spider.Breakfast meant porridge – Swedish supermarkets carry the widest range of oats I’ve ever seen – after which, on the first morning, Carl motor-boated us over to the Skärgårdens Kanotcenter, based on Resarö, a well-heeled, commuter island.It had been easy to book our two kayaks online and as we headed out to explore places only accessible by boat, we agreed this had been an excellent choice. We glided through the wind-ruffled waters to the Bogesund nature reserve, with its beavers and huge white eagles soaring overhead. We swam in small coves with tiny fish swarming around our feet, hiked through wildflower meadows and ate hotdogs and baked apples, cooked in designated firepits on beaches across the islands.The days were long – the sun didn’t set until 10pm – so we had time to take a trip out to Finnhamn, an island in the middle archipelago to eat giant raspberry and liquorice gelatos to host our own kraftskiva, a crayfish party, singing Lily the Pink because we didn’t know the words to the traditional Swedish songs. Without us noticing, the demand for phones and devices died away, leaving just the sound of the front door slamming as the girls headed out into the forest to pick blueberries, the gentle slap of paddles on the water and the splash of happy people wild swimming.• See our Interrailing guide to prices, passes and planning to work out which of the many passes works best for your trip.

Plus Spotify tries to turn us all into podcastersWYNC, the studio behind the likes of Radiolab and Snap Judgement, are launching an ambitious month-long podcast series aiming at bringing classical music to the masses. Hosted by former BBC Radio 3 presenter Clemency Burton Hill, The Open Ears Project will see likes of Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, and Call Your Girlfriend host Aminatou Sow reflect on how a piece of classical music changed their life. It all kicks off on 10 September.Spotify are hoping to turn its army of podcast listeners into podcasters themselves. A new button on the platform will encourage users to make their own podcasts by using Anchor, the podcast-creation app purchased by the streaming service in February. Spotify has stepped up its podcasting operation in recent months, buying major studio Gimlet Media, and launching a host of new shows.At the beginning of comic Sara Pascoe’s podcast about sex work, stripping and porn, she admits she doesn’t know enough about it. Which means she asks a lot of pertinent questions as she investigates further, hitting just the right tone. In the first episode, she talks to sex workers about human rights as well as gaining an insight into the amount of admin and marketing required to do their jobs. Her interview with social historian Hallie Rubenhold, ostensibly about Jack the Ripper’s crimes, is far-reaching and fascinating. Hannah VerdierGarbage’s Shirley Manson has produced seven podcasts where she talks with musicians “about the one song that changed everything”. It’s a varied cast, from Esperanza Spalding to Chromeo’s Dave 1. Along the way, she inspires Big Boi to do a Scottish accent and persuades Courtney Love to read out her lyrics, which Love says inevitably feature “some Kurt stuff”. Throughout it all Manson laughs, listens and is a delight of a host who never fawns. Start with Karen O talking about Maps. HVJessica Elgot and the  politics team reconvene a week early in a snap edition of the podcast that looks at Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s unprecedented decision to prorogue Parliament for five weeks from mid-September. Jessica and guests Rafael Behr, Owen Jones and Sonia Sodha look at what the move, which Speaker John Bercow called a ‘constitutional outrage’, will mean for Brexit negotiations.

The Reggie Yates podcast, which also features his friends Uzo, Owen and Baba, and the occasional guest, is a space where Yates doesn’t have to be as serious as he is in his documentaries, and finds himself bursting into fits of laughter in almost every episode. His experience as an interviewer means he manages to sway the conversation in a direction that results in an engaging discussion. But the best conversations are when they go off-topic, resulting in vulnerable and hilarious chats.

Representation on screen might not help disadvantaged or vulnerable groups achieve equal rights in any real way but it does help displace white, cis, straight and able bodies who have been seen as the universal human identity for too long.For many people – particularly marginalised people – seeing themselves reflected in pop culture can be deeply meaningful. For young people who are struggling to see their place in a world where they are markedly different from the “norm”, it can affirm their very existence. It can feel like hard, undeniable proof of personhood.Stone pitched the character herself last year, and has been developing the storyline alongside writers. This is worth celebrating, because while we’re seeing more and more trans characters on our screens, actual trans people have often been locked out of telling our own stories. From Hilary Swank portraying a trans man, Brandon Teena, in 1999’s Boys Don’t Cry, to Jeffrey Tambor’s tenure as a trans woman, Maura, on Transparent (up until his firing in early 2018), the idea that trans people should be the ones playing trans characters has been largely radical for the film and TV industry to accept.But that’s slowly shifted. The critically acclaimed US drama series Pose, for instance, is based in New York’s queer ballroom scene of the 80s and 90s, and its cast is made up predominantly of LGBTQ people of colour. Trans actors such as Indya Moore, MJ Rodrigeuz and Angelica Ross all play trans characters on the show, a step forward for the industry that’s been a long time coming.In Australia, across three decades, Neighbours has obtained a certain legacy status in the hearts and minds of many who grew up watching it. Arguably that makes it an ideal platform for inclusive storytelling, and Stone’s involvement isn’t the first time the show has presented viewers with progressive content. While Magda Szubanski officiated Australian TV’s first gay wedding last year on the show, back in 2004 Neighbours aired a much-publicised “lesbian kiss” by the characters Lana Crawford and Sky Mangel.According to an article in the Age, the onscreen pash was attacked by the usual corners for “making homosexuality look cool”. Newsflash to those squares: homosexuality is cool.Being trans is also pretty cool, I think, and having a trans person on a TV show with a reach like Neighbours is cool too.It’s hard to say exactly how much tangible progress on screen representation offers. As we’ve seen since the “boom” in trans visibility over the past five years or so, visibility and rights are not mutually inclusive.But at a time when politicians and publications (including, on occasion, the UK arm of this one) have made trans people’s – and in particular young trans people’s – existence a target for “debate”, there is some nice, uncomplicated good in a young trans person playing a young trans character on a beloved, long-running program.If longstanding viewers couldn’t think of a single trans person before, now they can.If a young trans person has never seen someone they could relate to onscreen, now they will.And to that one young person, it could mean an awful lot.• Mackenzie Hargraves comes to Neighbours on Thursday at 3.30pm in the UK, on Channel 5 and on Friday 30 August at 6.30pm in Australia, on 10 Peach"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3358e8ef33d5ab6bbe0a971593c573f53e479233/0_207_2559_1535/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2378fd9299a65893ee34d95877b4c08b","title":"hurricane dorian florida declares state of emergency","story":"Puerto Rico was spared, but storm is expected to land in Florida Sunday night, potentially as a category 4 hurricaneFlorida is bracing for the arrival of Hurricane Dorian with weather experts on Thursday proclaiming the state’s entire east coast at risk.A state of emergency has been declared and Donald Trump on Thursday canceled his forthcoming trip this weekend to Poland as the storm bears down. It was announced that the vice-president, Mike Pence, will travel to the eastern European nation in the president’s stead.Dorian could make landfall on Monday as a dangerous category 4 storm. Puerto Rico’s citizens breathed a sigh of relief earlier in the day at having avoided major damage from Hurricane Dorian, after it had been on a path this week to hit the US island territory directly.The latest computer modeling of Dorian’s path showed it arriving potentially as a category 3 hurricane or even as a powerful category 4 storm, on Florida’s east coast early on Monday, the Labor Day holiday in the US.The National Hurricane Center in Miami warned of dangerous storm surge and hurricane-force winds but said “it is too soon to determine where these hazards will occur”.Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, declared a state of emergency and urged residents to take precautionary measures including stockpiling water, canned food and other emergency supplies.“Dorian could be a major hurricane,” DeSantis tweeted. “All Floridians on the east coast should have seven days of supplies, prepare their homes and follow the track closely.”Georgia, another state potentially in the storm’s path, also declared a state of emergency for 12 counties nearest the state’s coastline.Governor Brian Kemp said the storm “has the potential to produce catastrophic impacts to citizens” throughout the south-east coastal region of the United States.One predicted track has the storm on course to hit Palm Beach county in southern Florida, the location of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. According to the Tampa Bay Times the president’s ocean-front property, often referred to as “the winter White House”, lies within the so called “cone of uncertainty”– the potential range of paths the hurricane could take.But a mix of weather factors currently affecting the region and the hurricane mean its exact path is highly unpredictable at this stage. Forecasters believe they will have a better idea of its size, speed and direction on Saturday when some atmospheric pressure systems have played out.Across much of Florida’s east coast, residents began flocking to the grocery stores and gas stations, stocking up in anticipation of the storm.There were lines at many gas stations in south Florida as people began filling gas cans and topping off their gas tanks. Some residents using community Facebook groups gave updates on new shipments of water to restock the nearly empty shelves at local grocery stores.Meanwhile the state’s largest power company, Florida Power and Light, said it had activated an emergency response plan in anticipation of the storm’s impact, securing around 13,000 employees and additional personnel to respond to damaged powerlines and equipment.DeSantis said he had spoken on the phone with Trump, who pledged support.“Hurricane Dorian looks like it will be hitting Florida late Sunday night,” Trump tweeted on Thursday morning. (The timing of the arrival of the hurricane was not settled and anyone in its path was advised to track the storm.) “Be prepared and please follow State and Federal instructions, it will be a very big Hurricane, perhaps one of the biggest!”The hurricane center advised that heavy rains from the storm were expected to occur over portions of the Bahamas, Florida, and elsewhere in the south-eastern US “later this week and into early next week”.With tens of thousands of Puerto Rican residents still living in temporary shelters after the devastation in 2017 from Hurricane Maria, which killed about 3,000 people and destroyed key infrastructure, the island had feared another devastating blow as Dorian bore down.But a calm day dawned on Thursday. “We’re happy because there are no damages to report,” Culebra’s mayor, William Solís, told the Associated Press.Several hundred customers were without power across Puerto Rico, said Angel Figueroa, president of a power workers’ union.Police said an 80-year-old man in the northern town of Bayamon died Wednesday after he fell trying to climb up to his roof to clear it of debris ahead of the storm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513ca8e106d007e2a2cb829a87bc77c938746997/0_220_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=405a6e3590d00836ed6026e4a3430896","title":"peru huanchaco sacrificial site skeletons","story":"Experts believe the children were sacrificed by the Chimú culture to appease the El Niño phenomenonArchaeologists excavating what is thought to be the world’s largest child sacrifice site have unearthed the skeletons of 227 young victims in the coastal desert of northern Peru.Teams have been digging since last year at the sacrificial site in Huanchaco, a beachside tourist town close to Trujillo, Peru’s third largest city.Experts believe the children, who were aged between four and 14, were sacrificed by the Chimú culture to placate the gods as rains and floods caused by the El Niño weather pattern battered the Peruvian coastline.“This is the biggest site where the remains of sacrificed children have been found,” chief archaeologist Feren Castillo told AFP on Tuesday. “There isn’t another like it anywhere else in the world.”He said the children had been sacrificed to appease the El Niño phenomenon and showed signs of being killed during wet weather.Castillo, an archaeologist at the National University of Trujillo, said that there may still be more to be found. “It’s uncontrollable, this thing with the children. Wherever you dig, there’s another one,” he added.The children’s remains were found in a position facing the sea. Some still had skin and hair and had been found with silver earrings.Huanchaco was a site where many child sacrifices took place during the time of the Chimú culture, whose apogee was between 1200 and 1400.Archaeologists first found children’s bodies at the dig site in the town’s Pampa la Cruz neighbourhood in June 2018, unearthing 56 skeletons.Pampa la Cruz is a short distance from Huanchaquito, where the remains of 140 sacrificed children and 200 llamas were found in April 2018.Excavation work at Huanchaquito started in 2011, but the findings were first published last year by National Geographic, which helped finance the investigation.Researchers there found footprints that had survived rain and erosion. The small footprints indicate the children were marched to their deaths from Chan Chan, an huge, ancient adobe city a mile from the burial site.The children’s skeletons contained lesions on their breastbones, which were probably made by a ceremonial knife. Dislocated ribcages suggest whoever was performing the sacrifices may have been trying to extract the children’s hearts.The Chimú civilisation extended along the Peruvian coast to Ecuador but disappeared in 1475 after it was conquered by the Inca empire, which in turn fell to the Spanish conquistadors.The region still suffers the devastating effects of El Niño.In March 2017, 67 people were killed and thousands more forced to evacuate by intense rains which damaged 115,000 homes and destroyed more than 100 bridges in Peru.In 1998, a “super” El Niño hit Peru, killing more than 300 people and causing billions of dollars of damage.AFP contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/262904f8ebd691a9c86bdd220ab66ce61bc0c9e0/0_0_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a8828414575abdc27b63207c3b89dd","title":"redesigned russian space suit lucky pee ritual astronauts","story":"Astronauts will no longer be able to urinate on bus that picks them up for launchRussia has unveiled a new space suit but the design may have to be changed to continue a decades-old tradition – making a stop to pee on the way to the launch.The Sokol-M prototype suit was designed as a replacement for suits worn during launches to the International Space Station (ISS) on Soyuz spacecraft.The Soyuz, in use since the 1960s, is to be phased out and replaced in the next few years with a new Russian ship called the Federation.The maker of the suits, the aerospace firm Zvezda, says they will be made of new materials and adaptable to different body sizes.But the new design makes it impossible to carry out one particular ritual launched by the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, who had to relieve himself on the back wheel of the bus that was taking him to the launch pad in 1961.The stop has been replicated at every launch from the Baikonur launch pad and, many male cosmonauts and astronauts pee on the tyre for good luck – something that would be impossible in the new suit, according to its maker.Female astronauts are not obligated to participate but some have brought vials of their urine to splash on the wheel instead.“I’m not sure how they will be able to (carry on the tradition), since we haven’t designed the fly,” said the Zvezda director, Sergei Pozdnyakov, quoted by Russian agencies. “We have the design specifications. They don’t state that it’s necessary to pee on the wheel. The design specifications would need to be adapted.”The orange Sokol-M suit has one diagonal zipper, rather than the currently used white Sokol-K, which has a V-shaped opening pointing to the crotch.The new suit is lighter due to the zipper and all seams are airtight, so there is no longer a need for the internal rubberised layer known as “the bladder”, which is difficult to get in and out of.All members of the ISS crew have to wear bespoke Sokol-K suits, since they must be worn on the Soyuz spacecraft that brings cosmonauts and astronauts to orbit.The suits are designed to be comfortable while reclining in the deep Soyuz chairs, but are heavy and contribute to a noticeable stoop when walking up to the rocket.Soyuz launches are full of rituals in which cosmonauts plant trees at Baikonur, get haircuts, watch the classic Soviet film White Sun of the Desert and have an Orthodox priest sprinkle holy water on them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de6896999a3b8a7d205f4d4ae2a203c86c878389/0_221_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7859851b20cc308db96a07ce4d60078c","title":"east timor indonesias invasion and the long road to independence","story":"The 1999 referendum came after 24 years of occupation by Indonesian forcesIn April 1974 a leftwing coup in Lisbon, the Carnation Revolution, led to Portugal setting its colonial outposts adrift. It withdrew its administrative and military personnel – including from Mozambique, Angola and what was then called Portuguese Timor.Local elections were held in East Timor and the two biggest parties – the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin) and the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) – formed a coalition, but it did not last long. Fighting broke out, there was an attempted coup by UDT, and then Fretilin unilaterally declared independence on 28 November 1975.Indonesian forces had already secretly begun attacks across the border from Indonesian West Timor (on the other side of the island) in October 1975, where five Australian journalists were killed in the town of Balibo. Jakarta feared a communist state on its doorstep and that a newly independent country in its sphere could destabilise the rest of the archipelago. It launched a full-scale invasion of Timor in December 1975.Portugal’s colonial influence meant the population was culturally very different from the rest of Indonesia. The vast majority of East Timorese are devout Catholics and speak their own language (Tetun).The Indonesian forces were brutal. As many as 200,000 people are thought to have perished in fighting, massacres and forced starvation. Fretilin and its armed wing, Falintil, retreated to the interior of the island with tens of thousands of civilians. It’s thought 100,000 died in the first few years, as the armed resistance was largely crushed and Indonesia held civilians in detention camps where many died in a famine. In July 1976 Indonesia’s parliament declared East Timor the country’s 27th province.Many countries, including Australia, effectively looked the other way, prepared to appease Indonesia because of its size and power in the region. In 1978 Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, was the first to recognise Jakarta’s de facto annexation. But the UN condemned it and called for an act of self-determination.In 1992 the head of the resistance, Xanana Gusmão, was captured and imprisoned in Jakarta. It was an almighty blow. The year before, leaked footage of the massacre of 100 mourners at a funeral at Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili had emerged, reminding the world of the brutality of the occupation. In 1996 the country’s de facto foreign affairs minister, José Ramos-Horta, was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace prize with Bishop Carlos Belo, the head of the Catholic church in Timor.In 1998 a political earthquake brought change to Indonesia. The Asian financial crisis and massive pro-democracy protests led to the resignation of the country’s strongman, President Suharto, who had been in power for more than 30 years and had authorised the invasion of Timor. Suharto’s successor, President BJ Habibe, was more open to some form of autonomy for East Timor, and released Gusmão from prison in Jakarta, into house arrest. In March 1999 Habibe announced that if, in a “process of consultation”, the East Timorese favoured independence over autonomy under Indonesia, he would grant it.On 20 September 1999 an Australian-led international peacekeeping force, Interfet, arrived to restore order.

An urban planner employed by the city of Cottbus, she now leads a team of 37 civil servants focused on regenerating the area.“Of course, everyone’s natural instinct is that they don’t like change,” she said. “But I think the attitudes of my generation of East Germans are different, especially among women. I sometimes feel we are like these amoeba that can always adjust to their surroundings.”But it is the voting intentions of many of the men left behind by the collapse of the coal industry that is likely to dominate Sunday’s regional elections, which could result in the rightwing populists Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) becoming the area’s largest party. Deindustrialisation has left a generation of men feeling emasculated, angry and open to the policy messages of the far right.With Germany moving toward phasing out coal power by 2038, the Cottbus area is facing the loss of a further 20,000 to 22,000 jobs directly and indirectly linked to the mining sector.In Brandenburg and Saxony, the AfD has realistic hopes of toppling the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD) and centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) as the strongest force.It has been forecast to triple its vote since 2014 in Cottbus, largely because the party has recalibrated its anti-immigration message toward railing against the government’s green agenda.“Coal is Lusatia’s last anchor,” said Marianne Spring-Räumschüssel, the AfD’s candidate for the region. “We need industry, because without industry there won’t be jobs in administration either.” Her party opposes the phase-out altogether, and she said she mistrusted the government’s promise to cushion job losses with €40bn in structural funds for hard-hit regions.“People in East Germany can read between the lines,” said Spring-Räumschüssel, whose party’s campaign slogan, Vollende die Wende – “complete the peaceful revolution” - controversially co-opts the language of the 1989 dissident movement. “We knew back then that those on the top weren’t being truthful with us, and now I’ve got a feeling that they aren’t being truthful with us either”.But Spring-Räumschüssel’s own story shows how some workers in declining industries have been able to adapt and thrive. Once a sales manager in the area’s other major industry, textiles, she benefited from several local grassroots initiatives aimed at building infrastructure for women to retrain and find a political voice. One such initiative set up was East Germany’s first all-female list of independent candidates, which kickstarted her career in politics.Although the AfD has the lowest proportion of female MPs among any party in the Bundestag and adheres to what she calls a “traditional image of the family”, Spring-Räumschüssel said her party still honoured women’s issues, largely through its stance on immigration.The 2015 refugee crisis, she said, had brought an influx of people into Germany who came from countries with “lower levels of education” and more traditional views of the role of women. “I am a woman’s libber through and through, you can see that. I don’t want to see my granddaughter become a housewife again.” When it comes to women’s rights, Spring-Räumschüssel said she did not “want us to be dragged back to the middle ages” by refugees.Other people who were also involved in projects intended to help women retrain following the collapse of the textile industry disagree with that negative portrayal of refugees. On Thiemstrasse, south of Cottbus’ central station, Hanka Lindner runs the “purple villa”, a women’s centre founded 30 years ago to offer support and retraining for former textile workers.“The centre has always been driven by the idea that we must not wallow in our misery,” said the 59-year-old. “When you are down in the dumps, you have to find a way out again.”There were increasing calls for a similar centre for the men left behind by the coal phase-out, said Lindner. “There is clearly an interest, but men can be their own worst enemy. They find it harder to support each other, and they only tend to seek professional help at the eleventh hour.”Cottbus’ purple villa has changed its focus in recent years to offer support networks for women among the roughly 4,000 refugees who have moved to the city since 2015. “In my experience, the conflicts between men and women you find in Syrian families are not that different to the ones we have in German families,” Lindner said.It was initially Syrian men who attended language courses offered in the city, but women were increasingly seeking advice, she said. “Many of them come to us because they want to work. The number of orces has gone up. And Syrian women are a lot keener on seeking a conversation with German women than men are.”Lindner said she was unsure what the rise of the AfD would mean for her centre. “In the last few weeks I have started to wonder myself what will happen to us,. I have never had to think twice about the political consequences of what I say. That’s a new experience for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/770d15df1681c065bf56bb103eeaa1af324b6485/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54c54fcf13b8566673b7162605f43df6","title":"joshua wong predicted hong kong crackdown","story":"Pro-democracy figure said protesters must keep up the fight or outcome will be ‘unimaginable’Joshua Wong was serving a prison sentence for his role in the 2014 “umbrella movement” when Hong Kong’s current protests broke out.The unprecedented outpouring of public anger had already forced Carrie Lam, the city’s chief executive, to announce that the bill was dead – and has kept the protests going. But as the movement enters its 13th weekend, Wong and Chow are among hundreds who have been arrested over the unrest.In an interview conducted before his arrest, the secretary general of pro-democracy group Demosistō said no one could have imagined such large-scale and enduring turmoil.He said: “They cannot govern Hong Kong any more. Five years ago, we said youngsters were standing on the frontlines and parents were criticising them. But baby boomers have been very supportive this time. People might not agree with all the behaviour of the protesters, but everyone is asking what’s the reason for teargas in residential areas, in roads where there aren’t even protesters?”He pointed to a poll showing that about four-fifths of the population want an independent inquiry into the police response to unrest – a key demand of the movement – and that almost as many want the government to completely withdraw the bill.He said: “Never in Hong Kong history have you had people supporting a political demand like that.”Wong said that while low wages and cramped housing had played a part in fomenting discontent, they were not driving the protests, with many professionals and wealthier people taking part, too. He said: “Everyone knows Hong Kong people are just asking for fundamental rights enjoyed by western countries since the last century.”Wong was a student leader who became the face of the 2014 movement and co-founded Demosistō. This time the protests are leaderless and he is just one face among many. Participants make their own decisions on the streets or via online voting.But arresting him and Chow, another leading figure in Demosistō, is a gamble. Protesters may well be intimidated by the cumulative effect of arrests, sackings and attacks by thugs. But many of the previous attempts to turn up the pressure have created further anger, and sustained mass participation.Wong said: “Mistakes by the riot police and Hong Kong government encourage people to continue this movement.”Protesters are under no illusions about the likelihood of retaliation once the movement is over, given what happened after 2014.Many believe authorities will crack down far more harshly if there is no sign of the movement dwindling. Mainland media have shown paramilitary police drills near the border with Hong Kong and there is growing talk that the government might invoke the emergency regulations ordinance, a colonial-era giving sweeping powers to the chief executive on everything from censorship to arrest and property seizures.Wong said: “I can’t imagine what would be the outcome. Of course they’re trying to scare people. But I think it also scares the world.He said he believed that international opinion was shifting, citing the recent joint statement from the G7 on Hong Kong, remarks from the UK’s foreign affairs select committee and growing political support among US politicians."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4001714.1567110473!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state to invest nearly 100m in five third level building projects","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA demographic bubble means student numbers in Ireland are forecast to grow by almost 40,000 over the next decade. File photograph: Alan BetsonThe The State is to contribute almost €100 million towards five higher-education building projects that look set to provide 14,000 additional places for third-level students.Minister for Education Joe McHugh will on Friday announce that some €96.6 million is to be invested by the Government to part-fund building projects at UCD, UCC, Maynooth University, NUI Galway and IT Sligo.The bulk of the remainder of the costs –- about €400 million – will be financed by institutions themselves through borrowing or private finance.Third-level institutions have warned in recent times that a crisis is looming in the sector due to underfunding and overcrowding.A demographic bubble means student numbers are projected to grow by almost 40,000 over the next decade.The schemes being backed through the Government’s Project Ireland 2040 plan include: €25 million for a technology society and innovation building at Maynooth €25 million for a business school at UCC €25 million for the future campus project at UCD €15 million for the learning-commons project at NUI Galway and €6.6 million for an extension to the central campus at IT Sligo. Mr McHugh said the developments would significantly enhance the capacity of the third-level sector to advance Ireland’s national and regional ambitions. “This will have a major positive impact on the sector’s ability to cater for significant increases in enrolments over the coming decade,” he said. However, the funding for these buildings is unlikely to ease anxiety within the higher-education sector over what it sees as the absence of a sustainable funding model.Mr McHugh recently ruled out a student loan scheme for the sector and also set out plans to freeze the student contribution fee over the coming years.The Government has not acted on the findings of the Cassells report, which warned that the current system of third-level funding would not match ambitions to make the State’s higher-education sector compete with the world’s best.Attracting private financeHowever, Mr McHugh said ambition was “at the heart of these plans” to fund the projects.“These projects and new buildings will have an important regional and national impact but they will also enhance the competitiveness of Ireland’s higher education system on the international stage,” he said.The move to part-finance such projects is part of a Government effort to leverage more private finance. Minister of State for Higher Education Mary Mitchell O’Connor said private finance played a critical role in the development of university campuses during a time of difficulty for the public finances. The Department of Education said five projects were selected following a detailed application and assessment process based on the capacity of the projects to deliver on national objectives.Maynooth University’s development should lead to an increase of some 3,000 student places, with enrolment growth focused on areas seen as essential to economic and societal development. The NUI Galway funding will go towards upgrading library facilities."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4001422.1567143452!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"special branch this is ireland s most popular tree","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Witch’s Yew in the Blarney Castle estate, Co Cork.A 600-year-old yew tree located in the grounds of Blarney Castle, Co Cork, has beaten off competition from trees in the Phoenix Park, the Battle of the Boyne Visitor Centre, Arbour Hill and at Castletown House in Co Kildare to win the Irish Tree of the Year Award.The winning tree, known as the Witch’s Yew, scooped 42 per cent of the public vote in a competition organised by the Tree Council of Ireland. The yew, which has long been a tourist attraction, is growing above the Witch’s Kitchen, a folly built by the Jeffreyes family in the 1750s as part of the Rock Close gardens in the Blarney Castle Estate.Legend has it that the area is the home of the Blarney Witch, who first told mortals of the Blarney Stone’s magic power of giving those who kiss it the gift of eloquence. The legend is that the witch, imprisoned by day in the Witch Stone, is released after nightfall, only to be banished to the witch stone again at dawn.Head gardener at Blarney Castle Adam Whitbourn says they are delighted that the Witch’s Yew has won the award.“It’s an amazing veteran tree with a fantastic story and that’s what the competition is all about. Personally, I’m happy to see specimen trees like this getting some recognition, especially in the current climate where such devastation is happening to woodlands around the world.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw for The For almost 80 years, Tony Broughan has been going to Dublin GAA matches he still goes to nearly every single game, following the team up and down the country. But it’s not just his devotion to the team that marks him out it might also be the dress.Since 1975, he has gone to Dublin football matches dressed as Molly Malone, and on Sunday, he will initiate a new member of the Broughan family into the tradition: his grandson Tighe, who will step out with his grandfather in Molly Malone garb for the first time. From Sunday, Tighe will carry on the family tradition alongside Tony.“I’m gonna die on the Hill,” Mr Broughan said last week. He still doesn’t have a ticket for Sunday’s game – and is still actively seeking one, but for his beloved Hill only. “The craic is great on the Hill 16. They’re always very good to me down on the Hill. They all sing Molly Malone when I go in, there’s a great buzz when I go down.”He has seen great Dublin teams come and go. He rates the teams of the 1950s and 1960s, which fielded brothers Lar and Des Foley, as among the best, alongside manager Kevin Heffernan’s “Heffo’s Army” of the 1970s.AspirationsHowever, despite the record-breaking aspirations of the current Dublin crop’s “drive for five”, Mr Broughan is modest in his praise. “They’re going well. So far so good. Only one more match hope they can do it,” he says.Tony Broughan took over duties as Molly Malone from his brother, Danny, who died in the mid 1970s, and has faithfully played his part since. He has lived for many years on Carnlough Road in Cabra West, where he raised eight children with his wife, Rose. In the same home, he cared for Rose in the last years of her life when she suffered with dementia. Before he retired, he worked with Dublin Corporation in the capital’s sewers, where he developed a reputation for being able to clear any blockage in the system.Tighe (11) may be eager to follow in his grandad’s steps as Molly Malone, but professionally he would prefer to be a livestreamer on YouTube than working below ground. Failing that, he has a fallback plan to be a teacher or a scientist. He counts himself lucky to have known only success as a Dublin fan and is now pleased to be able to continue the family tradition. “I’m happy to be able to do it for me granda,” he said.But is he worried about being slagged by his friends for wearing a dress to the match? “No, not really if me grandad got through it, I’ll get through it.”As for Sunday’s match, in Tony’s 80 years following Dublin, he’s learned to be sanguine about victory and defeat. “You win, you win. You lose, you lose. It’s only a match.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4002260.1567150172!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cork folk festival directors honoured for keeping festival going for 40 years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJim Walsh and William Hammond (centre in light blue shirts) have been organising the Cork Folk Festival on a voluntary basis over the last 40 years.

Four decades on, two of those who have been instrumental in keeping the Cork Folk Festival alive, festival co-directors, Jim Walsh and William ‘Hammy’ Hammond have been honoured for their efforts by being named Cork Persons of the Month for August.Cork Person Awards organiser, Manus O’Callaghan paid tribute to Jim Walsh and Hammy Hammond, pointing out that between them, the duo have been organising the festival on a voluntary basis for well over 40 years.“Thanks to the tireless work of Jim and Hammy, The Cork Folk Festival has become an integral part of our county’s culture. Their dedication to the festival embodies the Corkonian spirit, and allows Cork to compete with other folk festivals and events at an international level.”“The festival celebrates and showcases the indigenous music, song, dance and folklore of Cork, embracing the rich cultural heritage of the Muskerry Gaeltacht and Sliabh Luachra and, for a few days each year, transforms the city and county into a hub for folk and traditional music.”Jim Walsh thanked Mr O’Callaghan and others involved in the Cork Person Awards scheme for honouring Hammy and himself but said that it really was more a reflection of how important the Cork Folk Festival had become in the life of Cork city and county.“The Cork Folk Festival is one of the highlights of my social calendar, showcasing only the best of Irish and international talent and being recognised by this award is a clear indication of what our hard work and dedication to the festival means to the people of Cork. “Hammy Hammond recalled the origins of the festival when folk fan, Malachy Daly - who had been involved in running the Cork Folk Club in Douglas GAA club with the late Timmy the Brit McCarthy - returned from attending the Dublin Folk Festival in 1978.“The idea came from Malachy who came back from Dublin with the joys of all the great music and was talking to Tom Dineen who said ‘Why don’t you run one in Cork? so they spoke to Timmy, Jim Walsh, Noel Shine and others in the club and they pulled a programme together.”Hammy revealed that the template that they used for the 1979 Cork Folk Festival - headlined by De Danann - has stood the test of time ever since before revealing that this year’s festival will see many of the original artists from 1979 return to play the festival again.“It’s a sort of celebration - we have quite a lot who played at the first festival - Martin Carty was due to play the first but had to cry off when he got sick so Freddie White replaced him and both are appearing this year while we also have Arty McGlynn and Nollaig Casey, ” he said.“We have Jimmy Crowley who was there at the start - he’s teaming up with John Spillane - and we have Noel Shine with Greenshine, Mick Daly from the Lee Valley String Band, Ray Barron from Two Time Polka and Jackie Daly and Matt Crannitch who were also there that first year.“And we also have Andy Irvine who’s been a great friend to the festival over the years while we also Zoë Conway, Mairtín O’ Connor and Donal Lunny and Iarla Ó Lionáird from the Gloaming with Steve Cooney and Niall Toner and his band - we’ve about 200 musicians playing overall.”For further information on this year’s 40th Cork Folk Festival which runs from October 3rd to 6th, please visit www.corkfolkfestival"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4002265.1567152191!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nothing credible from british as backstop alternative says coveney","story":"Speaking at a meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers in Helsinki, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said that the UK government is yet to provide a credible alternative to the backstop.

Photograph: ERIC PIERMONTAFPGetty ImagesBoris Johnson’s Conservative government has put forward “nothing credible” as an alternative to Brexit, the Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said. Responding to a suggestion from Mr Johnson that the EU and the UK intensify negotiations in the run up to the October 31st deadline, Mr Coveney said the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is ready to negotiate five days a week if necessary. Mr Johnson has suggested negotiators should step up the tempo by meeting two days a week. Mr Coveney has repeatedly challenged the UK government to come up with technical solutions to the backstop designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. The backstop would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union and single market until a trade deal is negotiated between the UK and the EU. German chancellor Angela Merkel suggested a 30-day deadline for the UK government for credible alternatives – a challenge Mr Johnson accepted. “There is no country that wants a deal more than Ireland. We want good relations with the UK. We want to get a deal that manages a sensible Brexit,” Mr Coveney said in Helsinki before the start of a meeting of EU foreign ministers. “It cannot simply be this notion that we must have the backstop removed and we’ll solve this problem in the future negotiations, without any credible way of doing that. That’s not going to fly.“It has to be based on the Withdrawal Agreement and has to be consistent with it. They have to propose alteratives that will resolve that problem,” the Minister for Foreign Affairs said. “If there are alternatives to the backstop that do the same job, let us hear them. What we will not do in Ireland – and I believe there is strong solidarity across the EU about this – we will not allow a really important element of the Withdrawal Agreement to be removed, ie the backstop, and to replace that with something that does not stand up to scrutiny and is simply a promise that we will do our best to solve the problem, but not explain how.” Mr Coveney was also asked by reporters if he believed Mr Johnson’s controversial decision to prorogue the Westminister parliament would make it harder to reach a deal.

Photograph: VlietiStockIt’s undoubtedly going to be one of those “where were you?” moments. And already almost 10,000 people in the Netherlands have decided: on October 31st, irrespective of the weather, they’ll be at a giant beach party, facing across the North Sea, with a band playing We’ll Meet Again.The idea of a huge European “Bye, Bye Britain” party in Wijk aan Zee, a quiet seaside village west of Amsterdam best known for its annual chess tournament, started as a bit of a joke – until suddenly it went viral on Facebook. Now, says one of the organisers, film maker Ron Toekook, it’s caught the imagination. “Because so many Dutch people live in apartments, there’s a tradition here: you take your deck chair and a bottle of wine and go to the beach to watch the sun setting. Everyone does it. We love it.”The plan is for plenty of European food and drink – French wine, German beer, Dutch cheese, Belgian fries, Italian pasta, even Austrian strudel – to remind the Brits what they’re giving up, all to be consumed against a soundscape of nostalgic tunes from the previous Battle of Britain.“We’ll fall asleep to the sound of the waves,” says Toekook. “When we wake up, the UK will have cut itself off from the Continent, and we’ll be ready to go to the aid of the boats full of pro-Europeans.”If that seems a surprisingly unruffled way to mark a cross-channel parting that could hurt their economy badly – a no-deal Brexit could cost the Netherlands €34 billion up to 2030, or €164 a year per citizen, according to the research bureau SEO – that’s because the Dutch are even more uncertain about Brexit and its implications than the British and Irish are.Gains and lossesOn the one hand, they’re being told that Amsterdam, in particular, is “hoovering up” jobs – such as the 900 at the European Medicines Agency – at firms that are abandoning the UK and others that are opting not to go there. On the other, they’re being warned about the impact on the 200,000 Dutch jobs tied directly to trade with the UK.The problem is that both are true. As to the balance, the country is in “wait and see mode”, says deputy mayor of Amsterdam Udo Kock. And the figures? According to the Dutch foreign investment agency NFIA, 60 foreign companies and institutions brought about 2,500 Brexit-related jobs to the Netherlands in 2018, increasing the total number of Brexit-related companies Amsterdam has notched up so far to 98.Another 325 companies – “including some big names”, says the NFIA coyly – have made detailed inquiries that are being taken seriously.On the down side, the UK is the third biggest export destination for Dutch goods after Germany and Belgium, buying €40 billion worth every year, a huge 9.2 per cent of total overseas trade. A “hard” Brexit, with a reversion to WTO rules, would mean an increase of €628 million a year in administrative fees alone, say KPMG. At its starkest, according to the IMF, a no-deal Brexit would mean a drop of 0.7 per cent in Dutch GDP. Only Ireland with an eye-watering fall of four per cent would be worse affected.The biggest potential flashpoint will be Rotterdam, Europe’s largest port and the third-busiest in the world. It’s doing its best to plan. It has employed 300 more customs officers. It has cleared parking space for 200 trucks to minimise waiting time for new permits. Black boxBut while the terms of Britain’s departure remain in doubt, it’s impossible to model what will actually happen, only scenarios based on possible outcomes. “How things will work on the British side, in particular, is still a black box,” admits the port’s chief executive, Allard Castelein. In the end though, the figures are beside the point, says Dutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra, formerly a consultant with McKinsey – and he’s right.“In principle, Brexit is bad for the Netherlands, it’s bad for Europe and – I am certain – it will turn out bad for the UK as well. In fact, the only countries who’ll see it as a good thing geopolitically are China and Russia, because it will lead to a weaker, more ided, Europe.”It’s a sign of the times that one wonders for a second why Hoekstra didn’t mention the US and Donald Trump in the same breath as China and Russia – before remembering that America is the Netherlands’ sixth-largest trading partner.

Friends, family, you know the drill. \u0026nbspIt will lend up to £10,000 at an APR interest rate of just under 50 per cent.\u0026nbspBusiness was booming until quite recently, with a successful flotation at 275p, which made a billionaire of founder James Benamor and attracted some big name investors.\u0026nbspSince then, it has been a rocky ride. Before yesterday’s update, the shares were trading at less than half their near 300p peak. They’ve since halved again.\u0026nbspBritain will pay a big price for Boris Johnson’s Brexit coupA major reason for that is this sort of lending coming under the beady eye\u0026nbspof the Financial Conduct Authority.\u0026nbspThe regulator has voiced concerns about the growth of the market, the loans’ affordability, the high incidence of repeat loans lenders like Amigo have on their books.\u0026nbspHard-up borrowers can easily get into a cycle of borrowing, and then borrowing again, which sucks money out of already strained budgets.\u0026nbspThe watchdog also worries about whether guarantors really know what they’re getting into. They are themselves often of limited means. Becoming liable for a loved one’s loan repayments is a headache many of them could do without.\u0026nbspYou can see why investors initially got excited by the company. It currently has 210,000 customers. There could be 10 million of them in its sector. Amigo and its peers have created a market among them that barely existed before its emergence, one that has been booming. Whether that’s a good thing is open to debate.\u0026nbspThe problem with the “subprime” sector is that there is within it a substantial number of people who really shouldn’t be borrowing at all, who are inclined to take out loans to make ends meet rather than to fulfil a purpose (such as buying a car to get a better job). \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A notable feature of the results is an impairment ratio of more than\u0026nbsp30 per cent of revenues, up from 25.4 per cent and a deterioration of the proportion of loan balances fully up to date or less than 31 days overdue.\u0026nbspWhat can Britain learn from a Breton town’s bustling centre?Why the Bank of Mum and Dad is now a top 10 mortgage lenderM\u0026ampS faces ejection from the top tier of British businessIf that were so, why the need for a reset, which involves improving “credit and conduct policies” and prioritising new customers over relending to existing ones?The watchdog has already capped what payday lenders can charge. It followed up with a move on stores operating in the “rent to own” sector. The charges imposed on those whose bank accounts slip into the red via “unauthorised” overdrafts have similarly been addressed.\u0026nbsp“You can expect us to be consistent and predictable in our focus on affordability,” is what it has said on the subject of guarantor loans.

When universities were set up it was a space for predominately for white, middle-class men.\u0026nbspAn education system that was set up to advantage a particular group of people still exists to this day.”Jesutofunmi Odugbemi, Orapeleng Rammala and Wangui wa Kamonji, who are all of African descent, took the master’s course in 2017-18, where they say the majority of professors were white.The trio added that the course included a “disproportionately large number of cis-white male voices”.“The first class of our core African studies module began with how Europe has seen Africa historically, and only when we got to the final class of the module did students finally get a chance to consider how Africans have seen and see themselves,” the\u0026nbspletter says.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Meanwhile, prime minister Boris Johnson received a rating among students of minus 54 per cent, which is lower than Theresa May.Richard Brooks, one of the co-founders of anti-Brexit youth group For our\u0026nbspFuture\u0027s Sake (FFS), said the Labour party’s stance on Brexit and inaction over antisemitism were to blame for the fall.He said: “The continued confusion and fence-sitting on Brexit until recently has upset an incredibly pro-People\u0027s Vote and Remain young population. Even though Labour are now in a far better place, senior MPs in party continue to muddy the water without consequence.“It\u0027s also clear that the party\u0027s inability to properly tackle antisemitism has hurt it with young people, and it pains me as a party member to see our inaction in this area.”Mr Brooks said: “The Lib Dems and Greens have been crystal about their positions on the two great issues of the age – Brexit, in the form of supporting a People\u0027s Vote, and tackling the climate crisis.Tom Hazell, co-chair of the Young Greens, said: “All across the country, students and young people are rising up - from the climate strikes to opposition to Brexit. It’s the Green Party that has been showing clear leadership on the issues young people care about, while others are failing.”“The Greens remain the only party truly standing up for our generation - for those who want to stop the climate crisis, remain in the EU and reverse austerity,” he told The Independent.Dan\u0026nbspSchmeising, co-chair of the Young Liberals, said: Labour has let young people down by voting for a Tory Brexit time and time again, enabling the mess our country is in.We\u0027re committed to stopping Brexit. But we\u0027re also fighting to tackle the climate emergency, standing up for\u0026nbspLGBT+ rights and civil liberties, and proposing new ways to fix intergenerational inequality.\u0026nbspYoung people can see that, and they\u0027re joining us as the real progressive alternative.A Labour spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“In 2017 we won the biggest increase in Labour’s vote share since 1945 and took away the Tories’ majority. Whenever the next general election comes Labour will offer a real choice between a Conservative government run in the interests of the rich and the corporate elite, and a Labour government that abolishes tuition fees, invests in public services and tackles the climate emergency.“Labour is committed to a public vote, including an option to remain, and we are leading the campaign to stop Boris Johnson\u0027s devastating No Deal.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It included the words by innovation only and included all of the details about the event.But it was the image lurking behind the text that might offer the real clue about what\u0027s to come.The image is notably colourful: far more brightly coloured than Apple\u0027s usual invitation. It suggests, at the very least, that something particularly vibrant is on its way.But it might be a reference to something more specific.

That could further suggest that Apple is aiming for a nostalgic look in the new devices.Apple confirms when it will release new iPhoneThe different hues might also be a reference to the colours of the phones themselves. With the iPhone XR last year, Apple launched the new devices in a variety of different colours – and many of those colours are present in the image.There is, at the moment, no green iPhone. But, by coincidence, that colour has also been rumoured as the new one in Apple\u0027s upcoming line-up.Apple\u0027s event invitations are always picked through for clues about what is to come. Usually, they don\u0027t offer anything concrete – but can give an important indication of the kind of theme that Apple is aiming for in the new products or the event more generally.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The outside of those phones is thought to be largely similar to the current iPhone line-up, but they will have improved cameras and other internal hardware.The invitation appears to offer what might be a clue about the new phone. It features a colourful Apple logo, which recalls the old design of Apple\u0027s classic iMacs – and Apple has already been rumoured to be offering a nostalgic, rainbow-themed version of the iPhone this year.The phones will almost certainly arrive around a week and a half after the event. Previous release schedules suggest the phones could arrive around 20 September – and, for the first time, Apple is expected to release all three of them at once.As well as the iPhones, Apple could also reveal new Apple Watches, MacBooks, iPads\u0026nbspand other products. While a host of other products have been rumoured to be launching, nothing has been confirmed – and Apple occasionally pushes such other launches to another event in October, to ensure that the iPhone gets sufficient attention.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. Such a theme would echo West’s Sunday Service performance that he gave at Coachella in April.The list ends with the date 27 September, which is presumably when the album will be released.West’s most recent solo release,\u0026nbspYe, came out in\u0026nbsp2018.He has previously teased the release of an album titled\u0026nbspYandhi, but it has never debuted.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What those people need is genuinely affordable social homes.”While the 20 per cent reduction was not included in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government’s (MHCLG) statement, a spokesperson confirmed ministers were considering the proposals and said it would offer further details “in due course”.The proposals that were officially announced by the government on Wednesday morning were met with mixed reactions.More than 210,000 children homeless in England, finds reportCurrently, those using the shared ownership scheme can only purchase their home in increments of 10 per cent, which can be prohibitively expensive, costing up to £45,000 each.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailUnder new plans, pending consultation, people would be allowed to buy shares of\u0026nbsptheir house one per cent at a time.But critics warned administrative costs involved in purchasing further shares\u0026nbsp– such as legal, mortgage arrangement and\u0026nbspvaluation fees\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspcould render\u0026nbspthe proposal\u0026nbsp”unworkable”.The\u0026nbspMHCLG\u0026nbspsaid it wants to make buying smaller chunks a simple, quick process that bypasses the current costly and sometimes lengthy valuations system and will explore the best way to achieve this.Pedzai fears deportation back to Zimbabwe after almost five year waitMr Jenrick\u0027s department\u0026nbspalso announced it had closed a loophole allowing those using the Help to Buy scheme to take on a 35-year mortgage, which until ths week had been capped at 25 years.This would make mortgage payments more affordable but leave people with greater interest to pay off in the long run.Ms\u0026nbspNeate\u0026nbspinstead urged the government to “get building”.“Pinning his hopes on yet another complicated housing scheme is a worrying start for the new housing secretary,” she said.\u0026nbsp“The government must realise that unworkable schemes, laden down with admin costs, are the wrong priority at any time – and are woefully inadequate when this country is facing the current housing emergency.Homeless people denied access to basic healthcare, finds study“If the new government is serious about getting to grips with our housing crisis then it must follow through on its commitment to get building. That’s why we’re calling for 3 million more social homes over the next 20 years, to give more families the sort of step-up they actually need in life.”The MHCLG also plans to increase\u0026nbspthe number of homes sold at discounted prices to people trying to get onto the property ladder\u0026nbspand help\u0026nbspbuild local support for new developments, Wednesday’s statement said.But homeless\u0026nbspcharity\u0026nbspCentrepoint\u0026nbspsaid the proposed changes would “have little impact on the most vulnerable people in need of housing”.The number of people sleeping rough in England has\u0026nbspskyrocketed by 165 per cent in the last eight years, with a homeless person dying every 19 hours\u0026nbspin the UK, data from the Museum of Homelessness suggests.Centrepoint’s head of\u0026nbspmedia and\u0026nbsppublic\u0026nbspaffairs Paul Noblet said in light of increases in debt and the cost of rent, he welcomed any move by government to make home ownership more affordable.“However, for the homeless young people Centrepoint supports, home ownership is not always a realistic or practical option – so the proposed changes will have little impact on the most vulnerable people in need of housing,” he said.“To ensure that everyone can have a place to call home the government must ensure it focuses financial resources as much on increasing the supply of social housing as it does on home ownership.”Mr Jenrick, 37, described his first major policy announcement as “radical”, saying: “Building the houses this country needs is a central priority of this government.“We know that most people still want to own their own home, but for many the dream seems a remote one.\u0026nbspMy mission is to increase the number of homes that are being delivered and to get more young people and families onto the housing ladder, particularly those on lower incomes.“That’s why I am announcing radical changes to shared ownership so we can make it simpler and easier for tens of thousands trying to buy own their own home.”Homeless man dies and second fighting for life after ‘arson attack’Building more homes won’t solve UK housing crisis, new report arguesWhy has Brexit sparked a mini boom in the housing market? But Ms Neate suggested the government could learn from other countries to address the crisis.She referred to schemes in Norway, in which people pay into a housing cooperative rather than making payments on their inidual home to a housing association. This scheme negates some of the costs associated with purchasing new shares.The MHCLG proposals underline Mr\u0026nbspJohnson’s\u0026nbspdesire to shift from Theresa May’s focus on improving renters rights, to increase home ownership and give young people “a\u0026nbspstake in society, the ability to own at least a share of their home”.While Mr\u0026nbspJohnson has stated an intention to build 300,000 new homes a year and make use of brownfield sites – former industrial or commercial lots – none of Wednesday’s\u0026nbsppolicy proposals referred to the building of new\u0026nbsphouses.A spokesperson for Labour’s shadow minister for housing said if homes aren’t being built, it doesn’t matter how large\u0026nbspa proposed discount is.Shadow housing minister Sarah Jones said: “Tinkering with the details of shared ownership is meaningless when lack of investment from government means low cost homes for ownership simply aren’t getting built.\u0026nbspThe Tories have failed to deliver the low-cost homes we need to get people on the housing ladder.”Just one\u0026nbspper cent\u0026nbspof all homeowners have accessed shared ownership, while the number\u0026nbspof these and other low-cost homes being built each year has almost halved since its peak in 20078, when 200,000 new homes were built.However, director of policy and research at the National Housing Federation, Catherine Ryder, said: “We very much welcome the news that the government is looking at ways to make staircasing in shared ownership easier.\u0026nbsp“Shared ownership is the best route into home ownership for people who can’t afford to buy outright and housing associations, who built 14,000 shared ownership homes last year, are committed to working with the government to continue improving it.”The MHCLG has been contacted for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

If the gun is used for criminal activity, Thor will stop selling to that client.The company takes two weeks to produce  rles, which cost around £, each.To test them, each gun is fired  times as part of the companys “internal policy”, before it is wiped to remove fingerprints, packaged and sent to the client.Only three components are needed to make a bullet: the case, powder and projectile.Although making weapons is a vital part of their work the most important part is the paperwork, whichnot completed correctly could see Gretchen face serious consequences.She said: “We follow the rules. We can lose our licence or go to jail. It’s a federal offence. It could be  years per weaponpaperwork isn’t right.”During filming for the documentary, the terrorist attacks at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, which killed  people take place.Thor were in the midst of organising an order to a gun shop in New Zealand where the terrorists bought their firearms.Before the attacks, New Zealand gun laws meant anyone over  could own a gun. In the wake of the atrocities, Thor’s order was put on hold.Askedthe attack proves selling arms has dangerous repercussions, Payton says: “I don’t blame all car drivers for one drunk driver.

From next June, only those over-s on pension credit will be eligible for free TV licences — just one in five people.That means .million pensioners, including more than , service veterans, will have to find £. a yearthey want to continue watching television.To add insult to injury, the BBC then disclosed how much money it is paying its stars.Anti-Brexit activist and Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker is on £,,, Graham Norton is on £, and Claudia Winkleman is on £,.Lineker’s salary alone would pay for more than , TV licences.Asthat wasn’t bad enough, earlier this month the Beeb said it intends to spend £million on an advertising campaign to attract young viewers and listeners.That’s more than the annual budget of Radio .It’s particularly high, given that the BBC can advertise on its own TV channels and radio stations for free. Apparently, the money is going to be spent on targeting young people on social media.Are we really supposed to believe that the BBC cannot afford to pay for pensioners’ TV licences, but can fritter away £million on Facebook adverts There’s almost nothing Auntie won’t stoop to in its desperate pursuit of the “yoof” audience.It has earmarked £million to promote its new Sounds app — including spending £, to transform the London Eye into the “London Ear” — and poured money into a series of increasingly tawdry podcasts, such as Gemma Collins talking about her le, a reality-show round-up called Reality Tea, and Unexpected Fluids, in which teenagers tell embarrassing ­stories about when sex goes wrong.It’s all a far cry from Lord Reith’s mission to explain.No doubt the BBC is concerned about how few young people it manages to attract — and this manests itself in other ways, too, such as its massive investment in apps and podcasts and its extensive online coverage of ITV’s Love Island.Last year, Ofcom revealed that  to -year-olds are spending an average of an hour and  minutes per day consuming BBC content, which is about half the amount for all age groups.Even more worrying for the Corporation, one in eight young Brits consumes no BBC content at all. Why should they fork out £. for the licence fee, particularly as many of them will already be paying for subscription TV services The fundamental problem the Beeb faces is that consumers are becomingly increasingly accustomed to paying for the TV content they want to watch and resent having to pay a mandatory flat tax to a single provider.The equivalent would beeveryone who owns a phone, tablet or laptop had to pay £. for an “internet licence” to fund Apple’s iTunes, regardless of whether or not they use the service.It’s time to do away with the licence fee — for everyone, not just the over-s.That would mean stripping down the state-funded parts of the BBC to its core news and current affairs output and funding that out of general taxation.It should sell off its profitable private isions — such as BBC Studios, which has annual revenues of more than £billion — and plough the money into creating its own subscription service.With its global brand recognition and unrivalled back catalogue, not to mention its reputation for high-quality drama, the BBC could easily compete with commercial providers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.Promising to scrap the licence fee would surely be a vote-winner for Boris Johnson.What other election pledge would save nearly every British household £. a year No s, no buts. When it comes to renewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, it’s time to say: “No deal.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They seem to think it a great benefit to the country when conducted with the EU, but a route to national disastercarried out with any other country.The charge that anyone will be forced to eat chlorinated chicken or GM foods is, needless to say, a far bigger porky pie than anything Boris has said on the subject.It is far from certain that a Johnson Government, when engaged in trade talks with the US, will make the concessions allowing these products into UK markets, butit does, then UK shoppers will continue to have a choice.They will still be able to buy chicken produced in Britain or the EU, or they will be able to choose to eat American chicken.I certainly have no fear of eating chicken which has been washed in chlorine. The idea that it is “dangerous” has been thoroughly debunked. Each of us ingests far more chlorine through drinking water than we ever would do through eating US-produced chicken.As for GM foods, we already eat them, vegans especially. The EU allows imports of GM soyafor simple practical reasons. Most of it is grown in the Americas and too many growers there use GM seed for non-GM soya to be sold as a separate product.If we want free trade we are not going to achieve it just by persuading other countries to open their markets to us. No, we will have to make the concession of opening our markets to them too. But there is no reason to be frightened.True, there are some products which need to be banned from sale for genuine health and safety reasons. But most of the EU’s food product standards are really just a form of protectionism in disguise, dreamed up to block competition for European farmers.If we do post-Brexit trade deals with the US and other countries — and in the process do away with the EU’s protectionist tarfs and product standards — some UK producers would suffer.But others would prosper as they enjoyed access to new export markets. Overall, as is almost always the case when trade barriers are taken down, we would benefit. Strong industries would grow and consumers would enjoy greater choice and lower prices.Boris’s vision of a global British pork pie industry shows the dference between him and the political opponents who spent much of yesterday scheming over how to stop him taking Britain out of the EU.While his glass is half full, theirs is half empty.They are driven by a pathological fear of le outside the EU.It is not that they have any great enthusiasm for the EU. After all, I haven’t heard one of them make a convincing case why the EU is an institution to be admired. It is just that they have a lack of ambition for Britain and so cling to EU membership.After meeting for several hours yesterday, what did the likes of Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer and Jo Swinson come up with That they want to extend Article  yet further, to prolong yet again the endless drt which unsettled markets and put off investment.Fortunately, the public seems to have come to a very dferent conclusion.

called titanium dioxide - is often mixed into brighter colours such as blue, green and red.But the new study, from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facilityin Grenoble, France, found that it can cause the needle to erode and so tiny metal particles can enter the skin.Those particles then travel to the lymph nodes, which are small glands that store white blood cells - responsible for killing invading organisms.The researchers claim that the identication of these metals inside the pigment could explain why some people suffer bad reactions to tattoos.In , a study by New York University found that  per cent of people had reported suffering an adverse reaction to a tattoo.But until quite recently, experts had thought it was to do with the inks.Previous research had shown that there were metal nanoparticles in the lymph nodes of tattooed people.They ranged from  nanometres long, or as small as DNA molecule, to two micrometres long, which is about the size of a bacterium cell.Nanoparticles are considered more hazardous than larger particles because they have surface area per volume, which can cause a higher release of toxic chemicals.The European Chemicals Agencywarned back in  that some tattoo inks could be toxic, and has called for the banning of the potentially-deadly substances.The organisations report claims that the toxic ink could cause long-lasting skin problems, as well as increasing the risk of cancer.Other side effects include serious allergic reactions to the suspect ink and painful itching which can last for years.Red inks were described as the most dangerous, but blue, green and black inks also came under fire.The agency said: “Many reports show concerns for public health stemming from the composition of inks used for tattooing.“The most severe concerns are allergies caused by the substances in the inks and possible carcinogenic, mutagenic or reproductive toxic effects.”The team at the ESRF wanted to establish whether there was a link between the metal nanoparticles found in the lymph nodes of tattooed people.ESRF scientist Ines Schreiver, who co-authored the research, said: We were following up on our previous study, by trying to find the link between iron, chromium and nickel and the colouring of the inks.After studying several human tissue samples and finding metallic components, we realised that there must be something .Then we thought of testing the needle and that was our eureka moment.They began studying ink sample under an intense X-ray and found that when tattoo ink contains titanium dioxide, the needle can erode.The research, published in the journal Particle and Fibre Toxicology, found that it doesnt happen with carbon black ink, which is softer.Co-author Hiram Castillo added: There is more to tattoos than meet the eye.It is not only about the cleanliness of the parlour, the sterilisation of the equipment or even about the pigments.Now we find that the needle wear also has an impact in your body.These are long-term effects which can only be assessed in long-term epidemiological studies that monitor the health of thousands of people over decades."},{"url":null,"title":"parents 11 plus exam questions","story":"Over , parents took the test supplied by a tuition provider, but the average correct score for all five questions was around  percent.In the exam, s were asked to answer a range of questions on grammar, verbal reasoning, non-verbal reasoning, and mathematical reasoning.Weve revealed the tricky questions that some parents just couldnt get their heads around -

Nahid in Farsi means Venus.The satellite, which had Irans first foldable solar , was supposed to be in a low orbit around the Earth for some two-and-a-half months.The semi-official Mehr news agency quoted Jahromi on Aug.  as saying that the Nahid- was ready to be delivered to Irans Defense Ministry, signalling a launch date for the satellite likely loomed.Irans National Week of Government, during which Tehran often inaugurates new projects, began August .Earlier today, Irans Defence Minister General Amir Hatami told the state-run IRNA news agency that the countrys satellite activities were being done in a transparent way, responding to AP and other foreign media reporting on activity at the space centre.Iran has also pledged to breach the agreement until it receives the sanctions relief it says it is owed.The deal was an agreement between the Islamic Republic and a group of world powers aimed at scrapping the Middle Eastern countrys nuclear weapons programme.It saw Iran agree to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium by  per cent.Enriched uranium is a critical component for making nuclear weapons and in nuclear power stations and by curbing the amount Iran produce is a way to curb the number of weapons produced.As part of the agreement, Iran also agreed to only enrich their uranium up to . per cent over the next  years and they agreed to reduce their gas centruges for  years.Gas centruges are used to separate dferent types of uranium which allows specic types to then be used to manufacture nuclear weapons or generators.Iranian nuclear facilities were limited to a single facility with only first-generation centruges for  years and other nuclear facilities had to be converted into other use.In addition, they were barred from building any more heavy-water faculties - a type of nuclear reactor which uses heavy wateras a coolant to maintain temperatures in the reactor.Also under the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency was granted regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities to ensure Iran maintains the deal.If Iran abided by the deal it was promised relief from the US, European Union, and the United Nations Security Council on all nuclear-related economic sanctions.The agreement was reached on July , , and the world powers signed it in Vienna.Whenever activity and research bear successful results, we will announce the good news, Hatami said.Iran at times in the past hasnt acknowledged failed launches.The apparent attempt to launch the Nahid- comes after two failed satellite launches of the Payam and Doosti in January and February.A separate fire at the Imam Khomeini Space Centre in February also killed three researchers, authorities said at the time.I think it is certainly an image problem, said Michael Connell, an Iran analyst at the Arlington, Virginia-based nonprofit research organisation CNA.I think its going to embarrass the Iranian space agency. On the other hand though, getting a satellite into space ... takes time.Tehran also says it doesnt violate the UN as it only called upon Tehran not to conduct such tests.The tests have taken on new importance to the US amid the maximalist approach to Iran taken by President Donald Trumps administration.Tensions have been high between the countries since Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Irans nuclear deal over a year ago and imposed sanctions, including on Irans oil industry.Iran recently has begun to break the accord itself while trying to push Europe to help it sell oil abroad."},{"url":null,"title":"employees","story":"But sadly, not all of us are lucky enough to have understanding and considerate managers - some are just plain mean.From being forced to miss a funeral to being blamed for theft, people have shared their horrendous experiences with their employers."},{"url":null,"title":"airline boss sacked fatshaming british airways cabin crew branding unkempt","story":"Katarzyna Richter secretly snapped the workers on a flight and savaged their “double chin, rotten and uneven teeth”.The cabin crew operations director at LOT Polish Airlines shared her astonishing criticism on Facebook.She wrote: “Today, my attention was drawn to grooming and appearance of British Airways cabin crew members, unpolished shoes, holes in tights, too tight unorm, double chin, rotten and uneven teeth, messy hairstyle.”In her attack, during a flight from Gatwick to Poland, Ms Richter also suggested BA workers were slack with their duties.She added: “By the way I am curiousyou as a passenger judge cabin crew by the way they look ”Outraged airline staff hit back, lambasting Ms Richter for photographing crew and sharing images online without their permission.One BA worker told The Sun: “How dare this airline executive invite the public to assess the appearance of a rival carriers workers.

The Prime Minister announced he was going to reboot Parliament in September, slashing the time MPs have to debate and block his Brexit plan.Number  say they want to hold a Queen’s Speech to set out their raft of domestic policies, and insist the timing has nothing to do with Brexit. But Johnson leads a minority government - and every sitting day increases the chances of his Brexit plan being defeated by opponents in Parliament. And today Number  said Defence Secretary Ben Wallace misspoke when he was filmed in an unguarded moment apparently admitting the move was about Brexit after all. Mr Wallace was seen speaking to French Defence Minister Florence Parly moments before a meeting of European counterparts in Helsinki, in footage broadcast by the BBC.    Ms Parly reportedly asked Mr Wallace about the plan to ‘prorogue’ Parliament. “Parliament has been very good at saying what it doesn’t want,” he said. “But it has been awful at saying what it does want, that’s the reality.” He went on: “So you know, eventually any leader has to, you know, try.” “I don’t know what the outcome of it…” he said, bursting into laughter. “You know…politics.”    He went on to explain that the real reason it was necessary to shut down Parliament to get a Brexit plan through was because Johnson doesn’t have the majority he needs to stop it being blocked. “Our system is a winner takes all system,” he said. “If you win a parliamentary majority you control everything. You control the timetable. There is no written separation. So it’s…you pretty much are in command of the whole thing. “And we’ve suddenly found ourselves with no majority and a coalition, and that’s not easy for our system.” A Number  source said: “The Defence secretary misspoke and was not involved in discussions about the Queen’s speech. The Queen’s speech will allow us to set out an ambitious legislative programme to deliver on our domestic priorities such as tackling violent crime, investing in our health service and tackling the cost of living.” But SNP MP Joanna Cherry, who is leading a legal challenge to the shutdown, said the clip backed up her teamaposs claim.  She tweeted: I’ve drawn this admission to the attention of our legal team. Defence Secretary backs up what we contend - that prorogation of Parliament is for an improper purpose  therefore unlawful. Labour MP Wes Streeting said: Telling the truth is a disciplinary offence under Boris Johnson’s regime. And Independent Group for Change MP Chris Leslie said: The shabby pretence that closing Parliament is anything other than a device to thwart majority of MPs makes this constitutional abuse more insulting.If they’re going to use authoritarian powers, at least be honest about why! But maybe it’s the cover-up that will trip them up.

When one in five of our kids is dangerously obese, the loss of  playgrounds since  in England alone is a self-defeating Conservative ideology recklessly gambling with lives. No single answer exists to reverse the obesity epidemic but encouraging the young to be physically active is – as the vast majority of parents know – part of the solution. So closing the areas where mums, dads and carers take children to have fun is a dead-end policy which Labour would urgently reverse. Cuts year after year to local authority budgets, sucking billions of pounds out of communities, was always a political move rather than an economic necessity.

The Mirror visited to hear what voters think now. Patricia Mennin, , a retired civil servant from Newcastle, who voted Remain, said: “I think we are better off staying in. “I’d vote the same way again. I just think we are better as a group rather than on our own. “Boris Johnsonis doing it prorogation to stop people from preventing a no deal. “We are going to end up with a no deal and the prospect of that is scary.”  Andy Heppell , , a plumber from Durham, who voted Leave, said: “I’d vote the same way again, I think the country needs some change. “Boris is like Trump, he’s got a backbone. I think he is going to deliver Brexit . “If he says you are going to get an egg with your chips, you are going to get an egg with your chips. “I’m not fussedwe leave with a no-deal. The public have no control and Brexit has shown that.” Stuart McCabe , , a law student from Bedlington, Northumberland, who voted Leave, said: “I just feel the benefits of us being out are greater than they are for us being in and I would vote the same way again.  “People who say they don’t want a no-deal are just saying they don’t want Brexit. “Having a no-deal is not a condition of leaving the EU. I would be happy with a no-deal. “The way the MPs have handled Brexit is a complete drama. They’re acting like it’s a complete shock still, three years on.” Janice Greathead , , a teaching assistant from Ashington, who voted to leave the EU, said: “The way the MPs have handled it is terrible.    “They are disgusting. They have dragged it out for so long. “It’s like they are pushing people to change their minds. There’s been so much scaremongering on both sides. “I don’t think there should be another referendum before we leave. ButI had to vote again I would vote the same way - to vote us out of the EU.” Ellie Greathead , , an accountancy student of Northumbria University who was too young to vote in the referendum but would now vote to Remain, said: “I don’t see why we are suspending Parliament.  It’s like he’s forcing the Government into a no-deal. “He is not giving the Government a chance to sort it. “The public have just been left bewildered. No-one knows what is going to happen. It is just total confusion.” Esther Choudhury, , a nurse from Gateshead, who voted Remain, said: “Voting ‘in’ just made more sense economically. “I would definitely vote the same waywe were to vote again. “I want to like Boris Johnson but as Prime Minister, suspending Parliament was a bad move.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBoris Johnson has vowed to leave the EU on October  - with or without a Brexit deal. And Downing Street insiders now believe crashing out of the EU without a deal to be the most likely outcome on Halloween. MPs may try to block a no-deal Brexit by voting to bring down the government. But the Prime Minister attempted to thwart them by proroguing Parliament for more than a month. No Deal been talked about for years. Theresa May secured a deal which MPs then voted down three times the EU delayed the date of Brexit twice and now Boris Johnson will only accept a deal which strips out the Northern Ireland Backstop. But the whole time no-deal has been the backup plan - with Theresa May committing £billion or so, and Boris Johnson adding another £. billion to the cost.    That includes a huge advertising campaign - costing more than £, to encourage the public to prepare for a chaotic exit. So what does it actually mean in practical terms  If thereaposs no arrangement in time, weaposll lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and face the prospect of goods checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The government published  technical notices over  and  outlining the practical effects of no-deal - from driving licences to cats.    UK officials also unveiled aposday oneapos tarfs that would slap £, on the cost of a family car from the EU - but leave % of goods imports, including steel, tarf free. This could threaten struggling UK industries with a flood of cheap imports, but would also prevent searing price hikes that hit your wallet in the short term. Meanwhile ministers had , troops held at readiness, could call up Army reserves and declare martial law. Supermarkets and pharma giants were told to stockpile food and medicine. A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But businesses are not what whoaposve written this guide for. Instead we have tried to establish  ways no-deal Brexit will affect you, the reader and your everyday le.  What is a no-deal Brexit  No Deal is the default optionMPs, the EU and the UK government canapost agree a Brexit aposWithdrawal Agreementapos by the Brexit deadline . The current -page deal, on the table since November , would have ensured businesses arenapost cut off by continuing rules in a apostransition periodapos until December . However, it came at a cost - a aposbackstopapos that could trap the UK in an EU customs union from . That means MPs and Boris Johnson opposed it. Mr Johnson has vowed to re-open talks on the deal, including dumping the backstop, despite the EU refusing to do so. If that fails, it leads us to a no-deal Brexit. Leaving with no deal will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increasing the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal aposblack holesapos where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . After Boris Johnson took power, spending on no-deal preparations topped £billion. What is Boris Johnsonaposs plan for no-deal Brexit   Plan Ais to renegotiate Theresa Mayaposs original, -page Brexit deal and come out with a deal on October . Plan B is to leave with no deal, but get a standstill arrangement from November  onwards to prevent crippling new tarfs. Plan Cis to leave with no deal and no standstill arrangement. Experts say Plan B in particular is complete fantasy land. Boris Johnson claims he can use Article  of the General Agreement on Tarfs and Tradeto stop new tarfs springing up. This is called a managed no-deal - arranging lots of mini-deals to help smooth the path of leaving the EU. But GATT  says a plan and schedule must already be in place to form a customs union or free trade area, within a reasonableof time. That doesnapost include a no-deal Brexit . What does the governmentaposs financial watchdog say about no-deal Brexit  no-deal Brexit would trigger a year-long UK recession in just a few monthsapos time, the governmentaposs official spending watchdog predicted in July . The Office for Budget Responsibility said a recession would begin in the final three months of the UK leaves without agreement on October . The pound would drop in value instantly by % - while unemployment would rise by more than a quarter. GDP would fall % by the end of , around the same as the early s recession and a third of what was seen in the  financial crisis. In all no-deal would add about £billion a year to government borrowing from , the OBR said - or, put another way, £million a week. That in turn would hike the UKaposs net debt by % of GDP by March . Despite the drastic findings, OBR forecasters said their stress test was by no means a worst-case scenario.     ways no-deal Brexit could hit you NOTE: This information was gleaned mainly from government no-deal preparedness documents and advice over the last year. Some of these situations may be avoidedthere is a managed no-deal. . Martial law could be imposed with thousands of troops on standby  More than , troops are being held at readiness in case there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Army reserves are also legally able to be called upthere is civil unrest, while councils are braced for possible runs on banks, fuel and food. Local Resilience Forums are reporting back to Whitehall and expect several months of disruptionthere is no deal. The government has plans in case it needs to impose martial law - military law - and curfews to restore order. Cabinet minister Matt Hancock admitted the plans existed but insisted the government was not specically looking at martial law and it was not the focus of our attention. . You need to renew your passport early  At the moment, British citizens can enter aposSchengen areaapos countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  October  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers to renew any passports older than nine years and six months. . Usually this means renewing six months before your passport expires. Butyour passport had more than  yearsapos validity, youaposll have to renew earlier, because the extra months on top of  years donapost count. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. . Pet owners must visit the vet FOUR MONTHS before a holiday  There is a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners must visit a vet at least four months before taking their pet the EU. And because talks are ongoing, that means youaposd better book in now. The animal must have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days later, to prove the vaccination worked. Pet owners must then wait at least three months before visiting the vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts.  . KFC and other big names could run out of food - and water supplies could be affected  Food is being stockpiled forwe crash out of the EU without a deal, and ministers have promised an adequate supply.  But thataposs not the same as having the range of food we do now. Leaked plans in December warned Brits could have to y their diet.  And in January, big names KFC, Pret, Lidl, Co-Op, MS, Waitrose, Sainsburyaposs, Asda and McDonaldaposs signed a damning letter warning food supplies could run short because of disruptions to the supply chain. They wrote in a joint letter to MPs: Our ability to mitigate these risks is limited.   As prudent businesses we are stockpiling where possible, but all frozen and chilled storage is already being used and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK.  They added: Retailers typically store no more than two weeksapos inventory and it becomes dficult to restock storesthe supply chain is disrupted. Leaked preparations under the governmentaposs Operation Yellowhammer warned some fresh food stocks will be affected and hundreds of thousands of people will be hit by problems with water supply. While there will not be overall food shortages, a combination of factors “will reduce availability and choice and increase the price”. Poorest families would be worst hit and “there is a risk that panic buying will disrupt food supplies”. There is also a warning of a “failure in the chemicals supply chain” for water. “The likelihood of this is considered low, affecting hundreds of thousands of people. Urgent action may need to be taken to make sure people have access to clean water.” . You could lose your job  A string of firms have either moved jobs out of the UK or are threatening to do so in a no-deal situation. Airbus, which employs , people in the UK with around , more jobs in supply chains, warned it may move where. Car plants are moving forward standard shutdowns to be around Brexit in case there are supply chain issues. And critics fear new investment will not come the UKaposs way, hitting jobs in generations More jobs could be lost due to oil refineries shutting down according to the Operation Yellowhammer document . Petrol supplies could be hit, oil refineries could shut and , workers lose their jobs. Panic-buying could create shortages, such as those seen during the  fuel crisis. The briefing says: “Traffic disruption caused by border delays could affect fuel distribution in the local area, particularlytraffic queues in Kent block the Dartford Crossing, which would disrupt fuel supply in London and the South East. “Customer behaviour could lead to shortages in other parts of the country.” Strikes over job losses at refineries could unleash disruption for two weeks. . Your motorway commute faces becoming a lorry park  UPDATE: After the October extension was agreed, Highways England deactivated Operation Brock until further notice. You can find the latest updates here. Major motorways in the South of England are set for serious disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit. From aposearly apos the Mwill be closed as needed from junctions -, with a contraflow of both directions on the opposite side, so it can be used as a lorry parkthere is gridlock at Dover. A backup lorry park will be in place at Manston Airport. The M in Kent is also expected to be used as a holding area for lorries. And a similar fate could befall a -mile stretch of the M towards Southampton. The Treasuryaposs additional £. billion no-deal Brexit fund, announced in early August , includes more cash to improve transport infrastructure around the Kent coast. The leaked Operation Yellowhammer document also warned Lorries using Channel ports may not be ready for French customs checks. It says: “The lack of traders’ readiness combined with limited space in French ports to hold HGVs could reduce [traffic] flow rates to %-% of current levels within a day. “The worst disruption might continue for three months before flow rates rise to %-%, although disruption could continue for much longer. “The French might act to ensure some flow through the crossings. HGVs could face a maximum delay of one and a half to two and a half days to cross the border.” . Millions of plane tickets could be cancelled  UPDATE: In March  the EU and UK agreed in principle to an reciprocal arrangement which would keep planes in the air for a year after the original exit date of  March  even in a no deal scenario. Itaposs unclear whether this will now apply for a year after  October. The International Air Transport Associationwarn up to million plane tickets could be cancelledthere is no deal. Currently it is not known exactly which tickets could be hit, or how passengers would find outthey are at risk. The situation arose because in a aposno dealapos, there will be no automatic legal basis for flights between the EU and UK after pm on  March . Under a pact struck between the UK and EU in December, basic connectivity will be maintained for a -month periodthereaposs no-deal. But according to the IATA - which represents  airlines including British Airways - that only means maintaining the number of flights in . It does not allow an increase in services - yet tickets have already been sold based on a predicted increase. Talks are ongoing, but Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, previously warned flights could be groundedgoodwill fails. . Youaposll find it harder to drive in the EU  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you should get an International Driving Permit. The £. documents were due to be sold at , post offices from February. Before they were sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a aposgreen cardapos to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Up to a million Brits may be forced to take a new driving test  British people driving in Europe could be forced to take a new driving testthereaposs a no deal Brexit. Up to a million Brits living in Europe were told to replace their driving licence with a local permit immediately. Guidance issued by the Department for Transport said: If you are a UK licence holder living in the EU or EEA you should exchange your UK driving licence for a local EU driving licence before  March . From that date, in the event that there is no EU Exit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in the EU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there. . If youaposre an EU citizen, youaposll have fewer rights to stay in the UK  More than million EU citizens living in the UK will have less concrete rights to stay. Whether thereaposs a Brexit deal or not, EU citizens can stay in Britainthey register for settled status with the government. But the rules are stricter in a no-deal Brexit. In no-deal, only EU citizens arriving before October  can apply, not those arriving by December . The deadline to apply will be  December , instead of  June there is a Brexit deal. And family members will only be able to join settled EU citizens in the UK before  March . As for the other way round - major EU nations have inidually said theyaposll allow UK ex-pats to stay, but this could y by country. And the rules could become stricter, with Home Secretary Priti Patel working on a crackdown to take effect on Day One of a no-deal Brexit. . Pharmacies and hospitals could start rationing medicine  Pharmacists have requested special powers to ration medicinesthere is no Brexit deal Under plans by the Healthcare Distribution Association, they would have special powers to y doctorsapos prescriptions and offer something a drug is unavailable.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. Government and NHS chiefs have set up a war room called the aposOperational Response Centreapos and industry firms are creating six-week stockpiles of medicine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock chartered a plane to fly in short-shelf-le products, like isotopes for cancer treatment, from Maastricht. Insulin could also be stockpiled. Mr Hancock claimed heaposd become the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, after fitting out facilities for storage of the crucial drugs. NHS staff are being directed to urge patients not to stockpile medicines personally to avoid shortages throughout the system. The Operation Yellowhammer document warned: While some products can be stockpiled, others cannot because of short shelf lives. It will not be practical to stockpile six months’ supplies.” Three-quarters of drugs arrive via Folkestone and Dover, making them “particularly vulnerable to severe delays”. Medicines for diabetes, some leukaemia treatments and flu vaccinations must be transported under temperature controls. “Supply chains are also highly regulated and require transportation that meets strict Good Distribution Practices. This can include limits on transit times.” The leaked document also warned social care could be hit by rising inflation - leaving operators facing collapse within months. “The adult social care market is already fragile because of the declining financial viability of providers. “An increase in inflation after the UK’s EU exit would affect providers of adult social care through increasing staff and supply costs and might lead to failure within two-three months for smaller providers and four-six months for larger ones. “Intelligence will be gathered to prepare for effects on the sector, including closure of services and handing back of contracts that are not part of the normal market .” . Your mobile phone roaming charges may be hiked  Mobile roaming charges face an immediate hikethere is a no-deal Brexit, the government has confirmed. Tory ministers are revoking the EU law which guarantees UK citizens pay the same for using their phone on the Continent as they do at home. That will leave mobile phone firms free to hike costs whenever they like after the UK leaves. Guaranteed free roaming launched across the EU just  months ago - and meant big savings. But that guarantee will be scrappedthere is no deal, thanks to an obscure law laid before Parliament. . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar aposdisruptionapos  Eurostar services could be suspended in a worst-case no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnapost guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. The EU has agreed to keep permissions for services like the Channel Tunnel open for three monthsthere is no-deal, while a new agreement is negotiated. But there arenapost guarantees. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit.  Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now.  But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight.  “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note.  “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.”  . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statesthereaposs a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case no-deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelandaposs Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventhereaposs a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thataposs based anywhere in the EU. But in a no-deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. And the leaked Operation Yellowhammer document warns passengers travelling to and from the EU may face more immigration checks. “UK citizens travelling to and from the EU may be subject to increased immigration checks at border posts. This may lead to passenger delays at St Pancras, Channel Tunnel and Dover, where border controls are juxtaposed. “Depending on what plans EU member states put in place to cope with these increased checks, it is likely delays will occur for UK arrivals and departures at EU airports and ports. This could cause some disruption on transport services. Travellers may decide to use alternative routes.” . Youaposll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peopleaposs rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governmentaposs advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnapost result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a no-deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  October . . If youaposre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  October . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your everyday medicines and perfumes could become more expensive  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between £ and £,. They will also need an import export license, which costs £. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wonapost be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. And finally... your regular caviar parties are doomed!  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a no-deal Brexit.

An Everton foodbank organiser said people in Liverpool are living in aposabsolute squalorapos and warned that a no-deal Brexit could have an unimaginable impact on the service, the Liverpool Echo reports.

The father-of-four spoke to ITV during a special segment about poverty in Liverpool and how one in every three children live below the poverty line. A DWP spokesperson said children growing up in working households are five times less likely to be in relative poverty, But the Echo spoke to Gerard Woodhouse, general manager of L Community Centre who was also featured in the special report. Gerard said: Iaposm more than worried at the moment. Everything we do will be affected by a no-deal Brexit. Our food only lasts two weeks, weaposre constantly relying on donations and the council are under-funded as it is. To be honest, weaposre living on S*** Street.    He spoke about how the people he helps are the poorest of the poor and that they feel completely abandoned by London politicians. He said: Iaposm absolutely fed up of hearing the rubbish thataposs coming out of Westminster. I invite anyone from London to come to Liverpool and see how people are living. They are living in absolute squalor. Their homes have no furniture, no gas, no electricity and no hot water so you can imagine what the houses look like. People are having to cook a tin of donated beans from the food bank on a portable camping stove. But general manager at L, Gerard says Dominic isnapost even one of the worse cases.    He told the ECHO: His problems arenapost that severe in comparison with some of the people we help. We got a call for help the other day regarding a -year-old man who had fallen after a heart attack. When we arrived, we found his -year-old grandson was the only person looking after him and he had leukaemia. Thereaposs just too many people falling through the net. Gerard added : I canapost even imagine how weaposd copea no-deal Brexit went ahead. Director- general of the Confederation of British Industry, Carolyn Fairbairn predicted that a no deal would cost the North West £bn, which equates to double its health and education budgets combined.

Research by the Association of Play Industries, seen exclusively by the Mirror, shows % of parents of children with health issues feel the lack of outdoor play facilities has contributed to their children’s problems. Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Andrew Gwynne warned: “Unfortunately children are... paying the price for Tory cuts to local government funding. With far fewer playgrounds, it is little surprise our country is sadly experiencing a child obesity crisis.” More than % of children aged  to  in England are obese. Since , local authorities have closed  playgrounds in England alone. In , MPs warned the nation’s , parks and playgrounds were at “tipping point” as cuts have reduced spending on local services by more than a fth since .  They warned a decline would lead to “severe consequences” for public health. Despite this, on average, £million less each year is being spent on play provisions. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum said yesterday: “Closing parks is woeful short-term thinking. “When parks and playgrounds are cut, children are denied the freedom and space to run around, and the calories just stay on them. The more they are denied this freedom, the more likely they are to become obese.” Grandma-of-five Theresa Thomas, , of Weoley Castle, Birmingham said her council removed all the play equipment from her closest park.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA student not used to drinking alcohol drowned in a freezing lake on his campus after downing four Jagerbombs, an inquest heard. Daniel Williams was not a regular drinker and he usually the one helping others to find their way home whenthey had drunk a bit too much, the coroner heard. Tragically there was nobody to take the -year-old home on a night when he appeared like a zombie, having consumed two-and-half times the drink-drive limit at the University of Readingaposs student bar. Mr Williams, known to friends as Dan, attempted to make his way home alone through five inches of fresh snow in the early hours of January . He had become separated from his friends but in his drunken state he accidentally plunged into the icy waters of the Whiteknights lake in Reading, Berks, the coroner ruled.  He was found following an extensive police search, in which boat crews and dog units were sent out. Scores of officers struggled to break the thick ice on top of the lake, just hundreds of yards away from the student union block, so they could enter the chest-high water. The inquest heard that ironically, Daniel was a leguard. The temperature was -C when they waded through treacle-like silt, searching for the missing student. The search ended days later - on February  - when Danaposs body was found, face down with his lower body submerged in the water and his mobile phone and wallet still in his pockets, the inquest in Reading, Berks, heard.  Heidi Connor, Senior Coroner for Berkshire, told the inquest: It seems to me that the circumstances of Danaposs death are tragic but very clear. On the night of January , he went out with friends, doing what students do around the world: he was enjoying himself, drinking alcohol at the student club. He came late in le to alcohol. Drinking alcohol when you are not used to drinking alcohol can have a more dramatic effect, she said. The inquest heard evidence from William Collins, who was one of three other young men who lived with Daniel in their student lodgings near to the university. Mr Collins told the inquest how the four housemates had decided on a night out together on January  and had left their home at pm. He said Daniel, who was wearing a dark-coloured hooded top, had been with him in the Cheese Room, the main dance floor in the newly-refurbished sixty nightclub and bar during the weekly Wednesday Union night. Daniel had ordered four Jagerbombs, a mixture of Jagermeister and an energy drink, for himself, the inquest heard, before he disappeared.  Mr Collins said, in an interview given to police before Daniel was found: It is normal behaviour for Daniel to just go off and leave us during a night and he had done this several times before. We did not see him again. The second year computer sciences student, rom Sutton, Surrey, was later seen by another student, Rebecca Jones. She saw him standing near to the front of the dance floor in the Cheese Room and clinging onto a railing in front of the DJ. Ms Jones said: I saw he was very blank in his face, ashe was staring at us. It appeared ashe was a zombie andyou jumped at him he would not have moved. Nobody saw Daniel leave the student bar and by the evening of January , his housemates had become so concerned they contacted the police and reported him as missing. Detective Constable Andy Matheson, of Thames Valley Police, told the inquest police had upgraded Mr Williams to a high-risk missing person after failing to find him during an overnight search. He told the inquest police had established Mr Williams had left the student bar at .am, as his phone had disconnected from the unionaposs Wi-Fi network and his phone had stopped receiving any signal at .am.  Det. Con. Matheson said: I donapost think anything can be read into that as to when Dan entered the lake.The phone still ed when it came out of the lake. It is possible it [the phone] could still have been connected to the network while it was submerged in the water. Danielaposs parents organised a huge leaflet drop around the university area, appealing for any information about the whereabouts of the blond-haired, blue-eyed student. Volunteers from the local Lowland Search Team also took part in picking through bushes and undergrowth in the hope of finding Daniel and crews from the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service used their fire boat and waders to search in the lake, three times without success. Police Constable Al Mathieson, leading the search on the ground, said the conditions at the lake, which was not especially deep but was frozen solid and surrounded by a thick layer of silt, meant the focus of the search was on the bank of the lake. Mr Williams was found just shy of an island, which is about  metres from the bank of the lake and the inquest heard the joint investigations of the police and the coroneraposs office discovered there was no sign of any third party involvement, nor any indication that Daniel had been planning to take his own le.  Mrs Connor told his family, who attended the inquest, the young student had no drugs in his system but did have mg of alcohol per ml of blood, two-and-a-half times the drink-driving limit. The coroner said: He did have a relatively high blood alcohol level. In this line of work, I have seen worse than this, but it is undoubtedly high. A post mortem examination gave the cause of death as drowning while under the influence of alcohol and Mrs Connor suggested to the family Mr Williamsapos death should be ruled as an accident. In response, a woman believed to be Danielaposs mother, told the coroner: Contrary to the findings that he had the alcohol, ironically Dan wasnapost a drinker and I feel he was possibly rather naive. Two-and-a-half times the legal limit for driving is a lot, but as you say, there are people who drink a lot more. He did not drink at all until he was  years old. He was a wonderful son. He was genuine, principled, universally loved and liked by everyone who knew him.Ironically, he worked as a le guard. I feel it is tragic because I do not feel that his death should define him, because we are heartbroken.I just hope he did not suffer. Mrs Connor responded: I doubt there is one person in this room who has not been under the influence of alcohol at some point in their le. It certainly does not define Daniel in any way, shape or form.It is just so very sad that this was the outcome in Danaposs case.

The group, who are all Malaysian, are locked in a bitter deposit dispute and the flat in Dublinaposs city centre. Dublin City Council have sent a rapid response team after being alerted to the spot which is hidden behind a small garage door, reports Dublin Live. The door, which is the only fire exit, is around ft high with tenants having to crouch down low for access.    The aposapartmentapos has no vents, oven, or fan, and a hole in the kitchen ceiling thataposs covered by plastic is the only source of natural light. The students, three women and one man, say they signed a contract made by a man posing as the landlord and paid a €deposit last May. The contract started on May  and they stayed in two small twin rooms until August . The students allege the man, who is from China, wouldnapost allow them to cook anything other than instant noodles and instructed them to throw their rubbish in a nearby hotelaposs bins.    Despite requesting mattresses, they say they were given yellow sponge mats to sleep on. The former tenants also said the man walked into their rooms on a number of occasions in the night to confront them over household issues such as lights being left on or water on the bathroom floor. Two of the women allege that he made physical threats against them. One said: We were always afraid of what was going to happen next. When we moved in he told us he wasnapost going to live there, but then he gradually just started staying.    We were allowed to cook at the start, but then as it went on he started telling us we could only make instant noodles. One night someone left a light on in the common area and he came into our rooms in the middle of the night. He confronted one of the girls and started saying he was keeping her deposit because of the light being left on. Heaposd then say things like aposI know lots of people with lots of connectionsapos. He knows where I work and recently came in and started shouting at me and staff had to keep him away. Two of the women went to gardai on separate occasions but say they were told it was a matter for the Residential Tenancies Board. A spokesman said: We cannot comment on, confirm or deny details of inidual cases.  Typically the RTB are the statutory agency responsible for investigating such disputes, our role is to prevent breaches of the peace. The RTB declined to take on a case due to the landlord occupying the unit. They said: The RTB cannot get involvedthe tenant and landlord live together in the one dwelling. This living arrangement is often referred to as aposrent a roomapos scheme. The four claim they paid €each a month for two twin rooms while the man who acted as landlord, who they say told them wouldnapost be living there, ended up also living in with his partner. They say heaposs now holding €of their €deposit and has been constantly ringing one of the women in a bid to get € which he claims is owed to him. The dispute over the €allegedly came after one student left early without paying their last monthaposs cut of the rent instead telling the man to use their part of the deposit to cover.  The man acting as landlord allegedly told the other three former tenants he will not be giving them their cash back unless the one who left early pays him € . Fianna Fail spokesman for Housing, Darragh OaposBrien, blasted the situation and said he disagreed with the RTBaposs decision to shun the students. He said This is horric. And unfortunately itaposs not the first of these slum-like conditions that weaposve seen. This is the reality for some people when it comes to renting in Dublin. Places are really scarce at the moment and you will get a small portion of iniduals who think itaposs okay to rent what looks like a container.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now.

I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that.

The highlight is over the period, meeting and playing with some fantastic players.”And as he prepares to take them to Tannadice on Friday, that’s a message he’ll be passing on to the squad he’s in charge of now.“I think we’ve said from the start nothing will be won or lost just now, regardless of what happens in the match for either team.“Throw in Ayr United, Inverness and forgive meI’m missing others out but there will be a lot of teams challenging come March, April and into May. We want to be one of them.”That said, he does not hide how much he is looking forward to the biggest game of the season, so far, and, despite those mixed memories, it’s a fixture he relishes.“I’d say the highlight in a derby was here when we beat them -, I think for the first time in  years.“It was a big night for our fans because we were - up, they got back into the game but we got back in front.“It’s the goal that never gets spoken about, but it’s my favourite goal for Dundee, the header.“I know why everyone loved the one down therebecause we were - down with  minutes to go. It’s the nature of football.“Down there it was great because we were out the game so it felt like a win because we were - down with  minutes to go away from home.“But,it’s for a goal,I had to pick one of the two it was the one here.”Obviously, the injury three-and-half years ago was the low point, though, he is still able to look to the positive long-term outcome.“I look on the positive side. If that injury hadn’t happened I wouldn’t be leading a team down there this week.“I would have continued playing and I would have had some good times and some not so good times going through the later stages of my career.“Was it a blessing in disguise  Well I wouldn’t like to go through that again because it was a horric time for myself and my family but it helped me get a head start in coaching.”As for the injury itself, he admits he knew almost immediately how severe it was.“I’d had bad injuries before but nothing as shocking and as severe as that in terms of the reaction of people around it at the time.“I have to say, United were fantastic.

The adjacent Maritime House, which was once the home of travel firm DPL, is being converted into  new flats.No concrete plans for Custom House will be on the table until a new buyer for the property is found.However, the building could appeal to a property developer looking to create more homes in the area, rather than a rival hotelier."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.17939695-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.17939695-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.17939695-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.17939695-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"james mcpake accepts share of blame for dundee draw with inverness caley thistle","story":"Boss James McPake has accepted his share of the blame for Dundee’s below-par performance in Saturday’s goalless draw with Inverness Caley Thistle.After pushing Aberdeen all the way to extra time in the Betfred Cup six days earlier, the Dark Blues looked sluggish as they could not find a way past the Highlanders at Dens Park.While the gaffer was unhappy about that, for him, it was a case of collective responsibility that stretched beyond those on the park.“We’re inconsistent at the minute.

I’m chuffed,” he said.It’s all a far cry from where Charlie was  months ago when drinking four or five bottles of sugary drinks and alcohol and snacking in between meals was the norm. vw, px\"  Now he says he has switched to smaller portion sizes and is even eating some vegetarian foods.Speaking about Lighter Weighs, he said: “I enjoy the sociability.

Carole’s been brilliant. She’s just always helped me.”Carole said: “Charlie has done great. He just seems so much happier when you see him.”Talking about Lighter Weighs, Carole said: “We go back to basics – there is no fancy stuff.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d6640c902f1b2.65632836-854x564.jpg ","title":"what areas can the dark blues control in search for derby win","story":"Dundee head into Friday night’s first derby of the season unbeaten in the Championship and eyeing a chance to put a dent in Dundee United’s perfect start to the Championship campaign.Even this early, the Tangerines have put down a mark in Scotland’s second-tier title race and victory at Tannadice would give them a handy seven-point gap over their oldest rivals.For Dundee, they may have lost the Betfred Cup knockout tie with Aberdeen at Dens a week past Sunday but the performance against one of the country’s best sides has strengthened belief on the pitch and in the stands in James McPake’s side.So where can the Dark Blues win on Friday night Dons boss Derek McInnes hailed the front pairing of Kane Hemmings and Danny Johnson as Premiership quality and Dens gaffer James was more than happy to agree with him.He was quick to add in Andrew Nelson in that mix, too.Going with both Hemmings and Johnson up top would send a signal to the Tangerines’ backline they’ll have to be switched on for  minutes.As impressive as Robbie Neilson’s side have been this campaign, there have been some questions over the defence.Getting service into their strikers early on will be key as Dundee look to make things as uncomfortable as possible for Mark Reynolds and Mark Connolly.As experienced as those two are, Johnson and Hemmings on form will be very dficult to deal with.Johnson showed against Aberdeen that he can do the physical side of things when he battered Scott McKenna and Andrew Considine around while Hemmings’ pace and directness will complement that.Dundee United have an obvious threat – Lawrence Shankland has  goals in  Championship appearances, including  last campaign.He’s started le at Tannadice on fire and getting to grips with his movement will be vitalDundee are to get any sort of result.The Dark Blues rearguard, with Jordan McGhee and Jordon Forster the main men so far, has been pretty miserly this campaign with six clean sheets from their eight matches and only four goals conceded in nine under James McPake. Keeping that going will be job No  for the manager, a former central defender himself, especially with Shankland threatening to repeat his exceptional scoring record at the start of last season.However, the former Ayr man is not the only one to watch.On the flanks, Cammy Kerr and Jordan Marshall will have to keep tabs on Paul McMullan and Peter Pawlett. McMullan has been a key provider for United’s goals once more this season while former Aberdeen man Pawlett is just back from injury.Heading into the hostile atmosphere at Tannadice, with United fans taking up three sides of the stadium, the experience of players like Jamie Ness and Paul McGowan could be vital.Both have played at Ibrox and Parkhead in front of big, imposing crowds creating plenty of noise and, with teen sensation Fin Robertson likely to keep his place in the line-up, one or both of them may be needed to see the young lad through.Nothing has fazed the midfielder so far but a full house in a derby will be a whole new experience.Dundee have built a fairly young squad, meaning the likes of Forster, McGowan, Byrne, Ness and Hemmings may well make the dference."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"quot-weegie-birth-quot-andy-murray-greatest-glaswegian","story":"HE MAY be associated with everywhere from Dunblane to Wimbledon but Andy Murray was born in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"oscar-marzaroli-images-past-glasgow-life","story":"Kneeling in front of the old John Smithrsquos bookshop in Glasgowrsquos St Vincent Street is a boy.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

There is also a dedicated exam results section.Details of the local SDS centres are available at myworldofwork centres and information about events and opportunities is also available on Facebook.Pauline Graham, Project Manager for the SDS Exam Results HelplineSir,I had a great time at this year#s Islay Show. It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead golf club junior championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowCongratulations to Lochgilphead Golf Club junior champion , Kern McKellar and Euan Gilmour, who was the Stableford winner."},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

The means for  protection is the European Union PGIdesignation, to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.Ruth, an experienced journalist, explained: #I became concerned about two years ago when, during Japan EU Canadatrade talks, the UK government did not submit one PGI for protection.#Across Europe, , food names were protected. It worries me greatly.#She continued: #I am also concerned about how hard it is becoming to source local food and drink. I live in rural Angus, and the carrots grown down the road from me started le just as Angus carrots, but they went away for packaging and came back as Great British carrots. Technically that is correct, butwe believe in supporting local farmers and making clear choices about food miles and quality, this is ridiculous.#She stressed: #This is not a protectionist campaign. I welcome trade with any part of the world as long as the farm assured quality is there.##Keep Scotland the Brand is about valuing the integrity of our food and drink and recognising that Scotland is the brand. Across the world, people recognise Scotland as a quality brand.#One in five Scots is employed in the food and drink sector, so it is vitally important to keep our brand quality.#We trust the food on our shelves at the moment. Butthe trade deals being proposed go through we#ll end up with a multi-tiered system of quality. If the Americans get the trade deal they want, the high food standards we have are really only going to be accessible to those who can afford to pay.#It#s bad enough people having to go to food banks to survive, without people not knowing why their kids are getting ill.Ruth Watson is keen to emphasise that Keep Scotland the Brand is not a political campaign and it#s not about Brexit.#It is a campaign looking at the realities of what is before us,# she says. #I think that we have to look with some alarm at the trade deals that have been done. The UK government just has not protected our food brands.##I do this campaign on a voluntary basis from my kitchen table,# she went on. #Many people do not know what is coming. Food is treated as a commodity rather than something we should be grateful for every day, that is how successful our farmers have been.#I just believe thatfarming fails, my community is going under.##I#ve been talking to elected representatives, I go round shows. I#ll talk to anyone about this.#But what can ordinary people do Ruth is quite clear. #Get out there and talk to each other, spread the word on social media, speak to politicians.#But most of all support our local farmers.#"},{"url":null,"title":"get dancing get fit and have fun","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBack in April, the Mid Argyll branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society held a ‘Bring a Friend’ evening.The result was a super evening of dancing and laughter, not to mention some delicious home baking at half time, and the branch was delighted at the number of people who came along.Now the dancing season is starting again after the summer break and the members are hoping to welcome those friends – and others – to their regular Monday evening classes.Scottish Country Dancing is a really great way to stay physically and mentally fit while having a lot of fun and listening to some lovely music at the same time.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"ardbeg bullock winner at islay cattle sale","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowUnited Auctions held its annual show and sale of autumn-born suckled calves at Islay Auction Mart on Friday August .A good show of calves was presented to show judge J Taylor, Easter Octhtermuthil.Winners were: Bullock class:  Ardbeg,  Kilchiaran,  Ardbeg Heer class:  and  Ardbeg Champion calf: Ardbeg bullock which takes the William A Low Trophy Reserve champion: Kilchiaran bullock.Overall, the bullocks sold to an average of £ per head or .p per kilo while the heers levelled out at £ per head or p per kilo.Principal lots and prices: Bullocks: AAx: £ and £– Ballimartin.

headquarters.Members of the union Unite are striking due to changes to their employment terms and conditions.Road workers descended on the local authority on the morning of Thursday August , to coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bat-population-given-manicures-numbers-can-counted","story":"A group of one of the worldrsquos rarest bats is being treated topampering

The overall revenue budget for the upkeep of parks across the Borders is contained within the budget for neighbourhood services and no savings are projected from this budget as a result of the play programme.ldquoThe removal of old play equipment from playparks, which following appraisal, deemedto be low value facilities, will allow for sufficient resources to be deployed to maintain thenew facilities being invested in by the council through the outdoor community spacescapital project on an ongoing basis.ldquoThe new facilities include more pieces of equipment, widening access and providinghigher play value than the previous, aged, low-amenity, play equipment. Thedecommissioning of the older low value facilities will ensure the revenue impact to the parks and environment service budget is cost neutral.ldquoI would further confirm that no play park will be decommissioned until such times as thenew play park investment in that locality is complete.ldquoMembers should also note that no town or village which currently has a play park will beleft without one following the upgrade process.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson also queried the council leader, asking for an update on the proposed closure of eleven parks in her ward.Councillor Haslam told the chamber: ldquoThe council requested feedback to the programme for decommissioning of play parks with an end date of August .ldquoOfficers will now undertake a review of the feedback and, where appropriate, respond prior to implementing the council decision.ldquoIn announcing a signicant investment in outdoor community facilities the council recognised the need to address the historic over provision of low value playparks, indeed the council is in amongst the largest providers of play parks per  head of population when compared to similar authorities, however when it comes to quality it is amongst the lowest in play value terms.ldquoThe council decision to invest in destination playparks and decommission those play parks which are obsolete does not remove the spaces from fulfilling an important community need in terms of access to open spaces.ldquoThese spaces can be used for informal play and have the potential to help the council address other issues such as its obligation to identy places for community food growing.Scottish Borders Council recently spent pound, on a new playpark at Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre, near Ancrum, which follows on from new parks built in Galashiels, Oxton, and Stow.The council also opened up a new playpark in Hawick in  as part of the regeneration of WIlton Lodge Park, and Coldstream is set to be next to receive a new playpark with a pound, facility set to open in Home Park at the end of the month."},{"url":null,"title":"a pianist of distinction","story":"For her required performance, which lasted half an hour, Suen YeeSuen Yee started learning the piano with David McEwan when she was eight years old, working her way through the ABRSM gradesand finally the ARSM diploma.

The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation.

We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter childrens summer activities","story":"These activities, many of which have been provided free of charge, have been enjoyable and stimulating, not only for the youngsters but also the adults.We wish to express our sincere thanks to all those who gave their time and skills to delivering the activities.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

One way we can fight back against ecological collapse is to have wilder, unmown, unsprayed spaces around us.

The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"poll-support-eu-holding-new-indyref-rises","story":"A survey of how people feel on Brexit found that only  per cent favour the decision to quit the European Union, while almost % now say they are against the plan.This compares to the % in Scotland who voted to leave in the  referendum, compared to  % who wished to remain.Furthermore, the ongoing threat of crashing out without a withdrawal deal and the doom-laden prophecies of disruption at ports, empty supermarket shelves and civil disruption means that more than one-in-ten Scots said they are now \"terried\" by the prospect.The survey, filled in by  Herald readers asked them to list their biggest concerns over plans to leave the EU, with a No Deal Brexit being ranked top by almost half of those who responded.:Johnson may have made independence completely inevitable says Nicola SturgeonOther their concerns were that Brexit would bring threats to the economy and jobs, disruption to NHS supplies are treatment, and boost the far right in Britain.Almost % were worried that it might lead to Scotland leaving the UK, although % are worried that the current impasse at Westminster may lead to Brexit being cancelled.The survey, predominantly filled in by those in the -and-over age group, was taken last Thursday before Prime Minister Boris Johnsons plan to suspend Parliament was revealed.Among reasons given for being concerned about Brexit, one said: \"Becoming a vassal state to Donald Trumps America\", while another was worried about the UK turning inward, saying: \"My children are half-Finnish and I fear for the rise in racist attitudes and othering that is being legitimised in the UK.\"The Leave campaign was criticised, with one respondent saying they were concerned about: \"The legitimising of hate crime, racism and \"English exceptionalism\" that has accompanied the Leave campaign and its aftermath\" along with \"The invoking of jingoistic notions that should have died years ago and the demonising of our closest allies.\":Scottish Tories hiding in their bunker after Johnson moves to suspend Commons#Another added: \"I worry that the UK in general and Scotland in particular risk being more separate from European countries and more isolated economically, culturally and socially.

Aged , Stevenson had already left his stamp on the nationrsquos most treacherous stretches of coastline when he completed the erection of a lighthouse on Little Cumbrae in the Clyde.He was in his mid-s and had already crafted plans for a Bell Rock lighthouse when the HMS York disaster prompted calls for it to be adopted.In a remarkable feat of endeavour and bravery, workmen defied the crashing waves surrounding the rock to begin their excavation work in .It would take four years of construction before the towerrsquos first beam of light shone ndash alerting countless sailors down the years to the risk and saving innumerable lives in the process.The m tall white and black lighthouse remains the worldrsquos oldest surviving sea-washed lighthouse, although its keepers moved out in  and its light is now operated from the Northern Lighthouse Board offices at  George Street ndash a short distance from Leith Street where the Stevenson family made their base.Robert Stevenson went on to serve for nearly  years as engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board, overseeing the construction and improvements to lighthouses from Sumburgh Head in Shetland, to Barra Head at the southern entrance to The Minch and Scotlandrsquos southernmost point at the Mull of Galloway.His talent for civil engineering ran in the family: his sons, Alan, David and Thomas ndash father of Robert Louis Stevenson ndash would go on to follow in his footsteps.The brothersrsquo lighthouses stretch from the most northerly lighthouse in the British Isles at Muckle Flugga on the Island of Unst ndash  years old and still going strong - to the equally curiously named Chicken House lighthouse on an isolated rocky island at the southern tip of the Isle of Man.At the most isolated, Sule Skerry,  miles west of Orkney and designed to aid the passage of vessels through the Pentland Firth to and from the Iceland seas, keepers would spend a lonely month at a time with just seals, puffins and crashing waves for company.Perhaps the most challenging, however, was the construction of Skerryvore lighthouse. The graceful tower designed by Alan Stevenson is the tallest lighthouse in the country, measuring m of solid granite which were quarried on the Island of Mull throughout its six years of construction.Huge blocks of stone were ferried by tender to Hynish on Tiree to be dressed and shaped to ensure they fitted perfectly into place, before being taken to the site overlooking a reef of treacherous rocks around  miles south west of the island.The family firm was eventually passed to Davidrsquos sons, David Alan and Charles, in the s, and grandson, Charles.But while they continued to specialise in lighthouse design until the s ndash including lighthouses as far afield as New Zealand and Japan, the family also undertook a wide iety of work which helped transform travel and improve infrastructure.Mr Fleet points out that the maps and plans held by the Library show not only the remarkable attention to detail and vision of each designer, but in some cases the changing face of the locations such as harbours which were redesigned to make them safer and easier to navigate, rivers where work was carried out help improve the flow, and roads, bridges and canals which opened swathes of the nation to economic development.However, perhaps the biggest impact of their work is missing from the collection of maps, plans and documents: the countless lives their engineering skills saved."},{"url":null,"title":"hms-queen-elizabeth-set-sail-jet-trials-usa","story":"HMS Queen Elizabeth will depart from its home port of Portsmouth Naval Base on Friday for the deployment to the

cities produce around three quarters of the worldrsquos GDP and greenhouse gas emissions. They are also home to half the worldrsquos population ndash a figure that is expected to rise to between % and % by .In April this year, the Glasgow headquartered firm, Integrated Environmental Solutions IES Ltd, which has spent  years analysing the energy use and environmental impact of buildings, released a software suite designed to model multiple buildings simultaneously. These Intelligent Communities Lecycletools are already being used to monitor and model the impact and energy use of campuses, communities and cities.Dr Sarah Graham, ICL Consultant at IES says the software will enable people to create a digital representation of any group of buildings and their networks. This facilitates the planning and coordination of developments as they evolve, lessening their impact.ldquoThe idea is to provide a toolset that can address the problem of climate change on a citywide scale, she says. ldquoWe can create a live, D twin of any built environment to facilitate planning for the future. The model includes the buildings and the networks they run on, such as the electricity, water and gas, Graham explains.IES was founded in Scotland, on  June , by the current managing director, Dr Don Mclean. Its software and consultancy expertise are already in use by clients around the world, and the firm now employs over  staff. In addition to its Glasgow HQ, IES has offices in Dublin, Atlanta and Singapore, and representatives around the world, particularly in Australia, Europe and the Middle East.ldquoOur clients are major multi-disciplinary design firms around the world, along with universities, councils, corporations and city authorities. We do compliance work in a number of countries and we have a strong focus on optimising the design and operation of any building project. The tools enable lsquowhat rsquo scenarios to be tested at the design stage, and throughout the operational le cycle of the development, she explains.IESrsquos software can import metered data eg BMS, and AMR sensor data to model the dynamics of operation of a building or system which is a characteristic of a true digital twin.A virtual lsquotwinrsquo will test-run scenarios to identy optimal investments and improvements.As Graham explains, large buildings typically generate huge amounts of data from air conditioning, sensors and utility meters. The sheer volume of data makes it dficult for estate managers to make effective interventions. The ability to visualise all of the data on a single  uncovers unknown issues and opportunities for improvement.ldquoModelling the building management data in real time in a buildingrsquos D digital twin enables us to get an in-depth understanding of how the building is performing and what can be done to improve its performance, as we can virtually test dferent options. Clients are interested in how they can achieve zero carbon targets quickly and cost effectively.ldquoThe leaders of a university, or the management team at a hospital are faced with having to evaluate dferent potential solutions. Our software helps them model solutions, such as installing wind turbines, modying buildings, or incorporating energy storage, she notes.IES has helped organisations around the world to solve these kinds of queries. Another good example is a recent project at Dundalk Institute of Technology in Ireland where a team of students and researchers worked with support from IES. They factored in the cost of three options against their carbon targets to understand how best to invest. Graham also points to the Nanyang Technology University in Singapore, which has become the first ICL Living Lab, creating a full D model of the campus. This helps them to ensure that the buildings are all operating optimally and allows them to test Energy Conservation Measures already installed to decide how to achieve further savings.ldquoWhere we are dealing with a lot of building sensor data we use AI and machine learning to help to process that information, we can simply the view the management team get and customise it to what they want, thus reducing the burden on those iniduals. With the Internet of Things there will be more and more data available so itrsquos important we have robust means of capturing and processing that data and using the insights to inform decisions or drive the building systems. Think of the Hive control for home heating systems but on a much larger scale.Another recent example is the work IES has done on Orkney. ldquoA number of Scottish islands are off the grid and the communities see a benefit in being self-sufficient as far as electricity generation is concerned, Graham explains.The ICL tools can be used to model the energy demands and generation, at the same time, create a portal for the community to engage with the data. An example of this is Nottingham Trent Basin ndash a major residential development project. The project runs a PVarray with the largest storage battery in Europe. IES has created a model which residents can interact with via apps on phones or via a -inch screen on site. Researchers from Nottingham Trent University are involved in demonstrating the benefits of making the data accessible in order to mody behaviours to reduce electricity use.The way people behave inside a building or a cluster of buildings, has a major influence on emissions, she points out. ldquoWhen you know how a building is performing you can start incentivising iniduals to move towards a more responsible use of energy. This can have a really positive impact in the drive towards decarbonsation, she notes.With the Scottish Government having set a ldquonet zero-carbon target for Scotland to achieve by , the software clearly has a valuable role to play in helping local authorities and cities to get to grips with their emissions.ldquoCreating a virtual, digital twin of a campus, or even of a city, is a powerful way of understanding the dynamics and identying opportunities. To quote Lord Kelvin lsquoIf we donrsquot measure it we canrsquot improve itrsquo. Using the ICL any stakeholder can gain an understanding of the impact they and the built environment is having on the environment, Graham notes."},{"url":null,"title":"20 of the most unusual baby names chosen in 2018","story":"These are some of the most unusual baby names parents in England and Wales named their children in , according to the Office for National Statistics data..

The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat. It is a world-leading mobile solution for policing. It was developed here in Scotland in partnership with the police service, so it is fantastic to see that it will become available to , Police Scotland officers.“We look forward to working with Police Scotland and are proud to be part of this major milestone in mobile police technology.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Jose Manuel De La Cruz Mora, ZSLrsquos Segre-EDGE Fellow, based at the Natural History Museum of Pinar del Rio said: ldquoThe story of the Cuban funnel-eared bat really resonated with me as it reiterates the absolute need to ensure underappreciated species like bats donrsquot become lost to scientic history, simply because we forget to look.ldquoThough marking bats is very challenging and itrsquos typically done using necklaces, arm rings or wing punches, this can sometimes alter behaviour.ldquoAs the remaining population of the bats were so small and understanding their biology is fundamental to our research, we wanted to keep things as natural as possible, apart from their brightly coloured nails of course.ldquoIt was time-consuming giving each bat an inidual manicure, but itrsquos an incredible privilege to get up-close to this amazing animal and to discover more about them made all those hours painting their nails worth it.copy -.

That was simply extraordinary.The industry staffer who texted me painted an alarming picture that was repeated in many messages, photos and videos posted by passengers on social media into the night. “Cancelled trains lots” came the next text from my source. “Hundreds of passengers not able to get on services, police at almost every train for crowd control...no management in attendance...I can’t keep up with the disruption.”But even with Edinburgh Festival crowds and a Scotland v France rugby match at Murrayfield, how could this have happened  ScotRail is highly experienced at dealing with crowds from big events and, with new trains, it’s never had so many carriages on main lines from the capital such as to Glasgow and Dunblane.We await the findings of ScotRail’s internal inquiry, but it appears that a “perfect storm” of circumstances contributed to what appears to have resulted in near chaos, according to its definition as “complete disorder and confusion”.ScotRail operations director David Simpson said: “A number of unexpected incidents caused signicant issues on the network, with a trespassing incident and a train fault adding to a handful of cancellations following some late call offs.”Trains are understood to have been halted on a secondary Edinburgh-Glasgow line at Curriehill in western Edinburgh, and a train on the main line between the cities was stopped for  minutes at Linlithgow after a passenger activated an alarm because of the crush on board and the driver was unable to release the brakes.I have been told that two drivers’ shts had also not been covered and last-minute replacements had to be found, although ScotRail has not made clear whether this caused any further cancellations.On the basis of what we know so far and what I have been told from within the rail industry, two conclusions can be drawn.First, Saturday’s events demonstrate once again that the railways are a sitting duck, prone to disruption from a wide range of causes over which they have no control. This can be anything from people straying onto tracks, as happened, to others, all too often, taking their own lives. Trees on adjoining land can blow down, damaging overhead power lines. Even fires in nearby garages have stopped services because of explosion dangers.Trains can’t steer round obstacles like on the roads, and there are often no ersion routes.But secondly, I hear that despite ScotRail’s new trains and recruiting more staff, it still has limited resilience when situations escalate.While many of its new electric fleet has arrived, most of the refurbished diesel trains for long distance inter-city routes have yet to go into service because of problems with upgrading work by other firms. There are also still not enough additional drivers yet trained.A further factor is that despite all the disruption, ScotRail is still seeing underlying passenger growth.

After eight years on the front line of campaign after campaign she has, as they say in sport, left nothing on the pitch.The debt the Scottish party owes her is enormous, illustrated by the army of elected representatives, amongst whom I am one, but there is no point looking for the next Ruth Davidson because we will never find one.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

However, he says that he hopes his run will raise awareness of mental health issues and suicide.“I’ve done several charitable runs in the past, but my main inspiration has been kids who have a certain condition and affliction and their parents seem quite helpless,” he explains.“I felt I couldn’t really help them in any way, so the only thing I could think of was to run to raise money for the charities that help them. I hate running, but it’s the only way I could help – I can’t do anything like a doctor would do or a counsellor would do.“Unfortunately depression, anxiety, suicide and mental health issues are getting worse in Northern Ireland, especially around West Belfast and North Belfast, which is really, really sad. For many people they don’t feel like they can talk to anyone or that they can speak up, because there’s still a lot of stigma attached to it, which is wrong. “We all go through issues, we all have problems – others might be better able to deal with them men in particular struggle to open up, but we all need to offload. If you have a toothache you’ll go to the dentist before it falls out,you have a sore leg you’ll go to the doctor before it breaks, but people ignore every sign from their minds that they need help. “It will help you in the long run and there is help available. There are charities that do it for free and they offer an amazing service. I myself have availed of it. I went to see a counsellor when I was having a tough time of it, and somebody took me aside and said ‘you need help’ and I’m glad I did, otherwise I might have been more unfortunate. “Depression is indiscriminate, whether you’re rich or poor, young or old, it can affect everyone. It’s important to be sympathetic to someone in that situation, because it could be you, your best friend or family member that needs that help. Hopefully, this run will be able to raise more awareness about these issues.”"},{"url":null,"title":"amber rudd northern ireland businesses and workers have every right to feel optimistic about future","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Local employment is at a record high with , more people in a job since , and unemployment is just .% - below the UK average of .%. Even fewer women are out of work in Northern Ireland, just .%, with women making up well over half of new workers in that time.Yesterday I met some of the organisations in Belfast helping to drive that employment boom. In particular with Youth Action Northern Ireland, who work with , young people every year, helping them to build future careers in areas like performing arts, business and technology.As the Work and Pensions Secretary Im responsible for overseeing the welfare reforms that are helping more people get into work, with Universal Credit offering every jobseeker a personal work coach and the tailored support they need to overcome whatever barriers they face.Following the Fresh Start Agreement, Universal Credit was introduced here as well in the last few years.On my visit I met with officials from the Department for Communities working to make sure people here experience a smooth transition to the new system, benefiting from its flexibility and simplicity.Its right that issues like welfare reform, which have such a big impact on the people of Northern Ireland, are decided on by their representatives here in Stormont.So like the rest of the Government, I also urge the political parties in Northern Ireland to work quickly to restore devolved government at Stormont. The people of Northern Ireland need to have confidence that decisions are being made by local politicians who represent them.Businesses certainly have confidence in Northern Ireland workers. In the last four years alone over , more people have been employed by private companies here. As weve created a more favourable business environment across the UK, easing regulation and lowering corporation tax, weve seen private enterprise flourish. There are , businesses based in Northern Ireland, almost , more than there were in . Yesterday I also met some of the  entrepreneurs creating new businesses here in Belfast with the help of Catalyst - a charity offering mentoring support and office space to new start-ups.Based at Belfasts historic docks near the Game of Thrones studios, it is a prime example of how Northern Irelands former industrial centre is becoming a new economic powerhouse for arts and technology.Im also encouraged by public signs from Harland  Wolffs administrators looking for a new buyer for the company.As the Northern Ireland Secretary has said, while its a commercial process, the Government will do all it can to support a successful bid. Jobseekers in Northern Ireland should be optimistic about their future.Wages are rising faster than the UK average and workers here earn an average of £ a week more than they did five years ago. Employment is booming.Game of Thrones has ended, and like many fans I was sad to say goodbye to Westeros. But with the worlds most popular TV programme creating a legacy for its arts and entertainment industry, with its new wave of entrepreneurs and with near full-employment, Im confident that optimism is well founded."},{"url":null,"title":"david ervines widow pleads for northern ireland parties to engage and find solutions to impasse","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I think some of my colleagues have hooked onto this as well. \"Im not the only one who is interested to see justice being done in this particular case,\" he added.Lord Maginnis said peers were shocked when they learned of what had happened in the NIO. \"There was, literally right across the board, a concern and an undercurrent of anger that this could happen,\" he said.DUP leader Arlene Foster said that she was \"glad\" the matter had been resolved.\"The Secretary of State has made the right decision but questions remain as to how the NIO allowed this situation to develop,\" she said.Mrs Foster added that it was \"deeply embarrassing for a UK Government department\".TUV leader Jim Allister said the portrait should never have been taken down in the first place, but he was delighted that it was back.\"I would like to thank the Secretary of State Julian Smith for expediting theof the portrait to its rightful place,\" he said.Ulster Unionist peer Lord Rogan said that despite the portraits , there was still the question of why it was removed in the first place.He said: \"I welcome reports that the Queens portrait has been restored to its proper place in Stormont House. I am glad that some common sense has been applied. If, as it appears, this was due to the influence of Secretary of State Julian Smith, fair play to him.\""},{"url":null,"title":"minister to consider findings of scathing broadband report","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The deterioration in the reef’s outlook mostly reflects the expanding area of coral killed or damaged by bleaching.The report said the threats – which include the star-of-thorns starfish that prey on coral polyps – are “multiple, cumulative and increasing.”Authority chairman Ian Poiner said: “The accumulation of impacts, through time and over an increasing area, is reducing its ability to recover from disturbances, with implications for reef-dependent communities and industries.“The overall outlook for the Great Barrier Reef is very poor.”The Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report has downgraded the health of the reef to very poor.

Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"nerve visual gallery close doors ebrington","story":"The Nerve Visual Gallery at Ebrington is set to close at the beginning of next month, the Derry News has learned.The announcement will come as a great disappointment to art lovers in the city who have frequented the gallery over the past number of years and will be a loss to the Ebrington site.When it first opened in  it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.However, at the weekend a spokesperson for The Executive Officeconfirmed: “The Nerve Centre has operated a gallery in a section of the Creative Hub Building   on the Ebrington Site for three years and gave notice that they intend to close the gallery on  September .“The Executive Office is currently considering options for the section occupied by Nerve Gallery.”Located in the former army barracks at Ebrington, the Nerve Centre developed a series of major visual arts commissions with partners including - Now, National Museums NI, The Fondation Gilles Caron, Gallery of Photography Dublin, Ultra Lab Madrid and Matts Gallery London.Exhibitions have shone a light on pivotal moments in Northern Ireland’s history such as the Civil Rights movement and the Troubles.The Lost Moment exhibition looked anew at the Civil Rights movement fty years on from the marches and peaceful protests that immediately preceded the Troubles.

This will ensure that this important local landmark will be secure for generations to come and visitors to the town can continue to enjoy it as a back.The parishrsquos project convenor, Dennis Constable said: ldquoThis repair work will ensure that people will still be able to visit the church and enjoy looking at the heritage and the wonderful stained glass windows.ldquoThe church also holds many treasures of history that stretch back in Newcastlersquos history and which are relevant to many people.He added: ldquoThe repairs, which include the bell tower  will provide for the church bells, which have been silent for so long, to once again to be rung..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Border Cup set to start  ","story":"CUP action continues to dominate the local soccer scene with the countdown to Christmas joy beginning on Saturday.Thatrsquos when the first round of the prestigious Border Cup takes place with eight local teams in action.Top billing goes to the game at Robert Adams Park between Kilmore Rec and Portaferry.Other ties include Grove United v Killyleagh YC, Drumaness Mills v Greenisland, Holywood FC v Ballynahinch Olympic, Aquinas v Ballynahinch United, Comber Rec v Bangor Swts and Saintfield United v Bryansburn Rangers.

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline.

the town for a day in Newcastle which to some excited children at the time seemed like a million miles away when in reality it was literally only up the road.New shoes and clothes were purchased ahead of the annual excursion so everyone was looking their best, with families gathering at the St Dillonrsquos Avenue sports pitches before marching to the townrsquos bus station via Edward Street, John Street, Irish Street and Market Street.A fun-filled day was spent in Newcastle, when the summers always felt warmer than they are today, with families ing home by bus, exhausted after a frantic but

sparked calls for action to be taken against teenagers terrorising the community in the Model Farm and Flying Horse areas.A number of cars were again pelted with stones as they drove along the Killough Road, while several fires were also started on Saturday evening.On Sunday, part of the Brannish Road was reported to be barricaded with branches and supermarket trolleys with young people targeting passing cars with stones.The most disturbing incident occurred on Monday evening when a woman driving alone was left frightened after her car was stoned on the Brannish Road as she made her way to work.Police have confirmed that they are aware of the recent trouble and warned those responsible for the unruly behaviour that their involvement could lead to a criminal record and harm their future university and employment prospects.Officers have also appealed to anyone who can assist them with their enquiries to contact them as they work to apprehend those responsible for the trouble.The Flying Horse Ward Community Forum mdash which earlier this year organised a public protest to call for an end to trouble at this part of the town mdash has condemned the weekend incidents.The grouprsquos chairwoman, Lisa Perry, said the continuing trouble was ldquosimply not acceptable and must end. She also appealed to parents to know where their children are and what they are doing.Ms Perry said children need to be taught to respect the community where they live, the people of the Model Farm and Flying Horse areas and those who commute along the Killough Road.ldquoResidents and those who use the Killough Road should not have to put up with such behaviour and anyone who knows who is responsible should contact the police, she said.Ms Perry said the message must go out that stoning cars is not acceptable and that those responsible will not be be allowed to get away with what they are doing.ldquoIt does not bear thinking about what would happena driver whose car is stoned loses control of the vehicle and crashes into pedestrians or someonersquos home. Those who throw missiles at cars need to realise the potential consequences of what they are doing. For drivers, this is a terribly frightening experience.Angry residents have also taken to social media to voice their concern about the trouble which has been prevalent at this part of Downpatrick for many years.Parents have also been urged to warn their children not to get involved in behaviour which could lead to serious consequences, with residents branding those responsible for the trouble as ldquodisgraceful. They said their parents should be doing more to stop the unruly behaviour, expressing concern that the trouble has been allowed to continue for too long and must be stopped.ldquoThe trouble is too frequent, said one woman, while a man revealed his van was stoned on two occasions at the Killough Road last month. Worryingly, he reported that children as young as  were responsible.Another resident expressed concern that a driver could lose control of their car after being stoned which could result in a crash and someone being seriously injured.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said local police must respond swtly to the anti-social behaviour, especially after Monday nightrsquos incident when a woman was attacked.ldquoThere has been an escalation of the anti-social behaviour in the Flying Horse and Model Farm area from a number of youths. Cars have been stoned, fires started and people assaulted. This behaviour is unacceptable, he declared.ldquoThe perceived inactivity of the authorities cannot be allowed to send a message that such behaviour is acceptable.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”Lord Maginnis said that the settlement “was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens”.Sir Jonathan remains as the NIO’s permanent secretary, its most senior official.A month ago the News Letter revealed that all images of the Queen – even one of her shaking hands with Martin McGuinness – were then banned from the walls of Stormont House. NIO minister Lord Duncan said at the time that the department “takes steps to ensure no such images are displayed in Stormont House”.Reacting to widespread criticism of the move, new Secretary of State Julian Smith then tweeted a small image of the Queen on the mantel piece of his private office within the building, but the NIO declined to say whether it had only been placed there in response to criticism of the initial decision.Mr Smith ordered a civil service review of the initial decisions. Despite having begun at the height of the holiday season, that review has now been completed in an unusually brisk time frame for the slow-turning wheels of bureaucracy.The News Letter understands that a photo of the Queen on her own has been placed in the main entrance corridor of Stormont House - the first place where guests go when visiting the property - along with another image of the Queen with Irish President Michael D Higgins and an image of Prince Charles in a church with the Anglican and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh.The images are part of a wider series of photos, one of which is of commemorations at the Ulster Tower for the fallen at the Somme. Officials believe the images as a whole represent a balanced range.A source close to Secretary of State Julian Smith said: “The Secretary of State was clear that the Head of State’s image should be on display in Stormont House.” pictured outside the High Court in Belfast where he was seeking an emergency injunction stopping Boris Johnson from suspending Parliament.

At the time of Lord Maginnis’s remarks, all that the NIO would say was: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”The NIO said: “A portrait of the Queen – our head of state – is on display in the public area of Stormont House alongside a balanced set of images celebrating and reflecting the work of the Northern Ireland Office.”try catch  TrendingWoman whose body was found in NI town has

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Jose Manuel De La Cruz Mora, ZSLrsquos Segre-EDGE Fellow, based at the Natural History Museum of Pinar del Rio said: ldquoThe story of the Cuban funnel-eared bat really resonated with me as it reiterates the absolute need to ensure underappreciated species like bats donrsquot become lost to scientic history, simply because we forget to look.ldquoThough marking bats is very challenging and itrsquos typically done using necklaces, arm rings or wing punches, this can sometimes alter behaviour.ldquoAs the remaining population of the bats were so small and understanding their biology is fundamental to our research, we wanted to keep things as natural as possible, apart from their brightly coloured nails of course.ldquoIt was time-consuming giving each bat an inidual manicure, but itrsquos an incredible privilege to get up-close to this amazing animal and to discover more about them made all those hours painting their nails worth it..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Rare bat population given  umanicures u so numbers can be counted article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to ..

Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee. Location Since the inception of the Top  we have periodically looked at the geographic location of the companies within Northern Ireland – historically the east of the province has held sway over the west – however, we are beginning to see a sht with currently  businesses based in Belfast, Co Antrim and Co Down, with Co Tyrone being a major recipient of Top  activity. Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
